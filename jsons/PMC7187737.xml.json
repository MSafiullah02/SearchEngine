In a journal pre-proof, another group of French investigators repeated the study in 10 patients and 80% were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at Days 5\u20136 after treatment initiation.(27) Finally, in a Chinese pilot study of 30 patients, 15 received CHQ, 13 tested negative for SARS CoV-2 after a week of treatment vs 14 of the controls.(28)",

All were confirmed cases and had markedly elevated IL-6. All patients improved over the next few days with an initial resolution of fever, improvement in gas exchange, normalization of the CRP by Day 5 and clearing of pulmonary infiltrates.(34) No short-term adverse events were reported. All of the patients had deteriorated despite routine therapies in the previous week, and the agent is now listed as a treatment option for severe or critical cases with elevated IL-6 in the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guide.(35) A very recent case study has described the successful use of Tmab in a patient on maintenance therapy for multiple myeloma who had received bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone therapy approximately 4 years previously and had been on thalidomide maintenance since then. He presented with a shortness of breath only but responded rapidly to Tmab after having deteriorated despite the oral antiviral therapy, umifenovir 200 mg/8 h.(36)",
