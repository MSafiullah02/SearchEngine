Each year, more than two million Muslims from around the world travel to Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj in the holy city of Makkah. On the first day, pilgrims start the \u201cTawaf\u201d by circumambulating the \u201cHoly Kaaba\u201d for seven times, then the \u201cSa\u2019i\u201d by walking between the two hills of Safa and Marwah in the grand mosque, for seven times for a total of 3 km. Eventually, the pilgrims depart to the tent city of Mina, around 5 km to the east of Makkah, where they spend the night in groups distributed in tents. Upon sunrise of the second day, pilgrims leave to Mount Arafat, where many Muslims ascend the hill of the mount of Mercy and spend the day repenting and praying. At dusk, pilgrims descend from Arafat and arrive in the valley of Muzdalifah where they spend the night in tents and collect small stones for the symbolic stoning of the devil. On the third day, Muslims move to Mina where they stay until the fifth day of Hajj performing the stoning of the devil at the Jamaraat pillars in Mina. Finally, they finish their Hajj ritual by going back to the holy mosque in Makkah to perform \u201cTawaf\u201d.",

In fact, acute respiratory infections are very common during Hajj and represent the leading cause of the most hospitalizations.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 It has been suggested that more than one\u2010third of pilgrims will suffer from respiratory symptoms during Hajj mostly due to the respiratory viruses.2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Most commonly isolated viruses from symptomatic patients during Hajj were human rhinoviruses (hRVs), influenza virus and non\u2010MERS human coronaviruses (hCoVs).2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\n",

Since 2012, MERS\u2010CoV caused more than 2250 confirmed cases in 27 countries in the Arabian Peninsula, Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America as of December 2018.21, 22 Furthermore, multiple hospitals and household outbreaks have been reported mostly in the Saudi Arabia.23, 24, 25 More importantly, most global MERS cases were linked to travel to the Arabian peninsula. Although all surveillance studies during Hajj did not reveal any MERS\u2010CoV infection among pilgrims,10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 serological testing showed positivity in one Turkish pilgrim who suffered from severe pneumonia and died upon ICU admission in Turkey.6 Similarly, confirmed cases were reported from Dutch pilgrims returning home from the minor pilgrimage \u201cUmrah\u201d.32 While these studies suggest that MERS\u2010CoV might not be problematic during Hajj so far, transmission of MERS\u2010CoV is always possible especially during these mass\u2010gathering events which could further lead to global spread. Therefore, MERS\u2010CoV surveillance is highly warranted among pilgrims during and after Hajj. In this study, we performed enhanced surveillance for MERS\u2010CoV and other respiratory viruses among individuals with severe respiratory manifestation who presented to primary healthcare facilities during 2014 Hajj.",

Of the total patients, 50.8% (67 of 132) tested positive for one or more viruses with males representing 62.7% (42 of 67) of the virally infected patients compared with females who represented 37.3% (25 of 67) (Table 1). As shown in Table 1, although a majority of positive patients were older than 60 years, this difference was not significant. No statistical significance was found for comparisons of infection rates among males and females or the different age groups. One hundred and twenty\u2010nine of the patients in this study were from 37 countries mostly from Asia and Africa followed by Europe and North America. Nationalities of three individuals were unknown. As expected, viruses were more commonly detected in patients from countries providing the largest number of pilgrims such as India and Indonesia (Figure 1), however, detected viruses were diverse and we did not observe any specific pattern in circulating viruses in patients from India and Indonesia compared with other countries.",

While MERS\u2010CoV was not detected in any of the tested samples, other viral etiologies were determined (Table 2). The most commonly detected viruses were flu A (27.8%, 27 of 97), hRV A/B (16.5%, 16 of 97), hCoV OC43 (15.5%, 15 of 97), flu B (13.4%, 13 of 97), and hCoV 229E (9.2%, 9 of 97). In single infections, flu A and B were the most frequent followed by non\u2010MERS hCoVs and hRV (Table 2). On the other hand, the most common coinfecting virus was hCoV OC43 with the detection rate of 20.4% (11 of 54) of the coinfecting viruses in which it was detected in 11 out of the 24 coinfected individuals. This was followed by flu A (18.5%, 10 of 54), hRV A/B (18.5%, 10 of 54), hAdv C/E (9.3%, 5 of 54), hCoV 229E (9.3%, 5 of 54), hRSV A/B (7.4%, 4 of 54), and flu B (7.4%, 4 of 54). The most common coinfections were due to the hCoV OC43 with either flu A or flu B (3 of 24 in each case) followed by flu A with either hAdv C or hRV A (2 of 24 in each case) (Table 3). Coinfections with more than two viruses were not uncommon. In fact, four patients had triple concurrent infections, and one patient had a quadruple concurrent infection (Table 3). The remaining nine coinfections were due to the unique combination of respiratory viruses (Table 3). Not surprisingly, flu A, flu B, and hCoV OC43 were the most frequently detected viruses in the most age groups (Table 3). Patterns of detected respiratory viruses suggest that the most frequently detected viruses in this study such as flu A, flu B, hCoV OC43, and hRV were circulating during almost all the 5 days of Hajj compared with less common viruses such as hPIV 3, hCoV NL63, and EV (Figure 2).",

This rate is markedly higher than the previously reported.10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 38 Furthermore, while most of these reports have identified hRVs as the most coinfecting viruses during Hajj, our data showed hCoV OC43 as the most prevalent coinfecting virus followed by flu A and hRVs.10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 38 These marked differences most probably were due to technical and methodological differences. However, it is clear that enhanced surveillance using detection assays with high sensitivity and coverage such as microarray and multiplex PCR could enhance our understanding of pathogens involved in respiratory infections during mass gatherings and ultimately lead to better infection control.",

            "text": "Most Hajj pilgrims are usually old adults and elderly representing a high\u2010risk group for influenza infection especially with the apparent high prevalence of influenza viruses during Hajj. These individuals are more susceptible to influenza viruses and prone to develop severe diseases. While seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all pilgrims, current Hajj regulations and guidelines for influenza vaccination require usage of seasonal trivalent vaccine formulation recommended for people younger than 65 years. These vaccines are known to be less immunogenic and less effective in the elderly compared with younger adults. In addition, the several studies have shown low vaccination coverage among pilgrims attending multiple Hajj seasons.9, 13, 20, 26, 29, 30, 39 Furthermore, detection of influenza viruses is not uncommon among vaccinated individuals during Hajj or in returning pilgrims, mostly due to a possible mismatch between circulating and vaccine strains.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 26, 29, 30, 38, 40, 41, 42 Therefore, it is highly suggested to implement and adopt new influenza immunization guidelines for Hajj to improve vaccine coverage and to provide sufficient protection against influenza. Possible changes could include the use of quadrivalent influenza vaccines, high\u2010dose vaccines for people older than 65 years and/or inclusion of both influenza vaccines from the northern and southern hemispheres for people younger than 65 years, especially if the two vaccines are different. Moreover, it might be beneficial to enhance human influenza surveillance during Hajj by including genetic and antigenic characterization of circulating strains to ensure strain match and to anticipate any potential early introduction of influenza viruses into Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, it is suggested that countries with pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia enhance their surveillance for influenza viruses.",

First, the use of upper respiratory samples, NP swabs, for MERS\u2010CoV detection may have led to missed MERS cases since they have lower viral load than that in lower respiratory specimens.43 However, NP swabs were used because of their easy collection and acceptance by pilgrims compared with bronchoalveolar lavages or tracheal aspirates, especially if there is no clinical indication. Second, it is possible that some MERS cases were also missed due to the asymptomatic infections or mild clinical symptoms. Therefore, larger sampling from pilgrims and their contacts as well as further testing for seroconversion might be used in future studies. Another limitation is that the microarray assay used in this study does not test for bacteria, which have been shown to represent a significant part of etiologies of respiratory illness during Hajj,12, 19 or hRV C, which could represent a significant number of potential rhinovirus infections among symptomatic pilgrim.",

While MERS\u2010CoV was not detected in any of the patients, a variety of other respiratory viruses has been found in more than half of the patients with many coinfections with multiple viruses. Our observation as well as the previous reports from Hajj indicate that enhanced and active surveillance during Hajj seasons is critical to recognize the wide variety of pathogens that might be involved in Hajj epidemics and to implement proper infection control measures. Importantly, there is an evident risk of influenza infection among pilgrims underscoring the need for targeted, active and continuous surveillance for influenza viruses not only to monitor viral circulation but also to characterize circulating viruses to better understand vaccine effectiveness and to recognize the need to improve current influenza vaccination strategies during Hajj.",
