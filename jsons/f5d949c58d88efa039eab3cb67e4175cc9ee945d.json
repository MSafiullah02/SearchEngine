Also, it is unwise to invest in general category ETFs, such as BRIC or general emerging market ETFs. Each country in these categories is vastly different, as are their growth rates. Therefore, these funds will not necessarily capture the potential of a given country. Most likely they will only represent the volatility of all the markets.

The private equity firm Oaktree faced this problem when it tried to buy out Fu Sheng, the world's largest manufacturer of golf club heads. Fu Sheng would have been delisted after the sale. After some delays, the Fu Sheng deal was approved. 10 Despite the friction, the main issue with Taiwan is its relationship with mainland China. Much of the success of Chinese exporters is not actually due to the Chinese. It is due to Taiwanese-owned businesses that have invested in China. For example, Foxconn is the contract manufacturer for much of the electronics sold under different brands, which may include Apple's iPads and iPods and Nintendo and Microsoft game consoles and laptops. It is a Taiwanese company headquartered in Taipei. The Taiwanese use cheaper Chinese labor. Foxconn alone employs 270,000 people at its factory complex in Shenzhen. But the manufacturing techniques-such as flexible productionthat are often credited to the Chinese originate with Taiwanese manufacturers. 11 However, Taiwanese businessmen often have a much different experience in China than those from developed countries. Because the Chinese know the Taiwanese government treads very softly regarding its relationship with the mainland, the Taiwanese can expect little protection. The result is that these businessmen are often the victims of rapacious government officials. For example, in one case, a Taiwanese businessman found that seven million yuan ($1.01 million) had disappeared from his Bank of China account. \"They told 9 \"Corruption in Taiwan: Confirming the Worst Suspicions: The arrest of three senior judges sparks renewed debate over corruption,\" The Economist, www.economist.com/node/16647375, July 22, 2010. me I had never deposited seven million yuan in my account,\" Peng said. \"Apparently, someone inside the bank took the money-even some people from within the bank told me that.\" 12 It is not uncommon for Taiwanese businesses to suffer all sorts of expropriations, from real estate to intellectual property. The head of Taiwanese electronics giant Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd. criticized Warren Buffet's investment in the Chinese battery maker BYD, which Hon Hai sued for intellectual property violations. 13 Taiwanese businessmen are fair game because they know if they complain too loudly, they will be arrested. So, often they just flee and don't return.",

Ferrier Hodgson got nowhere. It finally had to accept a bid by an unknown company named Golden Concord, whose management included unidentified Asia Aluminum executives. Golden Concord offered 20 cents on the dollar for the senior bonds and only one cent on the dollar for the $800 million worth of junior bonds.

Indonesia not only has oil, but much of the recent boom has been fueled by coal-to say nothing of gold and all its other natural resources. The pernicious effects of a natural resources bonanza without strong institutions to control it allows for a constant and never-ending gravy train of patronage to an ever-expanding band of government rentiers. An example is that despite this vast natural 25 Anthony Deutsch and Henny Sender, \"Indonesia: Regional economic boom,\" Financial Times, www.ft.com, June 7, 2011. wealth, Indonesia has an infrastructure that is far worse than even Brazil's. According to a government study, there is a need for $150 billion in physical infrastructure, including roads, sea and airports, electricity plants, and bridges by 2014. But Indonesia can only seem to find a third of that in its limited state budget. 28 For direct and indirect investors, Indonesia certainly does show the promise of an emerging market. Besides all the natural resources, it also has a rising middle class that now numbers about 50 million. But despite a population where the median age is under 30 and literacy rates are close to 90%, Indonesia has lagged behind in manufacturing, another aspect of the curse of oil.",

Thanks to the lessons taught by Ms. Gordillo, Mexico's education system performs on a par with the schools in Jordan, which is half as rich.

In 2010, Chinese companies raised three times more money from bonds as they did from equities. The sales continued to break records this year. Chinese corporate yuan-denominated bond sales totaled over 100 billion yuan ($15.2 billion), up 60% over 2010. Dollar-denominated bonds did even better.

This exit strategy is probably closed. China's banking regulator has been cracking down on trust companies' loans, specifically loans to Greentown. 58 The foreign bond holders of Greentown were lucky to receive their investments back.

The combination of high yields and potential currency appreciation was irresistible. Many local Russian companies were happy to take advantage of this opportunity to issue international bonds denominated in rubles. It sounds like a good idea, unless problems develop. The market is illiquid, shallow, and new, so it will be more vulnerable to selloffs than the dollar-denominated or local ruble bond markets.",

The Bank of Moscow is Russia's fifth largest bank, whose shareholders include Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse. VTB, the state-controlled lender and Russia's second largest bank, recently bought 46.5% of the bank. What it found on the bank's books caused a scandal. There was a $14 billion hole in its balance sheet and questionable loans worth billions of dollars to businesses related to Bank of Moscow senior managers. This was bad enough. The real problem was that not only was the Bank of Moscow's $2 billion in foreign currency bonds placed in question, but so were $8 billion of VTB's own foreign currency bonds.",
