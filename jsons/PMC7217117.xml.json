On March 7, 2020, she underwent elective repair of her ankle injury. During extubation from the orthopedic procedure, frothy pink sputum was noted. The patient was isolated, tested for COVID-19, and found to be positive. She was soon reintubated and was transferred to a tertiary care center near Denver, Colorado on March 13, 2020. She developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was proned. On March 19, 2020, she was placed on veno-venous ECMO. On March 22, 2020, she received her first of nine doses of compassionate use Remdesivir. On March 27, 2020, her respiratory status improved and her ECMO flow and ventilatory settings were weaned. Two days later, on March 29, 2020, after 10 days on ECMO, she was successfully decannulated and separated from ECMO. On April 1, 2020, she was extubated. On April 8, 2020, she was discharged from the hospital on room air and went to a rehabilitation facility for her orthopedic injury.",

Among COVID-19 patients which have received ECMO, a strong positive correlation exists between mortality and high cytokine levels, most notably IL-6.15,22\u201324 Ruan et al24 documented that IL-6 concentrations differed significantly between survivors and nonsurvivors of COVID-19, with nonsurvivors having up to 1.7-times higher values.22 Multiple therapeutic strategies might mitigate \u201ccytokine storm,\u201d including antibody therapies (e.g., Tocilizumab, Sarilumab, Siltuximab), therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), and even direct removal of cytokines. TPE can reduce cytokine levels by separating and removing plasma from blood and replacing the removed plasma with fresh frozen plasma.25 CytoSorb (https://cytosorbents.com/products/cyto-sorb/) is an extracorporeal cytokine adsorber that has been approved in the European Union to reduce toxic levels of cytokines; this technology might be combined with ECMO to treat cytokine storm associated with sever COVID-19 pneumonia. Initial experience with this approach has recently been reported.26,27 It is a fact that each of these theoretical treatment options merit additional investigation.",

Although our experience is the largest published analysis of COVID-19 patients treated with ECMO to date, we recognize that our dataset is relatively small, and we plan to continue gathering data to provide additional insight as to guideposts for patient selection and predictors of outcomes. It is our hope that by sharing our experience, other centers and patients may benefit.",

Additional gathering and analysis of data will inform appropriate selection of patients and provide guidance as to best use of ECMO in terms of timing, implementation, duration of support, and best criteria for discontinuation. A tremendous amount of information still needs to be learned about the role of ECMO in treating patients these sickest of patients with COVID-19.",
