The data in Fig. 2, Fig. 3\nA indicated that the mice and rabbits immunized with the inactivated viruses developed high titers of antibodies against the S protein. The mean end-point titers of mouse and rabbit antisera were 1:51,200 and 1:25,600, respectively. It is expected that antibodies reacting with the S protein may contain an antibody population specific for the S1 region since S1 is a major antigenic determinant in the S protein [24]. We therefore used recombinant S1-C9 as an antigen in ELISA and found that the antibody titers against S1 were comparable to those against the full-length S protein (Fig. 2, Fig. 3B). We then determined whether the antisera reacted with RBD within S1 region since it is a functional domain in S protein responsible for mediating virus binding to the receptor ACE2 [14], [15], [16], [17] and contains neutralizing epitopes [25]. RBD-Fc fusion protein was used as a coating antigen in the ELISA for testing the reactivities of mouse and rabbit antisera. Strikingly, both mouse and rabbit antisera were highly reactive with the RBD-Fc with mean end-point titers of 1:51,200 and 1:25,600, respectively (Fig. 2, Fig. 3C), at similar levels of responses against the full-length S protein. This suggests that the RBD on the S protein of the inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine preparation is a major antigenic determinant capable of inducing potent antibody responses in the immunized animals.",

Prior experiences in infectious disease control suggest that vaccination will be one of the most effective measures to prevent SARS epidemic. Generally, the inactivated virus has been considered as a first generation vaccine to prevent viral infectious disease. Therefore, inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine has been developed as one of the major vaccine candidates [8]. Most recently, a vaccine prepared from whole SARS-CoV inactivated with \u03b2-propiolactone is being tested in a clinical trial in China [10]. However, there is serious concern over its efficacy and safety in humans since the antigenic properties of inactivated SARS-CoV have not been clearly defined [8].",

This suggests that the S protein in the inactivated SARS vaccine preparation maintains its high immunogenicity in the mice and rabbits. This is crucial for development of the inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine since it has been shown that the S protein of SARS-CoV is a major antigen capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity [6], [7], [9], [23]. We have recently shown that the RBD is a major antigenic determinant in the SARS-CoV S protein and that the RBD can induce high titers of SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies [25]. Here we have demonstrated that the inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine is able to induce high titers of antibodies to RBD, suggesting that this domain is correctly folded in the vaccine preparation and retains appropriate epitopic conformation for eliciting neutralizing antibodies. The antibodies in the antisera from mice and rabbits immunized with the inactivated SARS-CoV could effectively block RBD binding to the receptor ACE2 and potently inhibit S protein-mediated virus entry into susceptible cells, indicating that the antibodies in the immunized animals are specific for the RBD of the S protein and responsible for inhibition of SARS-CoV entry.",

            "text": "Although the RBD in S protein of SARS-CoV can induce potent neutralizing activity, the safety of the inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine should be fully evaluated before it is tested in human clinical trials. The S protein also contains other immunodominant domains which elicit non-neutralizing antibodies [24]. The S protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), a coronavirus, induces antibodies in the immunized animals that do not neutralize, but rather enhance infection after virus challenge [29], [30], [31]. In addition to the S protein, coronaviruses also contain other proteins, which may induce humoral or cellular immune responses that exacerbate the pathology in some coronavirus infections [32]. Some proteins in SARS-CoV may induce harmful immune and/or inflammatory responses, a potential cause of SARS pathogenesis [33], [34]. It was reported that SARS-CoV infection of ferrets caused mild liver inflammation and that the liver damage became much more serious if the ferrets were immunized with vaccinia virus-based SARS vaccines before virus challenge [35]. Most recently, Wang and Lu [36] reported that an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine triggered an autoimmune response against the carbohydrate moieties in an abundant human serum glycoprotein asialo-orosomucoid. Therefore, caution should be taken in application of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine for prevention of SARS. The antigens that induce harmful immune and/or inflammatory responses should be identified and removed from vaccines. Preparations containing the RBD of S protein may serve as one of the most effective and safest vaccines for the prevention of SARS [25].",
