The conditions used to prepare the vaccine are not only ideal for growth of the vaccine organism, but also capable of propagating adventitious (inadvertent) microbiological contaminants. Such contaminants may include bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, mollicutes (mycoplasmas, spiroplasmas, acholeplasmas), agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (e.g., bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)), and viruses, including bacteriophage. Of particular difficulty for current detection methods is addressing the vast array of viral organisms, which vary considerably in terms of size, shape, content of lipid membranes (enveloped or nonenveloped), and content of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA, single-stranded, double-stranded, contiguous, or segmented genome); as well as varying in their sensitivity to inactivation procedures or efficiency of removal (by purification) procedures.",

Thus, strategies to control risk of product contamination entail implementing a number of product design elements, rather than testing for presence or absence. One strategy is to eliminate, to the extent possible, exposure to animal- and human-derived raw materials. This is not always feasible, and often cannot be implemented in regards to legacy products, without risk of altering in unknown ways a product of established safety and efficacy. Foremost among the possible strategies is controlling what materials to which the product is exposed by appropriate donor screening and geographic sourcing, as well as traceability and documentation, and in the case of BSE risk, eliminating high-risk specified risk materials from the collection process at the abattoir. Information on this topic may be obtained from http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/ucm111476.htm and http://www.emea.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500003700.pdf (EMA 2011). Taking another strategy, work by staff of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Piccardo et al. 2011) has shown that many vaccine cell substrates did not propagate highly infectious BSE or variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease agents.",

As such, their inadvertent presence, though not desirable, was codified as acceptable (21 CFR 630.18(a) and 630.60(c), last promulgated in 1996). Generally, the presence of bacteriophage is taken as a biomarker reflecting a previous level of bioburden in a material, which would have either been controlled (for nonsterile, nonparenteral products) or absent due to sterilization (for most raw materials and for sterile and/or parenteral products).

While it takes experience to recognize the difference between normal cellular structures and those of some viruses, experienced transmission electron microscopists can distinguish between them and thus, identify the presence of viruses. There are limitations to TEM however. It is neither a sensitive nor a specific method. While the latter is to benefit in that a variety of micro-organisms, including viruses, may be detected by this method, nonspecific structures may be mistaken for viruses and viruses can be missed. Furthermore, the sensitivity in terms of limit of detection for this method requires a concentration of virus on the order of 105 or 106 particles/mL. Nonetheless, viral structures can be diagnostic if seen on TEM. So, the look of a virus\u2019 structure by TEM is one means that viruses may be detected.

Thus, as viruses began to be manipulated and studied in the twentieth century, this characteristic was used as a means of assessing for viral infection. The ability of some viruses to adsorb to RBCs, causing clumping or agglutination, was noted in early explorations of viruses. This ability was exploited to develop an early clinical diagnostic test for viruses. These tests, either the hemagglutination of RBCs by supernatants, sera, or plasma containing viruses or the ability of infected cells in culture to hemadsorb RBCs (Shelokov et al. 1958), permit a visualization of viruses by cross-linking viruses and RBCs together in a large enough clump to be observed by the naked eye (hemagglutination) or by light microscopy (hemadsorption).",

Nonetheless, it is a broad general screen requiring little knowledge of the type of virus for which one is looking. Like TEM, it is not specific (bacteria can also hemagglutinate) and in order to visualize the process, a sufficient quantity of virus, viral proteins, or viral particles on the surface of an infected cell must be present to bring together an adequate number of RBCs to clump or hemadsorb and be recognized above background levels. Another caveat is that different viruses will hemagglutinate certain species\u2019 RBCs but not others, so if the wrong species\u2019 RBCs are used, the hemagglutinating effect may be missed. An early study characterized the log10 ratio of infectious influenza virus per hemagglutinating dose to be ~4\u20136 (in other words, 104\u2013106 ID50 per hemagglutinating dose; Donald and Isaacs 1954).",

It is from this provirus that viral mRNA transcripts are generated. Thus, retroviruses must package within their viral capsid a sufficient number of molecules of reverse transcriptase to ensure that this step of the life cycle is completed. Assays are available for detecting this enzymatic activity by monitoring for cDNA molecules thus reverse transcribed.

This method entails the use of PCR to amplify the signal of the reverse transcribed DNA. In the absence of RT enzyme, the RNA template will not be reverse transcribed to DNA and thus, no PCR amplification will occur. But, in its presence, amplicons are generated. This enhances the sensitivity of the method to detect RT by about six orders of magnitude over the conventional method. However, specificity is lost in that host DNA polymerases and authentic reverse transcriptases from host retroelements, present in all eukaryotic species, can also result in a signal in the PERT assay. Means to reduce this background in the assay have been implemented, but it remains a potential area of concern that challenges the conduct and the interpretation of the assay. Also, like all PCRs, test articles may contain nonspecific inhibitors that reduce the sensitivity of the method because they require dilution of the test article to permit the reaction to occur without inhibition.",

Different testing service providers apply differing amounts and even between clients, they may receive different concentrations and volumes of test sample. While the volumes for the in vivo tests are specified, the concentrations of the material applied are not always clear. In FDA regulations that were revoked in 1997 as being obsolete, restrictive, duplicative, or unnecessary,1 the test methods were described in the context of testing of viral harvests of specific vaccines and so dose equivalents were given in terms of viral titers that would reflect a final container dose for that vaccine. The origins of the specific guidelines are very likely rooted in what was considered practical at the time the regulations were first promulgated. Cornfield et al. (1956) described the application of 500 dose equivalents for detecting residual infectious poliovirus after inactivation in order to provide a 1/100,000 chance (after multiple tests at different process stages) that any given dose might contain an infectious unit of poliovirus. Likewise, 500 dose equivalents (or minimum volume of 50 mL, whichever was greater) was promulgated in the 21 CFR-mandated testing for measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines in the 1960s, although the concept was entirely different since these were live vaccines, and the tests were for adventitious agents rather than residual live vaccine virus following inactivation. The similar figure of 500 dose equivalents was not statistically derived, nor is there literature describing the probability of detection of an adventitious agent in a dose of vaccine, as Cornfield et al. did for inactivation of poliovirus. Similar to the revoked U.S. regulations, the European Pharmacopoeia (EP) section 2.6.16 (EP 2014a) specifies testing the greater of 50 mL or 500 dose equivalents for both virus seeds and harvests. However, for testing cells, cell lysates, spent culture fluids, or viral seeds (in the case of the U.S., although this is addressed in the EP as stated above), there was no clear guidance. The FDA guidance document that was finalized and published in 2010, \u201cGuidance for Industry Characterization and Qualification of Cell Substrates and Other Biological Materials Used in the Production of Viral Vaccines for Infectious Disease Indications,\u201d made an effort to add clarity on the recommended amounts to test for these samples (FDA/CBER/OVRR 2010).",

Compounding the lack of validation of certain conventional methods is the variety of cell and animal strains being used, the variety of culture conditions or inoculation and incubation conditions, and lack of widely accepted standards with which to establish performance parameters (for limit tests, primarily sensitivity and specificity).",

For instance, should we worry about plant viruses or most insect viruses (beyond those that cause vector-borne infections in humans)? Arguments about previous exposure to plant viruses via foods are obviously inadequate since many medicines are injected and therefore bypass natural immune mechanisms. Arguments about potential for recombination and unanticipated consequences can seem theoretical at best and quite speculative at worst. If regulators and manufacturers are operating in an information vacuum, it will be difficult for them to say there is no cause for concern. Furthermore, while plant or most insect viruses, for instance, may not seem like safety issues to human recipients or potentially capable of giving rise to emergent human pathogens, they nonetheless remain an impurity concern. They also have the potential to negatively impact the manufacturing consistency of plant- or insect-based production systems, just as MVM or vesivirus 2117 contaminations have negatively impacted manufacturing of CHO cell-derived therapeutic proteins, causing lengthy and costly facility shutdowns and remediation, and even product supply shortages of important medicines. The current suite of tests, with the exception of TEM, are essentially incapable of detecting plant viruses, and many insect viruses would also be missed unless specific PCRs are incorporated. TEM is the notable exception and in fact, an insect virus contaminant that had been observed in a production insect cell line, was detected by careful evaluation of micrographs of an unusually large number of cells than would typically be examined. But, as this would not be done routinely, this approach could not be relied upon for this purpose.",

Major international guidance on viral safety applicable to viral vaccines is available from the US FDA (FDA/CBER/OVRR 2010) and WHO (Petricciani 2010); and from pharmacopeia including the European Pharmacopeia (EP5.2.3 for animal cell substrates, 2.6.16 for viral vaccine seeds and harvests) (EP 2014a, b, respectively), Japanese Pharmacopeia (2011), and likely other similar pharmacopeia from other countries. While the various regulations and guidances are relatively consistent, there are inevitable differences. The extent to which differences are accommodated when new products are registered or existing registrations are updated in different regions is not entirely clear. We cite a few differences here that are relevant to viral safety analytics:EP2.6.16 mandates use of control cells for viral vaccines, whereas FDA and WHO guidances suggest circumstances in which they might be useful, but do not mandate them for all viral vaccines. None of the guidances clarify what is recommended to be done for control cultures of suspension-adapted cell lines used to produce viral vaccines or vectors, or recombinant protein vaccines made in viral-vectored expression systems.WHO guidance and EP2.6.16 specify testing vaccine harvests and seeds for avian viruses using embryonated eggs, only if the vaccine is made in avian cell cultures or eggs, while FDA guidance appears to mandate testing in eggs regardless of the animal cell substrate used for manufacturing. Both EP 2.6.16 and FDA specify a 100-dose equivalent requirement for testing. EP5.2.3 guidance for cell substrates specifies testing any animal cell substrate in embryonated eggs, and there are minor differences in the method description compared with EP.2.6.16.EP5.2.3 and WHO specify 4-week observation of IP-inoculated adult and suckling mice, while EP2.6.16 and FDA specify 21-day observation of IP- and IC-inoculated adult mice (WHO recognizes the IC route in small print). Both FDA and EP2.6.16 specify an initial 2-week observation of suckling mice, but only FDA specifies a blind passage of tissues from surviving mice into another set of suckling mice for an additional 2 weeks (WHO recognizes the FDA option in small print). [The recent work by Gombold et al. 2014, suggests this blind passage does not result in enhancement in sensitivity of the test.]FDA, WHO and EP2.6.16 specify inoculation of guinea pigs (IP all; IC only FDA, but recognized by WHO in small print) followed by observation for 42 days to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis and evidence of LCMV or other viruses. FDA allows for the test for M. tuberculosis to be replaced by validated in vitro culture and PCR methods (WHO allows shortened culture with PCR endpoint). It is unclear if the 42-day test would still be required exclusively to detect LCMV if another test is performed for M. tuberculosis. EP5.2.3 does not specify guinea pig testing.\n",

Rather than spending labor time reviewing the overwhelming proportion of normal (negative) cell sheet surface, labor time could be focused on verification of the much smaller proportion of questionable features in cell monolayers identified through pattern analysis algorithms. But despite progress in imaging, robotics, and analysis, off-the-shelf systems might not currently suffice for broad application in adventitious virus quality control testing. Assembling custom systems that have this capability presents formidable challenges, including but not limited to complexity of automation, rapid acquisition time, depth of field and focus (and thus clarity) in plastic vessels of differing dimensions, image storage and analysis time, and compliance with 21 CFR Part 11 (Code of Federal Regulations 2012b) requirements for computer-based systems. The business case is challenging as well, given the cost and time that would be required for implementation, the variable track record for successful automated image-based applications in quality control, the rapid obsolescence of technologies in the context of license/marketing authorizations in which details of testing are documented, the possibility of only limited reduction in laboratory FTE requirement, and perhaps also the fact that the diagnostic virology community is moving toward more convenient and often nucleic acid-based measures of viral infection.",

However, useful for specific viruses in clinical settings, the promise envisioned in an excellent review (Olivo 1996) has not benefited biopharmaceutical testing. Others have considered recombinant cell lines overexpressing antiapoptotic genes or primary cells treated with apoptosis inhibitors as means of enabling greater viral replication, and thus enhancing the detectability of transforming viruses (Sandstron and Folks 2001 and references therein). Improved sensitivity or breadth could also be accomplished by choice of cell line as well as selection of clones with better assay characteristics. For instance, Gombold et al. (2014) demonstrated differences among cell lines used in conventional assays, suggesting for instance that HeLa and A549 cells were more sensitive than MRC-5 and Vero for adenovirus 41 and rhinovirus, although the A549 cell line was dramatically more sensitive than HeLa for adenovirus type 5. One company serving the diagnostic virology community commercializes prepared cell lines and mixtures of cell lines for more rapid detection of specific categories of viruses.

Furthermore, the cost and complexity of qualifying numerous additional cell lines would represent a barrier to their implementation. Finally, an improved indicator cell line might well be suited to more rapid detection if the virus is present, but the duration needed to confidently call a result negative might not be easily changed from the 28 days now typically required.

Very narrow coverage of a viral gene or genome might be explained by residual nucleic acid, for instance from expression vectors used to make some of the biological reagents used in the method. Coverage of a full viral gene or genome might be consistent with a viral transcript or intact virus. Inferring biological relevance to positive hits depends on the sampling scheme, sample preparation, and suite of controls; often additional and orthogonal methods are needed to evaluate potential positive results. Thus, extensive bioinformatics and virology expertise are needed to process the data.",

If identifications are only accomplished by matching to existing viral databases, however, there is some potential bias contributed by the breadth and depth of the database. Truly novel sequences that do not match well against the existing database might not be recognized as representing a novel virus unless they are assembled without scaffolding against an existing viral reference sequence. Thus, the unbiased potential of next generation sequencing is only realized when the possibility of novel viral sequences in unmatched read population is addressed. The turnaround time, in our experience, for a study from extracted nucleic acids to final analysis has typically been at least several weeks.",

In this case, amplification used an oligonucleotide primer demonstrated to detect a range of viruses (Nanda et al. 2008), and discrete amplification products were isolated from gels, cloned into sequencing vectors, and amplified in bacteria. Identification was accomplished by conventional sequencing. This procedure could be challenging if there were numerous amplification products. Use of next generation sequencing as the readout after degenerate amplification, instead of cloning and conventional sequencing, might be a compelling alternative (McClenahan et al. 2014). Its relative analytical performance in comparison to other broad detection methods needs to be established, and consideration needs to be given toward how a large panel of degenerate primers could be controlled and implemented for regulated testing.",

As a result, study design may be very important for interpretation of signals from molecular-based novel methods.

Understanding the manufacturing process for the vaccine and the various inputs is also critical to evaluating signals\u2014for instance, where process interventions fully inactivate viruses but do not necessarily remove the viral sequences. Interpreting signals across multiple assays (for instance, total RNA as well as viral particle preparations) or even multiple samples can also help reveal viral amplification. For instance, an increase in viral signal with time in culture could strongly suggest productive infection. Positive results in transcriptome studies would be suggestive of infection and gene expression, even if not direct evidence of viral replication (especially in the case of latency transcripts). Mass balance estimates based on input and output copies can be useful for manufacturing cultures exposed to viral sequences and/or particles via raw materials of animal origin.",

As used here, hybrid assays are those in which the test article has been exposed to a conventional or nonconventional analytical cell or animal system in which biological amplification of the agent could occur, and a separate nonconventional readout is applied to detect the agent. A conventional cell culture-based assay might be validated to detect \u201c100\u201d infectious units of a virus (whether defined as TCID50 or PFU). But the readouts typically do not actually detect the initial 100 units, but rather the effects of virus growth started with those 100 infectious units. The biological test system facilitates amplification of the virus inoculum, initially undetectable in the conventional readout, to levels of virus or impact on infected cells that are readily detected by the conventional readout. The same would be true of a novel readout. In fact, detection of the increase in genome copies of porcine circovirus 1, which did not generate CPE, was key to its detection in an infectivity assay (presentation by Krause, http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/BloodVaccinesandOtherBiologics/VaccinesandRelatedBiologicalProductsAdvisoryCommittee/ucm211828.htm Accessed 13 Feb 2014).

By viral safety margin, we mean the excess capacity of a process for assuring any potential contaminant is removed, inactivated, or simply not present beyond what was present originally (if any). Considering viral clearance validation as an example, if an endogenous viral contaminant is present at such a level that virtually every dose of vaccine produced could contain particles, then viral clearance would be necessary to clear the virus particles to a level that establishes that statistically only a vanishingly small number of doses could potentially be contaminated in a whole lot. Often the regulatory expectation is that this margin-of-safety reduces the probability to less than 1 in a million doses being likely to contain a particle, for instance, in the illustration provided in ICH Q5A (ICH 1999). This excess capacity of a process to clear viruses that might be present (e.g., of residual live virus in the case of inactivated viral vaccines or of endogenous viral particles in the case of recombinant vaccines made in rodent cells) is the viral safety margin. Viral clearance validation or validation of inactivation procedures for inactivated vaccines are intended to establish such viral safety margins. We find this concept useful in thinking about the needed sensitivity of viral detection methods to ensure freedom from adventitious agents and consider whether conventional or novel methods can attain such, as discussed below.",

An intermediate value in the calculation, infectious units/mL of culture, could be compared with the known sensitivities of the conventional detection method as well as the novel method, allowing some visibility into whether the limits of detection or breadth of detection of either analytical method really provides a meaningful viral safety limit compared with that contributed by the manufacturing process and controls. The challenges with such a modeling approach become obvious\u2014many values are required for which solid experimental data may not be available. Clearly, recalibration would be necessary, requiring another assumption, to convert from infectious units to viral genome copy equivalents to enable these comparisons.

The more tests that are run, the more likely that a false positive result will be observed, if each test is validated to a confidence level of 95 % (i.e., then statistically 5 % of tests could be falsely positive by chance). And finally, and importantly, discordant results on tests that measure the same parameter (i.e., detection of viral contaminants) could become a QA/QC quagmire. Manufacturers would need to prospectively determine an algorithm not only for validity criteria within a single test, but also for which test to \u201cbelieve\u201d or what testing strategy would need to be undertaken to resolve the matter in the case of discordant results between tests for the same measure.

We assert that testing for adventitious agents should not be the sole basis on which product biosafety is assured. Appropriate sourcing and quality control of raw and starting materials, adherence to principles of Good Manufacturing Practices, including environmental and personnel monitoring and process validation, and finally, testing as verification are the package needed for maximal assurance of biosafety. Thus, a pathway forward to a new paradigm for adventitious agent testing exists in which detection of a broader array of potential adventitious agents might be included in the testing, with adequate sensitivity to provide the needed assurance of verification that there has been no catastrophic breach, in the context of the overall process, design, and adherence to cGMP.
