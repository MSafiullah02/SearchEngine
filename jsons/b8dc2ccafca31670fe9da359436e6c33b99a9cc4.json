            "text": "Motor inhibition is a key control mechanism that allows humans to rapidly adapt their actions in response to environmental events. One of the hallmark signatures of rapidly exerted, reactive motor inhibition is the non-selective suppression of cortico-spinal excitability (CSE): unexpected sensory stimuli lead to a suppression of CSE across the entire motor system, even in muscles that are inactive. Theories suggest that this reflects a fast, automatic, and broad engagement of inhibitory control, which facilitates behavioral adaptations to unexpected changes in the sensory environment. However, it is an open question whether such non-selective CSE suppression is truly due to the unexpected nature of the sensory event, or whether it is sufficient for an event to be merely infrequent (but not unexpected). Here, we report data from two experiments in which human subjects experienced both unexpected and expected infrequent events during a simple reaction time task while CSE was measured from a task-unrelated muscle. We found that expected infrequent events can indeed produce non-selective CSE suppression -but only when they occur during movement initiation. In contrast, unexpected infrequent events produce non-selective CSE suppression even in the absence of movement initiation. Moreover, CSE suppression due to unexpected events occurs at shorter latencies compared to expected infrequent events. These findings demonstrate that unexpectedness and stimulus infrequency have qualitatively different suppressive effects on the motor system. They also have key implications for studies that seek to disentangle neural and psychological processes related to motor inhibition and stimulus detection.",

            "text": "The rapid interruption of active motor representations allows humans to momentarily cancel ongoing movements and movement plans, which in turn allows them to reevaluate whether those movements are still appropriate when environmental circumstances suddenly change. In the laboratory, motor inhibition is usually assessed in tasks like the stop-signal task (Logan, Cowan, and Davis, 1984) , where it allows humans to rapidly stop actions even after their initiation. In such tasks, subjects are explicitly instructed to stop an action following a previously instructed infrequent signal, which follows the response prompt on a minority of trials (Verbruggen et al., 2019) . Because subjects in tasks like the stop-signal task expect that these infrequent stop-signals will occur on a subset of trials, successful action-stopping in such tasks results from the implementation of both proactive and reactive inhibitory control mechanisms (Aron, 2011 , Kenemans, 2015 . Proactive inhibition denotes the anticipatory implementation of control processes during the expectation of a stop-signal, while reactive inhibition denotes the cascade of processes that is triggered by the stop-signal itself (Verbruggen et al., 2009; Chikazoe et al., 2009; Jaffard et al., 2008) .",

By applying single-pulses of TMS to the contralateral motor cortex representation of a specific muscle, a motor evoked potential is produced in the electromyogram of that muscle. The amplitude of this motor evoked potential provides a proxy for the net-CSE of the underlying corticomotor tract.

Specifically, we propose that the purpose of this automatically engaged inhibitory control effort is to rapidly interrupt ongoing behavior, which purchases time for the cognitive system to resolve the surprise produced by the 7 unexpected event. This additional processing time can be used to evaluate whether ongoing motor plans are still appropriate in light of the sudden unexpected change in environmental regularity (Wessel & Aron, 2017) .",

Therefore, it is possible that the infrequency of a stimulus alone can account for the presence of non-selective CSE suppression after both stop-signals and unexpected events. If that is the case, surprise itself is not necessary to explain the presence of non-selective CSE suppression, and may in fact not uniquely engage motor inhibition at all. Indeed, while surprise and infrequency are often confounded, they are meaningfully different cognitive constructs. For example, infrequent events can be entirely expected (hearing a fire alarm during an announced drill), or entirely unexpected (hearing the same fire alarm on a regular day), with fundamentally different cognitive and behavioral implications.",

Indeed, if expected infrequent events can -by themselves -recruit reactive motor inhibition, this would be highly relevant for the study of motor inhibition in the stop-signal task. In fact, one of the most controversial questions in the recent stopsignal literature is which exact neural or psychological processes following stop-signals are related to the attentional detection of the infrequent stop-signal itself, and which are related to the actual implementation of motor inhibition (Verbruggen et al., 2010; Hampshire et al., 2010; Matzke et al., 2013) . To address this question, many studies have utilized control tasks whose stimulus layout matches the stop-signal task (i.e., a go-signal is followed by an infrequent second signal) but with an instruction that does not involve outright action stopping (e.g., to press a second button after the original go-response or to ignore the second signal entirely, Hampshire et al., 2010; Dodds et al., 2011; Chatham et al., 2012; Erika-Florence et al., 2014; Waller et al., 2019) . If such expected infrequent stimuli presented outside of a stop-signal task produced the same type of reactive, nonselective motor inhibition that is found after unexpected infrequent stimuli, it would invalidate the assumption that a contrast between a stop-signal and an infrequent-signal control task would isolate the inhibitory process that is found in the stop-signal task.",

At the beginning of every trial, a black fixation cross was displayed in the center of a gray screen background. After 500ms, a sound stimulus was played for 200ms, which could be of one of the following conditions: STANDARD (frequent), EXPECTED (infrequent), UNEXPECTED (infrequent). The STANDARD and EXPECTED sounds were sine wave tones of either 600 or 800Hz frequency, counterbalanced across participants. The participant was introduced to the STANDARD and EXPECTED sounds in a practice block prior to the recorded experiment. In the practice block, the EXPECTED sound occurred during 20% of trials, with the remainder being STANDARD sounds. In the actual experiment, the EXPECTED sound occurred on 10% of trials. The UNEXPECTED sounds occurred on 10% of trials and were only introduced during the main experiment, without prior instruction. These novel sounds were 90 bird song samples from European starlings (recorded by Jordan A. Comins), which were matched in amplitude envelope and duration to the sine wave tones. After the sound, on each trial, a single pulse of TMS was delivered with a delay of 125, 150, or 175ms (i.e., centered around 150ms, which was the time point at which the CSE suppression after unexpected sounds was observed in Wessel & Aron, 2013) . Subjects were instructed that the sound would cue them to the timing of the appearance of the imperative stimulus. The imperative stimulus was a black arrow pointing left or pointing right, and appeared 500ms after the onset of the sound.",

            "text": "Across two experiments, we investigated whether infrequent but expected events induce a non-selective suppression of the motor system, similarly to unexpected events and stop-signals. Using single-pulse TMS combined with EMG of task-unrelated hand muscles while participants performed forced-choice reaction time tasks with their feet, we found that infrequent expected sounds are indeed followed by a non-selective suppression of task-unrelated motor effectors. However, we found that this is only the case when a movement is currently being initiated (i.e., when the infrequent event follows the imperative stimulus that instructs a movement). In contrast, unexpected infrequent events non-selectively suppress CSE even in the absence of movement initiation (i.e., when presented before any imperative stimulus). The latter finding replicates our previous report of non-selective CSE suppression in a verbal reaction time task when unexpected sounds were presented prior to the imperative stimulus (Wessel & Aron, 2013) . Notably, the timing of the non-selective suppression of CSE after unexpected infrequent events was in line with our prior work, in that it takes place at 150ms following the onset of the sound (Wessel & Aron, 2013; Dutra et al., 2018) . In turn, it is notable that non-selective CSE suppression after expected infrequent events did not occur until 175ms after the event. These findings have two primary implications, which we will now discuss in turn.",

In that respect, it is interesting to observe that the respective suppressive effects of expected and unexpected infrequent events do not seem to be additive. This is evident from the fact that while expected infrequent sounds produced CSE suppression at 175ms following sound onset in Experiment 2, no suppression was observed at that time point for unexpected sounds (which showed CSE suppression at 150ms instead). If the effects of surprise and infrequency were additive, unexpected sounds should have produced suppression at both 150ms (due to the unexpectedness) and at 175ms (due to the infrequency). Instead, infrequency and unexpectedness appear to independently engage the same inhibitory process, but with different intensity and latency. This supports the theory that surprise is accompanied by a unique pattern of automatically engaged inhibitory control (Wessel & Aron, 2017) .",

            "text": "Beyond these implications for the processing of unexpected and infrequent events, the current findings also have very important implications for the study of motor inhibition in the context of the stop-signal task. As mentioned in the introduction, recent years have seen a controversial discussion regarding the exact psychological and neural mechanisms that contribute to performance in the stop-signal task. Specifically, the notion that the ability to stop an action is not solely dependent on the efficacy of the inhibitory process itself, but also depends on the initial attentional detection of the (infrequent) stopsignal and the associated triggering of the inhibitory process has been particularly prominent (Levy & Wagner, 2011; Verbruggen et al., 2014; Erika-Florence et al., 2014; Matzke et al., 2013 Matzke et al., , 2017 . This notion has spurred a fundamental discussion about which parts of the neural cascade of activity following stop-signals reflect the attentional detection of an infrequent instructed signal to stop, and which reflect the motor inhibition process itself (Aron et al., 2014; Hampshire & Sharp, 2015; Swick & Chatham, 2014) . In many studies that address this question, an inferential contrast is used in which brain activity following stop-signals is compared to brain activity following perceptually identical, infrequent, expected events that do not convey a 'stopping' instruction (Schmajuk et al., 2006; Dimoska & Johnstone, 2008; Hampshire et al., 2010; Boehler et al., 2010; Tabu et al., 2011; Dodds et al., 2011; Chatham et al., 2012; Erika-Florence et al., 2014; Bissett & Logan, 2014; Elchlepp et al., 2015; Lawrence et al., 2015; Verbruggen et al., 2010; Waller, Hazeltine, and Wessel, 2019) . In other words, those studies employ a purportedly 'noninhibitory' control condition that resembles the design of our current Experiment 2, where a go-signal is followed by an infrequent expected event. The current results clearly show that presenting such infrequent, expected events after go-signals lead to an automatic engagement of non-selective motor inhibition. This is in line with our other recent work, which has shown that expected infrequent events after a go-signal lead to an incidental slowing of reaction times and elicit neural activity from the same neural generator that is engaged by stop-signals . Taken together, this suggests that the 'inhibition-free' control conditions that are used in studies to isolate attentional from inhibitory processes are not, in fact, free of inhibitory activity. Hence, a subtractive contrast between stop-trials and such control conditions will likely cancel out (at least parts of) the inhibitory process, instead of isolating it. Therefore, these subtractive contrasts might operationalize other condition differences between stop-trials and control trials with infrequent signals (such as the fact that stop-trials do not include a motor response).",

            "text": "Nevertheless, this hypothesis would necessitate independent validation. Finally, the differential timing of CSE suppression found for unexpected and expected infrequent events provides some interesting aspects for future study. There are several potential explanations for this difference in timing. It is widely believed that nonselective CSE suppression is due to the engagement of a specific fronto-basal ganglia inhibitory pathway (Aron, 2011; Jahanshahi et al., 2015; Neubart et al., 2010; Wiecki & Frank 2013; Wessel et al., 2016; Wessel & Aron, 2017; Kelley et al., 2018; Wessel et al., 2019) . It is unclear whether the timing difference between unexpected and expected infrequent events found here is due to differences in subcortical processing in the basal ganglia, or because of differences in the cortical processes that trigger the basal ganglia processes. One property of this proposed fronto-basal ganglia pathway underlying nonselective CSE suppression is its ostensible hyper-direct, mono-synaptic connection from the cortical areas that trigger the inhibitory process into the basal ganglia structures that implement the actual inhibition (Nambu et al., 2002; Parent and Hazrati, 1995; Chen et al., 2020) . If this circuit is indeed as hard-wired and low-level as believed, differences in cortical processing related to the triggering of the inhibitory process are perhaps more likely to account for the differences in timing of the CSE suppression between expected and unexpected infrequent events. Indeed, classic EEG studies of such events do indicate that while unexpected infrequent events evoke a fronto-central P3a waveform, expected frequent events evoke a slower-latency, more posterior P3b (Courchesne et al., 1975; Friedman et al., 2001; Comerchero & Polich, 1999) , which would suggest differences in cortical processing. Future studies could test whether both of these potentials reflect the activity of different cortical pathways that detect unexpected and expected infrequent events, respectively, but ultimately both produce inhibition mediated via the same basal ganglia circuit.",

However, this suppression of the motor system is qualitatively different than the suppression observed after unexpected events (which manifests with lower latency and is also observable in the absence of motor preparation). The presence of this frequency-related inhibitory effect poses an important challenge for studies of motor inhibition that seek to produce conditions that do not include inhibitory activity. Finally, the current results show that 23 surprise caused by unexpectedness has unique effects on the motor system that are not attributable to the relative frequency of an event alone.",

Follow-up pairwise t-tests revealed that UNEXPECTED MEPs were suppressed compared to STANDARD MEPs at the 150ms delay (t(20) = 3.40, p = .003, d = .40), replicating our previous findings. In addition, the EXPECTED MEP was suppressed compared to the STANDARD trial MEP at the 175ms delay (t(20) = 2.99, p = .007, d = .39,Figure 2). Moreover, at the same delay, the MEP following UNEXPECTED sounds was elevated compared to STANDARD trials (t(20) = 2.53, p = .02, d = .23), though unlike the above effects, this does not survive the Bonferroni-Holm correction for multiple comparisons.",
