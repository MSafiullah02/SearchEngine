To address the pathogenic challenges to the human health, researchers developed various vaccines and antibiotics during the twentieth century. A worldwide usage of such therapeutic strategies led to the expansion of structural as well as behavioral properties in various bacterial species. Diverse defense mechanisms were acquired by the known bacterial species that resulted in antibiotic tolerance or drug resistance, currently a major concern during administration of known antibiotics in pathogenic conditions. Lord Jim O'Neil and his team estimated that antimicrobial resistance could cause 10 million deaths a year by 2050 (1).",

Even among the existing vaccines, BCG which is heavily used vaccine against tuberculosis, is less effective in the immunocompromised and adults in tropical and subtropical region (3) and its efficacy is rapidly decreasing (4). Anthrax, DPT, Hib, Meningococcal vaccine, Pneumococcus heptavalent conjugate polysaccharide vaccine (PCV7), Pneumococcus 13-valent conjugate polysaccharide vaccine (PCV13) etc are generally considered effective at controlling disease symptoms. However, a major concern of recent vaccination programs tends to be the preference of vaccine escape mutants, i.e., the repertoire of immune targets in the pathogen is different from that used in the vaccine formulation (5). Antigenic variation and continuous bacterial evolution has necessitated designing of better vaccine candidates.",

It is a well-known fact that, diverse bacterial species and strains have evolved multiple mechanisms for evading the host immune responses, not only by producing likes of host inhibition pathway receptor ligands (\u201cmolecular mimicry\u201d) but also by producing virulence factors resembling the intermediates of the host inhibitory pathways. Hence, peptides found in proteomes of the 1000 human genomes were removed while implementing the pipeline.

Several anti-bacterial peptides have been studied to check the pestiferous effects of pathogenic bacteria (35, 36). Rapid bacteriocidal activity and low propensity for resistance development are some of the major assets of these peptides, but high cost, limited stability and unknown toxicology, and pharmacokinetics are the major disadvantages (37). Contrary to antibiotics or peptide-based drugs, instigating host immune responses against the pathogen offers multifaceted management of the invasion and has been successfully achieved in the past by the use of vaccines like DPT, BCG etc against few deadly infectious diseases like tenaus, diptheria, tuberculosis etc. Consequently, active search for vaccines is underway currently for many infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria, for example, melioidosis caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei (2). Even in case of tuberculosis, for which multiple lines of drugs and BCG vaccines are available; reduced efficacy of BCG and antibiotic resistance forced investigation of better and more potent vaccines. A recent computational effort has gone up to the strain level comparison and considered proteins as vaccine targets that were shared among tuberculoid, non-tuberculoid, and vaccine strains (16). Continuous efforts are being made by researchers to identify novel vaccine candidates against several pathogens such as Ebola virus (14), Zika virus (15), vaccinia virus (38), Neisseria meningitidis (39), Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (40) Edwardsiella tarda, and Flavobacterium columnare; fish pathogens (41, 42).",

In this study, we employed immunoinformatic tools to identify antigen and epitope-based vaccine candidates, having the potential to evoke one of the many arms of immune system. The present study includes proteins; virulence factors as well as proteins encoded by genes essential for survival from multiple pathogenic bacteria. The pipeline created for the identification of vaccine candidates, consists of widely used, accurate and recommended tools (12, 13). Our pipeline also includes a tool to identify peptide-based adjuvant candidates, a major advantage over other studies. The numbers of epitopes predicted by the individual tools within the pipeline that are not present in the proteome derived from the 1000 human genomes, were in thousands. For arriving at economical number of epitopes that could be tested experimentally, an intuitive rational criterion was to extract epitopes predicted positive by more than one tool in the pipeline. This would effectively mean that the selected epitope could have a predictive capability of evoking different arms of the immune system.",

Similarly, 420 membrane proteins from the DEG provided 1307 predicted T-cell epitopes and 155 predicted B-cell epitopes that are also MHC II binders and adjuvants. The 36 DEG envelope proteins when subjected to the epitope prediction pipeline, yield 104 predicted T-cell epitopes and 20 predicted B-cell epitopes with probability that these will bind MHC Class II molecules and would also be adjuvants. In cases of 52 secretory proteins and 38 repair proteins taken from the DEG, the predicted T-cell epitopes, and B-cell epitopes were respectively 173 and 23 for secretory proteins and 138 and 44 for the repair proteins, all of them being also the positively predicted MHC II binders as well as adjuvants.",

They need potent immunostimulatory adjuvants to effectively activate the innate and adaptive arms of immune system. In this study, we have implemented VaxinPAD in our prediction pipeline, which aids in predicting based vaccine adjuvant, thus strengthening the study. Beside this, peptide formulation is a critical task and a formulation scientist must overcome the chemical instability of peptides. The conformational fluxionality and propensity to self-associate makes peptide more difficult to formulate. Various computational tools predict the aggregation propensities of polypeptide chains such as Zyggregator (44), PASTA 2.0 (45), etc. These can be used prior to formulating the peptide-based vaccine. THPdb is a database of FDA approved protein and peptide therapeutics, and provide detailed formulation strategies of peptide-based drug available in the market (46). Although little literature exist about formulating peptide drug product but strategies used in successful peptide drugs will be helpful in designing newer formulation techniques and constituent for peptide based vaccines.",

Thus, the antigen or epitope should be experimentally validated before suggesting it for medical purpose. Apart from this, the platform, VacTarBac, would require continuous revamp owing to the rapidly growing sequencing data particularly that of the novel and emerging pathogenic strains. A future work for this platform may include comparison of the pathogenic proteomes at the strain level. This may lead to identification of recently acquired proteins/peptides of the pathogen that may have rendered existing therapeutic strategies against the emergent strain ineffective. Moreover, the platform, VacTarBac, still lacks information of vaccine formulations that may be added in future to help in the actual development of the vaccines. Despite such limitations, we anticipate that the current study and the current data in the repository VacTarBac, will be helpful for researchers and will boost and hasten the vaccine designing against pathogenic bacteria considered in the study.",
