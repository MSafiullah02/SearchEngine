For example, the mode of interaction between the V H and V L chains, and thus the relative position of the complementarity-determining regions, can affect the specificity and affinity of the CAR for its target antigen 19 . Importantly, scFv affinity for the target antigen is a fundamental determinant of CAR function and should be high enough to effectively recognize tumour cells and induce CAR signalling and T cell activation; however, excessively high affinity can lead to activation-induced cell death (AICD) of the CAR-expressing cell and, potentially, toxicities [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Adding to the complexity of CAR design, the use of different scFvs with similar affinities for the same target protein can have dissimilar effects on CAR T cell function 18 . Target antigen density and epitope location are also crucial factors to consider in identifying an ideal scFv for CAR engineering in order to optimize binding of the CAR to its target. Finally, certain scFvs are associated with ligand-independent tonic signalling, which has been shown reduce the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in preclinical models by leading to terminal effector T cell differentiation, exhaustion and/or AICD 17, 26 .",

The vast majority of CARs activate CAR T cells via CD3\u03b6derived immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. However, signalling mediated by these motifs alone is insufficient to induce productive T cell responses and results in limited in vivo T cell persistence and activity 48 ; a co-stimulatory signal is necessary for optimal T cell function, metabolism and persistence. T cells with CARs containing co-stimulatory domains in addition to activation domains produce IL-2 and can proliferate upon repeated antigen exposure 49 . The most widely studied co-stimulatory domains are derived from CD28 or 4-1BB (CD137), and CAR T cell products utilizing either of these domains are FDA approved 6, 7 . CD28-domain CAR T cells and 4-1BB-domain CAR T cells are both associated with high response rates in patients but have different functional and metabolic profiles 50 . T cells expressing CARs with CD28 domains differentiate into effector memory T cells and predominantly utilize aerobic glycolysis, whereas 4-1BB-containing CAR T cells differentiate into central memory T (T CM ) cells and have increased mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism 51 . T cells with CARs containing alternative co-stimulatory domains have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models but have not yet been tested in patients. These domains include those derived from MYD88 and CD40 (reF. 52 ), OX40 (CD134) 53, 54 , inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS) 55 , CD27 (reFs 56, 57 ) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 2DS2 (KIR2DS2; combined with co-expression of TYRO protein tyrosine kinase-binding protein, also known as DAP12) 58 . Building on the four modular components of CARs and informed by the success and failures of CAR T cells in clinical studies, investigators are innovatively engineering CAR T cells in a variety of ways. These strategies aim to improve the safety and efficacy of CAR T cell therapies, broaden the range of cancers amenable to such treatments and facilitate more rapid, reliable and efficient production of these agents. The antigen-binding domain is usually a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) molecule derived from a monoclonal antibody (mAb; from mouse anti-human CD19 antibodies, for example, in the currently FDA-approved CAR T cell products). The intracellular signalling domain generally contains a T cell activation domain derived from the CD3\u03b6 chain of the T cell receptor as well as co-stimulatory domains that often comprise immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing regions of CD28 or 4-1BB (also known as CD137 and TNFRSF9). CAR gene constructs can be further modified to engineer CAR T cells with expression of an 'armour' protein, which is typically a cell-surface or secreted immunomodulatory molecule that enhances T cell function or favourably modifies the tumour microenvironment. Variation of each of these component parts of CAR constructs enables fine tuning of the functionality and antitumour activity of the resultant CAR T cell product, and CARs with various designs are being developed to improve the safety and efficacy of these therapies across various cancers. In addition, gene editing of the engineered T cells to further enhance CAR T cell function is a promising avenue of research in this area.

CRS is characterized by increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, fever, hypotension, hypoxia and organ dysfunction and is often responsive to treatment with the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab, the anti-IL-6 antibody siltuximab or corticosteroids. CAR T cell-induced HLH/MAS is a rare and more severe systemic hyperinflammatory syn drome diagnosed based on manifest symptoms of CRS and combinations of elevated serum levels of ferritin and liver enzymes, haemophagocytosis, cytopenias, renal failure, pulmonary oedema, splenomegaly and/or an absence of NK cell activity. CAR T cell-related HLH/MAS can be refractory to targeted inhibition of the IL-6 pathway and might require the use of chemotherapy (systemic etoposide or, in the context of HLH-associated neurotoxicity, intrathecal cytarabine), extrapolating from the management paradigms of non-CAR-related refractory HLH 2 .",

In this system, a protease target site and protease are embedded in the CAR construct, together with a 'degron' moiety that promotes degradation of the CAR protein. In the 'on' state, the target site is cleaved, resulting in removal of the degron from the CAR protein, and thus the CAR is expressed on the surface of the T cells; however, upon administration of an exogenous smallmolecule protease inhibitor, the CAR protein is not cleaved, resulting in retention of the degron and CAR degradation via the proteolytic pathway.",

Accordingly, dasatinib rapidly and reversibly prevented CAR T cell activation and, when administered shortly (3 hours) after cell infusion, markedly reduced mortality from CAR T cell-induced CRS in a mouse model of lymphoma 82 .

This widely observed toxicity of anti-CD19 CAR T cells is well tolerated and treatable with periodic infusions of intravenous immuno globulins to replace antibodies that would otherwise have been produced by the patient's B cells. The potential for less tolerable on-target, off-tumour toxicities with agents targeting other candidate TAAs limits the clinical use of many CAR T cell products. In a clinical trial of a carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)-targeted CAR T cell product involving patients with renal cell carcinoma, multiple patients developed liver enzyme abnormalities 84 . These adverse effects were attributed to CAR T cell infiltration into the CAIX-expressing bile duct epithelium and were prevented in subsequent patients through the administration of an antagonistic anti-CAIX monoclonal antibody 84 , providing strong evidence of on-target, off-tumour toxicities. Much more alarmingly, a patient receiving HER2-directed CAR T cell therapy for metastatic colon cancer developed respiratory distress and pulmonary oedema 15 minutes after cell infusion, which progressed to multiorgan failure and death 85 . The mechanism of this toxicity was speculated to be mediated by recognition of HER2 in non-malignant lung tissue by CAR T cells, triggering a systemic cytokine storm 85 . Of note, HER2 is expressed at low levels in many nonmalignant tissues, and the antibody trastuzumab, on which the CAR was based, has known on-target, offtumour effects 86 .

Less severe pulmonary toxicities have also been observed in a trial of CAR T cells targeting carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5), specifically in all of four patients who received a high CAR T cell dose (a total of 0.33-3.89 \u00d7 10 9 viable cells) and intensive preconditioning with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine 89 . These toxicities were hypothesized to be attributable to interactions between CAR T cells and non-malignant CEACAM5-expressing cells in the lung; however, no definitive evidence of such interactions was established and no gastrointestinal toxicities were observed 89 , despite the known expression of CEACAM5 in the gastrointestinal tract. Considering the variations in co-stimulatory domains, conditioning regimens, cytokine administration and CAR T cell dosing used in these studies, and that some of these toxicities are hard to distinguish from general cytokine-related toxicities, establishing whether the clinical complications reflect on-target, off-tumour effects is difficult. Nonetheless, technologies designed to limit on-target, off-tumour toxicities could provide opportunities to generate more clinically effective CAR therapies, and numerous approaches are currently in development 90 . These strategies are predicated on the targeting of antigens more specific to the tumour, optimizing the interaction of CARs with cancer cells relative to non-malignant cells ( Fig. 3Aa-d) , introducing the requirement for multiple antigens or the absence of a specific antigen (logic-gated CARs) (Fig. 3Ba) and/or limiting the spatial and temporal activity of CARs (Fig. 3Bb ).",

Antigens expressed at higher levels on tumour cells than on non-malignant cells could potentially be targeted using lower-affinity scFv CARs, thereby ensuring that only the tumour cells with a high antigen density can provide interactions of sufficiently high avidity to activate CAR T cells. The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated in preclinical models, across a range of different antigens, although downregulation of the target antigen has been identified as a mechanism of resistance 23, 91, 92 . In one preclinical study in which the affinity of a ganglioside GD2-targeted CAR was dramatically increased through a single amino acid substitution in the antigen-binding domain 93 , mice developed fatal encephalitis attributed to the interaction of CAR T cells with GD2 + cerebellar tissue that has not been observed with the lower-affinity GD2 CAR in preclinical models or clinical trials. This finding illustrates the profound effects that subtle changes in the scFv can have on the therapeutic window of CAR T cells.",

The synNotch system 94 involves the use of a synthetic Notch receptor engineered to recognize one TAA, activation of which induces the expression of a second construct encoding a CAR specific to a second TAA and containing T cell activation domains -thus creating an \"AND\" logic gate requiring the simultaneous presence of two cell-surface antigens for CAR T cell activation (Fig. 3Ba) . This system has been used to target tumour cells expressing the antigen ROR1 (reF. 95 ), which is also present on essential bone marrow stromal cells and in other tissues; gating for expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) or B7-H3 as secondary antigens was demonstrated to increase the tumour-cell specificity and reduce the risk of toxicities in animal models, compared with traditional CAR T cells targeting ROR1 alone 95 . However, the slow activation kinetics of such logic-gated CAR T cells might limit the efficacy of this approach. A similar logic-gating effect can be achieved by linking the CD3\u03b6 and co-stimulatory domains to separate receptors, each recognizing different antigens (thus utilizing a first-generation CAR construct in combination with a chimeric co-stimulatory receptor) (Fig. 3Aa) . The promise of this approach has been demonstrated in preclinical models of prostate cancer 96 , breast cancer 97 and other experimental systems 98 . An analogous approach involves the use of secondary chimeric cytokine receptors for tumour cell-derived cytokines, such as IL-4, to restrict T cell activity to tumour tissue 90, 99 (Fig. 3Ad) , although with the drawback that these inflammatory cytokines are not strictly tumour specific. A related strategy is predicated on the use of inhibitory CARs, which are engineered to inhibit T cell activation upon binding to an antigen expressed on non-malignant cells but not tumour cells, thus ensuring that productive signalling by a co-expressed activatory CAR only occurs in tumours. Instead of co-stimulatory domains, the inhibitory CARs contain inhibitory domains derived from immune-checkpoint proteins, such as cytotoxic lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA-4) or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), thereby co-opting the intrinsic immune-checkpoint signalling pathways of T cells 100 (Fig. 3Ab) .",

For example, \u03b3\u03b4T cells are a T cell subset that have an innate tumoursensing capacity by virtue of expression of TCRs with \u03b3\u03b4 subunits (rather than the more common \u03b1\u03b2 subunits), which recognize phosphoantigens that are characteristic of tumour cells with dysregulated metabolism 105 (Fig. 3Ac) . Transduction of \u03b3\u03b4T cells with a GD2-targeted CAR harbouring only a co-stimulatory domain resulted in cytolytic responses against GD2 + neuroblastoma cells but not GD2 + non-malignant tissues in vitro (because the CD3\u03b6 signal was only provided by tumour cells that engaged the endogenous \u03b3\u03b4TCR), illustrating the potentially improved safety profile of this approach 106 . One particularly creative and ambitious approach to reducing on-target, off-tumour toxicities is to genetically modify the non-malignant tissues to remove the target antigen. CAR T cell treatment for AML is limited by the lack of known cell-surface protein antigens expressed on the cancer cells that are not also present on essential neutrophils and/or essential haematopoietic progenitor cells. Kim et al. 107 circumvented this barrier by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) (CRISPR-Cas9) genome-editing system to knockout the seemingly non-essential CD33 surface marker in non-malignant haematopoietic progenitor cells. When anti-CD33 CAR T cells were subsequently administered to mice with CD33 + AML, the modified CD33non-malignant bone marrow and myeloid cells were not targeted. The investigators of this study noted that they are planning a clinical trial designed to investigate this approach 107 .",

Furthermore, infusion of CAR T cells into patients at a defined 1:1 CD4 + to CD8 + T cell ratio has been shown to result in cell dose-related increases in CAR T cell expansion and fewer toxicities 121, 122 . Trials designed to test CAR T cell products selectively generated from CD8 + T CM cells are currently underway (NCT01087294) 123 . Co-stimulation is a vital part of effective CAR T cell function, but excess co-stimulatory signalling might decrease the persistence of CAR T cells in patients. Thus, engineering strategies are being developed to address this issue, including altering the co-stimulatory domain of the CAR to decrease the intensity of the signal, for example, by mutating some of the immuno receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs within the CD28 domain [124] [125] [126] . Modulation of the co-stimulatory signal can also be achieved through co-expression of ligands for auto-stimulation and trans-stimulation of CAR T cells. For example, seeking to combine the rapid activatory kinetics afforded by the CD28 co-stimulatory domains and the better persistence associated with the 4-1BB domain, Zhao et al. 127 demonstrated that co-expression of 4-1BBL on CAR T cells with CD28 co-stimulatory domains results in armoured CAR T cells with a longer duration of persistence, decreased expression of exhaustion markers and a high CD8 + to CD4 + T cell ratio compared with CAR T cells expressing only CD28-based or 4-1BB-based CARs (Fig. 4Bb) . These 4-1BBL-expressing CAR T cells are currently being tested in clinical trials in patients with relapsed CD19 + haematological malignancies (NCT03085173) 128 .",

The disappointing results in patients with solid tumours can be attributed to several factors; the lack of suitable tumour-specific antigens -or TAAs with expression profiles that are likely to be associated with tolerable on-target, off-tumour toxicities -is an obvious barrier to effective CAR T cell therapy for solid tumours. Nevertheless, the collective lack of efficacy observed with diverse CAR T cell products targeting several different solid tumour antigens suggests the existence of general barriers that could potentially be surmounted with additional CAR T cell engineering. The complicated structure and cellular milieu of solid tumours influences both tumour biology and response to therapy 130 . Solid tumours reside in tissues with lower numbers of endogenous T cells than lymphoid tissues and perhaps also lower levels of homeostatic cyto kines and other T cell-supportive factors normally derived from the bone marrow and lymph node stroma. The structure of the solid tumour stroma can pose a physical barrier to CAR T cell penetration. In addition, suppressive immune cells, such as regulatory T (T reg ) cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and immunosuppressive ligands, such as programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), present in the TME might all quell intrinsic antitumour immune responses as well as CAR T cell responses.",

Several technologies have been developed to create universal CARs for which adapter elements are used as ligands to enable the targeting of multiple antigens with a single CAR T cell population (Fig. 4Ac) . For example, avidin-linked CARs (named biotin-binding immune receptors) in combination with biotinylated antibodies can be used not only to control CAR T cell activity similar to a safety switch but also to target multiple antigens, either sequentially or simultaneously 132, 133 . Similar approaches involve the use of CARs with scFvs that recognize a fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorophore conjugated to TAA-binding molecules in order to target multiple antigens simultaneously [134] [135] [136] [137] . Likewise, CARs that incorporate Fc\u03b3Rs as the antigen-binding domain enable the use of therapeutic TAA-binding antibodies to target multiple antigens with a single CAR molecule 138 . In the SUPRA (split, universal and programmable) CAR system 139 , leucine zipper motifs are used to match CARs (zipCAR) with free scFvs (zipFv), again enabling simultaneous targeting of multiple antigens as well as the inclusion of multiple antigen logic gates and attenuation of CAR T cell activation (the CAR T cells are only active when zipFv are present). These and other technologies might provide a means to successfully target heterogeneous solid tumours in patients while minimizing off-tumour toxicities.",

Several innovative engineering strategies have been used to enhance the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. A | CAR T cell products designed to target multiple different tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) (a) can overcome antigen escape or heterogeneity; variations on this approach are predicated on the use of CAR T cells engineered to co-express and secrete bi-specific T cell engagers (BiTEs) (b) or the use of CARs targeting adapter molecules that can be linked to a range of soluble antigen-recognition moieties to enable simultaneous recognition of multiple antigens with a single CAR (c). B | The in vivo persistence of CAR T cells can be enhanced by using less-differentiated T cell subsets (a) or by engineering CAR T cells to express factors that foster a supportive microenvironment such as 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) (b). C | The trafficking and/or penetration of CAR T cells into solid tumours can be improved by engendering these cells with the ability to respond to tumour-associated chemokines (a) or to target physical barriers present in the tumour microenvironment (TME) (b). D | Finally, CAR T cells can be engineered to overcome the immunosuppressive factors present in the TME, for example, by circumventing the activity of inhibitory immune checkpoints, including programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) for recruitment from the blood, with some promising responses observed. Local infusion of CAR T cells might also limit on-target, off-tumour toxicities 143 . This general approach might be limited to single tumour lesions or oligometastatic disease and might be more resource intensive than more established local therapies; however, locally delivered CAR T cells have the potential to expand and traffic to other tumour sites and to promote responses of endogenous immune cells against tumours. Indeed, in two patients who received infusions of T cells transduced with mRNA encoding an anti-mesothelin CAR, one of whom received both intravenous and regional infusions, evidence of an evoked antitumour humoral response involving multiple additional antigens was detected 140 . Similar results have not yet been widely reported in studies involving the intratumoural delivery of CAR T cells, but this result illustrates the potential to use localized delivery to initiate systemic antitumour immune responses. Nevertheless, many metastatic solid tumours are not amenable to localized therapy and thus efforts to engineer CAR T cells with an intrinsic ability to traffic to sites of disease are underway.",

An alternative approach involves PD-1 switch receptors, in which the extracellular domain of PD-1 is fused to the transmembrane and intracellular signalling domain of CD28. Accordingly, these switch receptors transduce an activating co-stimulatory signal when stimulated by PD-L1 as well as acting as dominant-negative inhibitors of immunosuppressive signalling via endogenous PD-1 molecules in T cells [162] [163] [164] or CAR T cells 165 used for adoptive cell therapy, thereby enhancing efficacy in various preclinical models. CAR T cells have also been engineered to secrete antagonistic IgG1 antibodies that can bind to PD-L1 on tumour cells and antigenpresenting cells, which prevents T cell exhaustion and recruits NK cells that can mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity to tumours, as demonstrated in a mouse xenograft model of renal cell carcinoma 166 .

For example, arginine has important roles in T cell function 181 , and competition with cancer cells and other cells of the TME for this amino acid might result in suppression of the antitumour activity of T cells. Accordingly, pre-treatment of TCR-transgenic T cells with arginine in vitro increased the antitumour activity of these cells after infusion into mice with melanomas expressing the cognate antigen 181 . Intriguingly, elevated potassium levels in the TME have been shown to influence nutrient uptake by T cells, resulting in metabolic shifts and epigenetic changes that preserve T cell stemness and inhibit the differentiation of these cells towards effector phenotypes 182 . Correspondingly, in vitro pre-treatment with potassium increases the persistence and antitumour activity of adoptively transferred human T cells in mouse xenograft models 182 . In another example of modification of T cell metabolism to overcome aspects of the metabolically hostile TME, expression of the antioxidant enzyme catalase enables T cells to overcome granulocyte-mediated oxidative stress in vitro 183 .

Regardless of the number of TAAs targeted, antigen escape is always a concern with CAR T cell therapy and thus recruitment of endogenous immune cells might be necessary to propagate the antitumour immune response. Augmenting CAR T cells to secrete stimulatory cytokines that not only foster the proliferation, survival and antitumour activity of T cells but also alter the immune milieu of solid tumours is an area of active investigation. Indeed, numerous cytokines have been explored to create such forms of armoured CAR T cells (Fig. 4Db) , which are also known as T cells redirected for universal cytokine killing (TRUCKs) 184 .",

IL-12 has a multifaceted role in the immune response, including activation of both T cells and NK cells. Subsequently, genetic modification of CAR T cells to express IL-12 resulted in increased cytotoxicity and resistance to T reg cellmediated inhibition in vitro, better engraftment without preconditioning chemotherapy and enhanced antitumour activity in vivo 185 . IL-12 expression also resulted in dramatic CAR T cell expansion from limited numbers of cells isolated from umbilical cord blood samples, introducing the possibility of generating CAR T cells from small volumes of cord blood for patients with haematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) 115 . In a subsequent study 186 , IL-12-secreting CAR T cells targeting MUC16 ecto , which is the membrane-retained portion of the serum cancer biomarker mucin-16 (CA-125), were subsequently shown to have increased antitumour activity in xenograft or immunocompetent syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer 187 . In these models, the IL-12-secreting armoured CAR T cells had an increased proliferative capacity, better survival and greater cytotoxicity than the parental, unarmoured CAR T cells and were also more resistant to apoptosis and PD-L1-induced dysfunction 187 . Together, these data supported the initiation of a clinical trial of MUC16 ecto -targeted, IL-12-secreting CAR T cells in patients with ovarian cancer (NCT02498912) 188 . In mice xenografted with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-positive and CEAcolon cancer cell lines, IL-12secreting, CEA-targeting CAR T cells have greater anticancer activity than their counterparts lacking IL-12 secretion through promotion of macrophage-mediated killing of the antigen-negative tumour cells 189 . Similarly, IL-12-secreting CARs targeting VEGFR2 have increased efficacy in multiple mouse models of well-vascularized solid cancers 190 . In these models, CAR T cells also altered the immunosuppressive TME by targeting VEGFR2-expressing myeloid-derived suppressor cells; however, the overall antitumour effect was dependent on the expression of the IL-12 receptor on host cells other than T cells and B cells 190 . Notably, lethal toxicity has been observed in clinical trials with systemic IL-12 infusions 191 , and life-threatening haemodynamic instability was observed in a clinical trial of IL-12-secreting tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes 192 ; however, expression of IL-12 by CAR T cells via different gene-expression cassettes, for example, from internal ribosome entry sites or promoters with inducible nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) binding motifs, can result in lower levels of IL-12 production 193, 194 . Thus, preclinical results have demonstrated the therapeutic promise of IL-12-secreting CAR T cells, although drastic dose-dependent variability in immune responses and toxicities are concerns that must be considered in ongoing and future clinical trials.",

Secretion of IL-15 by anti-IL-13R\u03b12 CAR T cells and by anti-GD2 CAR T cells has subsequently been shown to increase the survival of mice bearing orthotopic glioma xenografts 196 and metastatic neuroblastoma xenografts 197 , respectively. In a mouse xenograft model of leukaemia, a modified form of IL-15 tethered to the cell membrane of CAR T cells enhanced the anticancer activity and persistence of these cells, engendering them with a memory-like phenotype, and prevented disease relapse 198 . Moreover, fusion of the IL-15 receptor signalling domain to the CD28 co-stimulatory signalling domain of an anti-CD19 CAR resulted in the generation of CAR T cells with enhanced in vivo persistence in preclinical models and induced complete remission in one patient with ALL 199 . Thus, IL-15 can enhance the persistence and activity of CAR T cells in vivo, although limited evidence of the effects on the TME in immunocompetent models is available for this cytokine. Additionally, concerning exogenous cytokine-independent in vitro clonal expansion has been observed following transduction of mature human lymphocytes to express IL-15, suggesting a potentially dangerous autocrine loop 200 . Moreover, mice with nearubiquitous overexpression of IL-15 develop leukaemia with a T cell or NK cell phenotype 201 . Clinically, toxicities, such as hypotension, thrombocytopenia and elevations in serum aspartate transaminase and/or alanine transaminase levels, have been observed with systemic administration of IL-15 (reF. 202 ). Given that the half-life of the recombinant IL-15 used in this trial was <3 hours, IL-15 produced continuously by CAR T cells might have different pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles. Nevertheless, engineering strategies using nanogels to 'backpack' large quantities of IL-15 onto CAR T cells have revealed that high doses of IL-15 can be delivered to tumour sites without systemic toxicities, at least in preclinical models 203 .",

First, harvesting sufficient numbers of T cells from patients with cancer can be difficult, as many patients are lymphopenic as a sequalae of the disease or previous chemotherapy. In paediatric patients, chemotherapy also decreases the percentage of naive T cells in peripheral blood, which are important for the clinical activity of CAR T cells 214 , and low levels of this T cell subset can lead to production failure 215 .

Indeed, the treatment of patients with persistent B cell malignancies following allogeneic HSCT using donor-derived leukocytes expressing CD19directed CARs has led to complete and partial remissions [221] [222] [223] . GVHD has developed in a subset of patients in a few of these studies 222, 223 , although some of these events might have been attributable to prior treatment, and allogeneic CAR T cell therapy has been associated with a lower rate of GVHD than that expected with traditional donor lymphocyte infusion. The CAR constructs used in these studies had a CD28 co-stimulatory domain, and findings in preclinical models have suggested that CARs with a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain are associated with a greater risk of GVHD than those with a CD28 co-stimulatory domain 224 . Partially HLA-matched donor-derived viral antigen-specific T cells are a second potential source of allogeneic T cells for transduction with CAR constructs 50 .

These approaches have the dual advantage of eliminating the endogenous TCR, thereby reducing the risk of GVHD and thus facilitating the use of allogeneic CAR T cells, whilst simultaneously enhancing CAR T cell function by reducing tonic signalling and ensuring uniform cell-surface levels of CAR expression as well as efficient recycling of internalized CARs back to the cell surface.",

Furthermore, knockout of MHC I molecules might lead to NK cell-mediated killing and might not prevent CAR T cell rejection mediated by MHC II molecules, which are expressed in activated T cells.

This approach ensures that the MHC restriction of the infused CAR T cells is determined by the host MHC molecules, thereby reducing the risk of GVHD. Naive T cells have been generated from haematopoietic stem cells present in donor bone marrow or cord blood samples, embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells through culturing with stromal cells and Notch ligands, commonly the OP9 mouse bone marrow stromal cell line and Delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1) or DLL4 (reF. 242 ). Preclinical studies with CAR-expressing T cell precursors have demonstrated in vivo maturation of these T cells, with no GVHD observed 243, 244 . Importantly, donor T cells that have been reprogrammed to restore pluripotency and create CAR iPS cells are capable of self-renewal and can be banked 245 . Indeed, a single cell-derived CAR iPS master cell line, FT819, has been created by dedifferentiating peripheral T cells into iPS cells followed by biallelic disruption of the TRAC locus with the CAR gene 246, 247 . This strategy has resulted in a well-defined, expandable cell product derived from a single source with no native TCR and with expression of the CAR under transcriptional control of the TRAC endogenous regulatory elements. Eliminating the requirement to generate an autologous CAR T cell product through the aforementioned approaches might avoid treatment delays. In addition, the development of universal CAR T cells will provide opportunities for upscaling of manufacturing and banking of the product. These improvements in manufacturing could potentially expand the access of patients with cancer to CAR T cell therapies and might also lead to decreases in the substantial costs of CAR T cell therapies.",

The modular design of current CARs (Fig. 1 ) enables refinements to address the diseasespecific challenges posed by the TME. By using synthetic biology and gene-editing technologies, researchers can efficiently engineer CAR T cells to be safer and more effective (Fig. 5) . Moreover, CAR T cells can be used as living T cell 'micropharmacies' for the targeted delivery of immunomodulatory molecules to the TME. Importantly, however, increasing the complexity of CAR designs and gene editing of T cells might amplify the risks associated with CAR T cell therapy. For example, viral transduction and the use of gene-editing machineries come with the danger of off-target disruption of genes 232 . Indeed, transformation of T cells into malignant clones, owing to insertional mutagenesis involving either activation of endogenous proto-oncogenes by viral promoters or disruption of tumour-suppressor genes, is a well-anticipated theoretical risk of any gene therapy. Such transformation through insertional mutagenesis has not been described in patients to date, although viral insertion into genes has been observed clinically in lentivirally transduced CAR T cells used in the treatment of a patient with CLL 248 . Specifically, the CAR gene was inserted into the TET2 loci and led to a clonal expansion of T cells 248 contracted spontaneously, but this event highlights the risk of treating patients with genetically modified cells. As experience with adoptive cell transfer accumulates, however, researchers are becoming more comfortable with this risk, and a first-in-human trial has been initiated to evaluate an NY-ESO-1-directed transgenic TCR T cell product with multiple CRISPR-Cas9 gene edits to remove endogenous TCR and PD-1 (NCT03399448).",

A | CAR T cells with on/off switches predicated on small-molecule adapter ligands (a), CAR subunitdimerizing agents (b), inhibitors of signalling downstream of the CAR (c), or protease inhibitors used to control CAR protein expression (d). B | Suicide gene systems that enable elimination of CAR T cells via induction of apoptosis (a) or antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (b). C | CAR T cells engendered with the intrinsic ability to secrete factors that neutralize relevant cytokines.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are typically designed to target tumour-associated antigens (TAAs); however, expression of these antigens on healthy tissues can result in 'on-target, off-tumour' CAR T cell-mediated toxicities. A | Engineering strategies aiming to overcome this include mechanisms whereby the tumour specificity of CAR T cells is enhanced by ensuring dependency of functional activation on the recognition of multiple TAAs (a), the absence of an antigen selectively expressed on non-malignant cells (b), or the presence of factors that are typically enriched on tumour cells, such as the phosphoantigens that can be recognized via \u03b3\u03b4T cell receptors (TCRs) (c), or in the tumour microenvironment (TME) such as the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-4 (d). B | Alternative strategies are based on logic gating and/or conditional expression systems, whereby expression of a CAR targeting a particular TAA is dependent on activation of another engineered transgenic receptor, such as synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors, by a different TAA (a) or is driven by a factor associated with the TME such as hypoxia (b).
