All along, there have been different views on the formulation and development of ecological aesthetics. This is because ecological aesthetics is a new aesthetic concept, and its understanding and acceptance must proceed over time. At the same time, more importantly, the academic colleagues engaged in the study of ecological aesthetics have not done enough in the construction of ecological aesthetics; they have not yet provided more explanatory results for the rationality of ecological aesthetics. Therefore, we need to redouble our efforts. We believe that for the construction of ecological aesthetics, there is need for reflection on two aspects:\nEcological aesthetics is an emerging discipline in the post-modern context\n\n",

            "text": "There is a lot of controversy in the academic field as to whether ecological aesthetics can become a discipline. The crucial reason is that it has not been fully understood in the postmodern context regarding the nature of the emerging discipline. Regarding its historical location, ecological aesthetics is the product of post-industrial society in the late 20th century, especially since the 21st century, and is an emerging discipline different from the traditional disciplines in the postmodern context. As a new discipline in the postmodern context, it has several characteristics: one is its transcendence of reflection. In other words, ecological aesthetics is the result of transcending reflection on traditional aesthetics. It is both a reflection and the transcendence of epistemology of \u201ctraditional anthropology\u201d and \u201canthropocentrism,\u201d as well as a transcendence of traditional aesthetics that completely disregards the ecological dimension and is confined to artistic aesthetics. Therefore, ecological aesthetics is an unprecedented aesthetic form that contains ecological dimensions. The second is open pluralism. As a new discipline in the postmodern context, ecological aesthetics, unlike traditional disciplines, has some kind of super-stability, but as an open and pluralistic system. As the author of deep ecology, Alan Naisi said, his ecological philosophy is only ecological philosophy A. There will be other theorists to join them, as representatives of ecological philosophy B, C, D, E, F, G\u2026 and many more. This book expresses our view of ecological aesthetics, which was put forward for your reference, not and it is not possible to be determined at once. The development of ecological aesthetics needs to have more people join them. The third is interdisciplinarity. As a new discipline in the postmodern context, ecological aesthetics has obvious interdisciplinarity, including aesthetics, ecological philosophy, ecological ethics and so on. The fourth is constructive. As a new discipline in the postmodern context, ecological aesthetics has the characteristic of construction. It has developed with the times and has obvious character of advancing with the times. Therefore, the development of ecological aesthetics welcomes more scholars from other related disciplines involved in the construction.(2)\nThe importance of the birth of ecological aesthetics\n\n",

            "text": "We believe that contemporary ecological aesthetics should become the most basic view of the human world in the new century and become our basic cultural standpoint and attitude towards life. Facts have shown that since the 1960s, the relationship between humankind and nature has undergone significant changes. That is, since the industrial revolution, a \u201csubject and object\u201d mode of thinking is no longer able to adapt to the new situation requirements. The opposition between human beings and nature has been extremely threatening to the survival of humankind. First of all, the opposition between human beings and nature has led to the frequent occurrence of various ecological crises. From the well-known \u201cLondon fog\u201d to the amazing Japanese \u201cMinamata disease,\u201d as well as the recent \u201cSARS virus,\u201d \u201cIndonesian tsunami,\u201d \u201cH1N1 influenza\u201d and so on\u2014all of these are natural punishments for human destruction. And in recent years the raging \u201cdust storm,\u201d \u201cHuaihe pollution,\u201d \u201cTaihu cyanobacteria\u201d and so on in China, have all been recognized as serious environmental crises, which are direct threats to human health and safety, and are even related to the success or failure of China\u2019s modernization. To continue to oppose nature or to maintain harmony with nature has become a crucial choice for human beings at the crossroads of success or failure. This was Rachel Carson\u2019s warning 45 years ago, one of the pioneers of contemporary ecological theory. The antagonism of human beings among themselves, especially the war crisis caused by the capitalist system, and the great development of science and technology, makes any war enough to cause the destruction of humankind. Human-made nuclear weapons have been enough to destroy the whole of human civilization. The expansion of contemporary capitalism and the severe opposition between the north and the south and the rich and the poor caused by exploitation make hundreds of millions of people live in hunger and pain. In this case, ontology will replace epistemology, and \u201csymbiosis\u201d will replace anthropocentrism as the core of the contemporary values and attitudes towards life.",

            "text": "Regarding \u201csymbiosis,\u201d the first is the symbiosis of human beings and nature, as the relationship between human beings and nature is the basis and premise of the relationship between human and the world. The most basic difference between human beings and animals is the unity of animals and nature; the \u201crelationship\u201d between them does not matter. People are distinguished from nature, resulting in the \u201crelationship\u201d between human beings and nature. The pursuit of harmony between humankind and nature is the eternal goal of humankind. Different historical times have ushered in different relationships between human beings and nature, resulting in a different outlook on life and aesthetics. In ancient times, humankind had just diverged from nature, and the power of nature was far superior to that of humankind. Human beings and nature were antagonistic. Human beings had an inexplicable reverence for and fear of nature, which contains the world view that \u201call things are spiritual.\u201d To achieve harmony between human beings and nature with simple and bold artistic creation, the pursuit of poetic dwelling constitutes the period of the \u201csymbolic\u201d aesthetic. In the period of agricultural society, despite the great development of human society, the power of nature was still far better than that of human beings. The desire of humankind to live in harmony with nature and in the hope of religion and its resurrection is to develop a religious worldview that hope for the afterlife. In the aesthetic domain, it is manifested in the combination of suffering and salvation. After the industrial revolution, with the development of science and technology, public rationality, social progress, and life improvement, people obtained a dominant position in the relationship with nature. However, the \u201canthropocentric\u201d outlook on life also appeared, which takes the form of excessive superstition regarding science and technology, as well as the dwelling of science and technology instead of poetic dwelling. This distorted aesthetics shelters people with things. Since the mid-20th century, especially in the new century, through the negative effects of the reflection on the rationality of \u201canthropocentrism,\u201d human beings put forward the concept of nature as an \u201cecological whole\u201d and \u201csymbiosis\u201d of the world view. In aesthetics, it is put forward through the \u201cThe Fourfold Game of Sky, Earth, Man and Gods\u201d to the ecological aesthetics of people\u2019s \u201cpoetic dwelling.\u201d Since then, the ecological concept of a \u201csymbiotic\u201d relationship between human beings and nature has attracted more and more attention from humankind. In 1972, The United Nations tried to make the harmony between human beings and nature become the consensus of all humankind through the Declaration of the Environment. China has also developed a sustainable development strategy in the 1990s, and recently put forward the strategic concept of \u201cscientific development concept\u201d and \u201cenvironment-friendly society.\u201d",

            "text": "But there is always a difficult contradiction entangled within the relationship between human beings and nature, between development and environmental protection, and between contemporary and future generations. On the one hand, there is the strong advocacy of environmental protection. On the other hand, driven by economic interests, ecological damage and environmental pollution is increasing. The seriousness of the problem has gone far beyond the people\u2019s good wishes and ecological affordability, Environmental and ecological disasters are an increasing trend, and the seriousness of the situation may have gone far beyond people\u2019s estimates. It is time to face it and change it directly. But the key to the problem lies in the cultural attitude of people and the lifestyles they choose. The famous Roman club sponsor Beyerce has long foreseen and discussed this. It is imperative to change people\u2019s outlook on life, their cultural attitudes, and their lifestyles as soon as possible. In contemporary times, we should advocate a kind of \u201csymbiosis\u201d as the main connotation of life, cultural attitudes, and lifestyles. \u201cPoetic dwelling\u201d should be its goal of ecological aesthetic. This is a new aesthetic concept which is a kind of \u201cbeing in the world\u201d with the existence of existence as its philosophical basis. It treats the relationship between human beings and nature with an aesthetic attitude as its main content, and it promotes combining the current moment of human beings with the future good life as its purpose. It is in line with the reality of the development of society today. The scientific concept of development is the important content of contemporary advanced ecological culture. This kind of ecological aesthetics is a kind of \u201cparticipatory\u201d aesthetic, which is different from the traditional view of Kant\u2019s. It is not only the pleasure of the body as a basis for happiness. Rather, it treats aesthetics as a guide to transform reality, which requires people to follow the laws of ecological aesthetics to transform reality and achieve harmony between human beings and nature. This is exactly what Marx had foreseen, which is the combination of thorough naturalism and thorough humanitarianism in future society. This kind of effort to have ecological aesthetics as the new century\u2019s basic view of life is of great significance. However, it is also a very difficult historical task. As an integral part of a grand project, it should be included in the learning and practice of the contemporary, scientific concept of development. Only by treating nature with an aesthetic attitude, as well as the corresponding aesthetic attitude towards others, society, and their own, can contemporary society really move along the road of harmonious development. We believe that it will change people\u2019s natural, ecological, aesthetic, and lifestyle views, and achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, as well as the aspirations of our people to have a good habitat through this ambitious study.2.\nThe Role of Contemporary Aesthetics Discipline Construction\n\n",

            "text": "The formulation and development of ecological aesthetics plays an important role in the construction of contemporary aesthetics. First of all, it renews the traditional concept of natural beauty and constructs a new ecology aesthetics. There is always a debate on this issue regarding whether ecological aesthetics can become an independent discipline. We feel that in the new transition period, ecological aesthetics is at least a new discipline growing point. It may not be mature enough, but it generally already possessed a prototype as an independent discipline. In general, a relatively independent subject should have a relatively independent theoretical category, relatively independent research methods, and a relatively independent scholar group. This criterion is, of course, the product of the intellectual system of modern enlightenment, but it still has its reference value under the current educational and disciplinary system. If the basic requirements are set up from the above disciplines, ecological aesthetics can be said to have been initially equipped with the above three elements. From the relatively independent theoretical category, it first renews the traditional concept of natural beauty, and does not admit that nature is opposed to people. Therefore it does not think that there is so-called \u201cnatural beauty,\u201d which is a separate from people. Rather, there is only the beauty of natural ecology, which is the harmonious coexistence between human beings and nature. Although natural ecology is closely linked with people and even inseparable, it constitutes a relatively independent area compared with the arts and daily life. The International Society of Aesthetics President Petzwald recently said that there is aesthetics of the ecological environment, the aesthetics of artistic philosophy, and the aesthetics of everyday life. The object of ecological aesthetics is the ecological system that includes people, rather than from the outside of the so-called \u201cnatural.\u201d Its most basic aesthetic category is the ecological existence of aesthetics, as well as the \u201cpoetic dwelling,\u201d \u201cthe Fourfold Game,\u201d \u201chome consciousness,\u201d \u201cplace consciousness,\u201d \u201cparticipation in aesthetics,\u201d \u201cecological aesthetic education,\u201d \u201cecological literature,\u201d \u201ctwo forms of ecological aesthetics,\u201d \u201cecological aesthetic education,\u201d and so on. These aesthetic categories represent a clear breakthrough and innovation compared to the three-point method of traditional aesthetics of \u201cbeauty, the feeling of beauty, and art.\u201d Regarding its research method, contemporary ecological aesthetics is different from the traditional epistemological research methods. However, it has adopted contemporary ontology and ecological phenomenology as a method. Because only in the sense of the ontology, as well as from the ecological phenomenology approach, can ecology, humanism, and aesthetics can be truly unified. Ecological aesthetic research scholars, it now appears, are also in the gradual growth stage.",

On the other hand, the development of ecological aesthetics is of great significance to the whole aesthetic discipline. It broke through the traditional epistemological model that \u201caesthetics is the philosophy of art,\u201d by claiming that natural ecology is a very important research content. It also breaks the tendency of \u201canthropocentrism\u201d in the long-standing aesthetic research, and promotes \u201cecological holism\u201d and \u201cecological humanism\u201d in the study of aesthetics. These basic theoretical concepts will greatly affect the art and the aesthetic of daily life, and will bring about important changes for these areas.3.\nThe role of value reconstruction in contemporary aesthetics\n\n",

            "text": "At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the German philosopher Nietzsche put forward a major idea of \u201cvalue reconstruction.\u201d This means that the rapid transformation of society requires the adaptation of philosophy and aesthetics to the necessary value reconstruction. The proposal and development of ecological aesthetics has an important role in the reconstruction of value in the field of aesthetics. Because the relationship between human beings and nature is the most basic relationship in human life, if the grasp of this relationship is to achieve a major shift from anthropocentrism to ecological holism, as well as from epistemology to ontology, then the associated field of aesthetics is bound to follow the change. Earlier, we have already said that the proposal and development of ecological aesthetics occurred during the development from art to nature and life in the aesthetic research project. From the perspective of research, there has been a change from epistemology to the existential theory of being, etc. Some of the relevant theoretical concepts will also change accordingly, such as the definition of traditional literature and aesthetics based on the established epistemology and the notion of the \u201cmirror.\u201d Now it seems to be a problem because they are based on the aesthetic and literary theory of the \u201csubject and object dichotomy.\u201d Additionally, the \u201ctypical theory\u201d that literature and art are higher than life also needs to be re-examined. From the concept of ecological aesthetics, natural ecology and people are symbiotic, with a relationship of common, mutual construction. Each has its richness and irreplaceability. There is no question of who is higher than anyone else. At the forefront of contemporary ecological aesthetics, Plato\u2019s \u201ctheory of mind,\u201d Hegel\u2019s \u201cbeauty is the sensibility of the concept of appearance,\u201d and Kant\u2019s \u201cquiet\u201d aesthetics, all have obvious historical limitations. For Chernyshevsky\u2019s theory of \u201cbeauty is life,\u201d we have generally criticized its \u201cmechanical materialism\u201d tendency for a long time, basically denying it. However, the proposal and development of ecological aesthetics has led us to see that the theory of \u201cbeauty is life,\u201d also contains valuable features that emphasize ecology and life. For example, Chernyshevsky\u2019s emphasis on \u201cexuberant health and balanced physique,\u201d and the \u201cbeauty of the characteristics,\u201d has a special significance and value. Additionally, the establishment of the split between body and spirit is only by virtue of the audio-visual senses or \u201cquiet\u201d aesthetics. Ecological aesthetics emphasizes that aesthetics is based on spiritual unity, which does not rule out the other body senses in the aesthetic role, thus advocating \u201cparticipation in aesthetics.\u201d This is also a new breakthrough. The \u201csymbiotic\u201d concept, \u201chome consciousness\u201d and \u201cplace awareness\u201d and so on, under the guidance of ecological aesthetics theory, have also had an important impact on contemporary architectural aesthetics, landscape aesthetics, tourism aesthetics, and so on. It is possible to update many traditional ideas. The proposition and development of ecological aesthetics is also a reversal of the tendency of the west to basically deny the value of oriental aesthetics. No doubt, ecological aesthetics has important significance on the re-evaluation of ancient Chinese aesthetics, and breaking the \u201cEuro-centrism\u201d as well as the so-called \u201cOriental aesthetics of non-logical\u201d conclusion, and rediscovering the Oriental aesthetics, especially the meaning of life aesthetics of the ancient Chinese classical ecological existence, which is that \u201clife is easy.\u201d4.\nThe special role of contemporary literary criticism\n\n",

Ecological aesthetics advocates the \u201caesthetics of ecological existence theory,\u201d follow the \u201cgreen principle,\u201d and \u201chome consciousness,\u201d which plays a special role in literary criticism. According to these principles, we not only rediscover the special contributions of Rousseau, Thoreau, Leopold, and so on in the development of ecological aesthetics and ecological literature, but, more importantly, we discover the ecological and aesthetic wisdom of Confucianism and Buddhism of ancient China since the pre-Qin Dynasty. To understand and evaluate a series of ancient and modern important literary works by the use of ecological aesthetics and methods is a significant event. For example, we have re-interpretated and evaluated the famous western Chatterley Lady\u2019s Lover, Moby Dick and so on, which are familiar to all of us from the perspective of ecological aesthetics. For the literary works of other Renaissance and Enlightenment periods, we also affirmed the historical status of \u201chumanism\u201d related to \u201canthropocentrism,\u201d while revealing the limitations of its time. For example, we all know Shakespeare\u2019s famous drama Hamlet for the great praise of the people: \u201cnoble reason! The essence of the universe! The spirit of all things!\u201d This obvious \u201canthropocentrism\u201d should now be re-evaluated according to ecological aesthetics. For ecological aesthetic wisdom in our country with The Book of Songs as the representative of ancient art works, we should also be based on the principle of ecological aesthetics to be re-excavated and explained.5.\nThe role of practical guidance\n\n",

            "text": "At present, the academic field\u2019s doubts about ecological aesthetics mainly focus on how to unify people and nature, or how to unify the ecological view, the humanist view, and the aesthetic view. This is actually related to the principle of whether ecological aesthetics can be established. To solve this problem, we must achieve a major transformation of philosophy and adjustment. Facts have shown that the reason why ecological aesthetics can be established, and that people, nature, ecology, humanities, and aesthetics can be unified, is that the philosophical basis of modern ecological aesthetics is the concept of ecological ontology. This is, first of all, an era and academic progress. It is a breakthrough in traditional epistemology and \u201canthropocentrism.\u201d The history of philosophy tells us that the relationship between human beings and the world has two models. One is the traditional, epistemological model, in which the subject and object are diagonally opposed. It led to the emergence of \u201canthropocentrism\u201d during the era of the industrial revolution, which believes that human beings can dominate everything, and that the source of later \u201cecocentrism,\u201d which believes that non-human creatures can have greater value than human beings. But this subject and object dichotomy and epistemological model, as well as the resulting \u201canthropocentrism\u201d and \u201cecocentrism\u201d have been historically proven to be impracticable. In this way, at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, there was a philosophical view of existentialism different from epistemological philosophy. This view of existential philosophy is a \u201cbeing in the world\u201d mode of life, which advocates that people and all things are symbiotic, and together constitute the world. People as \u201cthis\u201d have the ability to understand and explain the meaning and value of all things. Heidegger pointed out: \u201cDasein is an entity which, in its very Being, comports itself understanding towards that Being. In saying this, we are calling attention to the formal concept of existence. Dasein exists. Furthermore, Dasein is an entity which in each case I myself am.\u201d1 also said, \u201cThe concept of \u2018facticity\u2019. Implies that an entity \u2018within-the-world\u2019 has Being-in-the-world in such a way that it can understand itself as bound up its \u2018destiny\u2019 with the Being of those entities which it encounters within its own world.\u201d2 Here, Heidegger summed up the \u201cDasein and the world\u201d mode of life with \u201cwithin-the-world.\u201d Moreover, this \u201cwithin-the- world\u201d also means that the \u201cDasein\u201d of that person also has the \u201cbeing\u201d of all who are in existence, and have the \u201cdestiny\u201d that has been within the world, which is bound up by all the people who encounter it. In other words, people and all things on earth are closely linked. They form a symbiosis and common prosperity. They cannot be away even for a few moments, and together they constitute the \u201cworld.\u201d In fact, this is the concept of ecological ontology: it is a kind of existential philosophy with an ecological dimension. It is the philosophical foundation of human beings and nature and the unity of ecology and humanism. The theory of ecological existence is a new concept of aesthetics. It abandons the substantive concept of beauty, and places beauty in certain world relations, seeing beauty as the process of the gradual emergence of the truth, which is put forward in the famous proposition that \u201cbeauty is the self-placed truth.\u201d Here, the existence of the existence of \u201cDasein\u201d in the understanding and in interpretation, gradually moves from shelter to clarity. Its truth is to self-display, and the beauty is to be presented. This is the unity of existence, the unity of truth, the appearance of beauty, and the unity of ecology, humanism, and aesthetics. It should be noted that the philosophical basis of ecological aesthetics and of the ecological existence is our basic view of ecological aesthetics. This does not exclude other understandings of ecological aesthetics. The openness of ecological aesthetics makes it completely willing to accept the argument and analysis of various views. For example, there is a \u201cweak anthropocentrism\u201d view in ecological philosophy, ecological literature, and ecological aesthetics, which advocates we should not give up the guidance of epistemology on ecological theory. We believe that this is also a valuable consideration. As long as both theory and practice can work together, we may wish to co-exist with it. The famous American contemporary ecological writer Silovik clearly expressed his theory of epistemology, which does not prevent him from becoming an important ecological writer. Of course, the inherent theory of self-consistency is worthy of scrutiny. However, these are all matters within the scope of academic discussion.",

From a cultural standpoint, ecological aesthetics and environmental aesthetics have two common positions, which is the standpoint of jointly advocating the protection of the ecological environment in the face of serious ecological damage in contemporary China. China\u2019s contemporary ecological aesthetics is actually a product of the gradual deepening of China\u2019s modernization and its entry into the era of ecological civilization. It regards the construction of ecological civilization as its own goal, and environmental aesthetics is also produced after western environmental problems have been highlighted, taking environmental protection as its own firm stance. As the Finnish environmental esthetician Joseph Seppama said, \u201cWe can see more and more clearly that modern environmental aesthetics started only in the 1960s and was a product of the environmental movement and its way of thinking. The emphasis on ecology distinguishes today\u2019s environmental aesthetics from the German version of the earlier 100-year-old.\u201d He also explicitly regards \u201cecological principles\u201d as one of the important principles of environmental aesthetics, pointing out that \u201cin nature, when a natural cycle process is continuous and self-contained, the system is a healthy system.\u201d3 Another common position is that they represent a breakthrough for traditional aesthetics that ignore natural aesthetics. China\u2019s ecological aesthetics researchers have made it clear that the most basic feature of ecological aesthetics is that it is a kind of aesthetic that contains an ecological dimension.4 an important position of western contemporary environmental aesthetics is a breakthrough in traditional aesthetic neglect of the natural ecological environmental aesthetics. Allen Carlson, a prominent Canadian environmental aesthetist, points out in his book Aesthetics and the Environmental:\u201cMany of the issues in contemporary work on the aesthetics of nature are foreshadowed in one article: Ronald W. Hepburn\u2019s seminal \u201cContemporary Aesthetics and the Neglect of Natural Beauty.\u201d (see Footnote 5) After noting that by essentially reducing aesthetics to the philosophy of art, analytic aesthetics virtually ignores the natural world, Hepburn sets the agenda for the discussion of the late twentieth century. \u2026\u2026He furthermore suggests that with nature such serious appreciation may require different approaches that can accommodate not only nature\u2019s indeterminate and varying character, but also both our multi-sensory experience and our diverse understanding of it.5 The development of western environmental aesthetics is earlier. The ecological aesthetics produced in the mid-1990s in our country has obviously accepted the resources of environmental aesthetics. In the process of the construction of ecological aesthetics, environmental aesthetics has given great nourishment. Their discourse on \u201clivable\u201d ideas gives us great inspiration. In particular, Berleant\u2019s Art and Engagement, Ecology Phenomenology as well as the theoretical point of view that \u201cthere is nothing outside of nature\u201d affect us even more. It is from this sense that we believe that environmental aesthetics is an important resource and reference for the construction of contemporary Chinese ecological aesthetics.",

            "text": "Of course, China\u2019s ecological aesthetics and western environmental aesthetics still have some obvious differences. First, ecological aesthetics and environmental aesthetics originate in different times and regions. Environmental aesthetics originated in the Western developed countries of the 1960s. At that time, these countries basically completed industrialization, and most of them have relatively rich natural resources. It was in the mid-1990s, especially into the early 21st century that China began to gradually form a certain scale of ecological aesthetics research. Its historical background is a gradual deepening of industrialization, and scholars found that the simple dimension of economic development can\u2019t achieve modernization on its own, but must be accompanied by a cultural and aesthetic dimension. This is the reason for the scientific outlook on development and the construction of a harmonious society. The study of ecological aesthetics in our country has been gradually developed. Therefore, the construction of eco-aesthetics in our country is confronted with the current situation of a society in urgent need of economic development. Additionally, the unprecedented shortage of environmental resources, economic development, and environmental protection have all become needs. This is in contrast with the historical and cultural background proposed by western environmental aesthetics. Moreover, in the 21st century, humankind\u2019s understanding of ecological theory has also made great developments and changes. It is hard to sustain \u201canthropocentrism,\u201d and simple \u201cecocentrism\u201d can hardly become a reality. Rather, only the \u201csymbiosis\u201d between human beings and nature is the way to go. It is under such circumstances that eco-humanism and eco-holism have emerged that are more in line with the law of social development, and have become the theoretical fulcrum of contemporary ecological aesthetics.",

            "text": "Secondly, from the point of view of word meaning, \u201cecology\u201d and \u201cenvironment\u201d also have different meanings. The word \u201cenvironment,\u201d with the meaning of \u201cencirclement, revolving around, and surrounding things,\u201d clearly refers to the external being of people and the opposite of human beings. The environmental aesthetician Seppama himself thinks that \u201ceven the term \u2018environment\u2019 implies the human view that human beings are at the center and everything else surrounds him.\u201d6 In contrast, \u201cEcological\u201d has the meaning of \u201cecology and ecologically protected,\u201d while the prefix \u201ceco\u201d means ecologically, family, and economical. Heidegger said in the interpretation of \u201cbeing,\u201d that \u201c\u2018Being\u2019 does not mean that ready-made thing is \u2018one in the middle of another\u2019 in space; as far as origin is concerned, the \u201cin\u201d does not mean the spatial relationship of the above methods at all. \u2018In\u2019 is originated from innan-, living, habitare, stay. \u2018An\u2019 means that: I have lived, I am familiar, I am used to, I care; it has the meaning of colo: habito [I live] and diligo [I care].\u201d7 Here, \u201ccolo\u201d already has the \u201cliving\u201d and \u201cstay\u201d connotation. The term \u201cecology\u201d was first combined by the German biologist Haikel in 1866 with the two Greek words okios [\u2018homeland\u2019 or \u2018home\u2019] and logos [research]. It can be seen that the meaning of \u201cecology\u201d does include the meaning of \u201chome, residence, and stay\u201d and so on. It is more in line with the integration of man and nature than \u201cenvironment.\u201d From the perspective of ecological aesthetics as an ecological ontological aesthetics, the meaning of \u201cliving and staying\u201d included in \u201cecology\u201d more conforms to the connotation of the aesthetics of ecological existence.",

It has integrated the achievements of long-term exploration on the protection of the ecological environment for more than 100 years. It is well-known that over 100 years ago, humankind has been trying hard to explore the scientific relationship between humankind and the natural ecology, and experienced painful lessons of \u201canthropocentrism\u201d and \u201cecocentrism.\u201d \u201cAnthropocentrism\u201d has been shown to be an unreasonable path by more than 200 years of industrial revolution. Serious environmental pollution is a painful lesson left to humankind, and \u201cecocentrism\u201d is also an impossible way. Facts have shown that as a member of the ecological chain, all species, including humans, have only relative equality, and there can be no absolute equality. The absolute equality view of \u201cecocentrism\u201d is impossible, and can only be a thoroughly \u201cutopian\u201d idea. The only viable way is the path of \u201cecological holism\u201d and \u201cecological humanism.\u201d As Marxism advocates \u201cthe unity of naturalism and humanitarianism,\u201d Marx pointed out: \u201cThis communism, as completed naturalism, is equal to humanitarianism, and as completed humanitarianism, equal to naturalism.\u201d8 So called \u201cEcological holism\u201d and \u201cecological humanism\u201d are the synthesis and reconciliation of \u201canthropocentrism\u201d and \u201cecocentrism,\u201d which are the absorption of favorable factors and the abandonment of unfavorable factors.

            "text": "The history of \u201cenvironmental aesthetics\u201d is earlier, and is obviously limited by \u201canthropocentrism\u201d and \u201cecocentrism.\u201d The Beauty of Environment by Seppama has a more obvious \u201canthropocentric\u201d tendency. He not only defines the \u201cenvironment\u201d as something external to human beings, but also shows the tendency of \u201canthropocentrism\u201d in the connotation of \u201cenvironmental aesthetics.\u201d In his opinion, \u201cthe core area of environmental aesthetics is the issue of aesthetic objects,\u201d and \u201cmaking the environment an aesthetic object is usually based on the audience\u2019s choice.\u201d He chose to examine the way and object of investigation, and define its scope of time and space. He believes that, \u201caesthetic objects seem to mean the fact that this thing is at least to a certain extent suitable for aesthetic appreciation.\u201d9 It is clear that Seppama did not completely jump out of traditional aesthetics. He not only examines the aesthetic completely from the main body, but also considers the formation of aesthetic object of environmental aesthetics from the formal aesthetic of the traditional art, such as the proportion of form, symmetry and harmony, etc.. He treats this as the so-called \u201cpicturesque landscape,\u201d without considering ecological aesthetics\u2019 \u201cpoetic dwelling\u201d and \u201chomeland consciousness\u201d and so on, which it should have. In contrast, Carlson is a relatively complete environmentalist, and is more inclined to the \u201cecocentric\u201d point of view. His \u201cNatural All-Beauty Theory\u201d proposed in his book Aesthetics and the Environment is a reflection of this \u201cecocentrism.\u201d He said: \u201call the natural world is beautiful. According to this view, the natural environment, insofar as it is untouched by man, has mainly positive aesthetic qualities; it is, for example, graceful, delicate, intense, unified, and orderly, rather than bland, dull, insipid, incoherent, and chaotic. All virgin nature, in short, is essentially aesthetically good.\u201d10 He calls natural aesthetics \u201caffirmative aesthetics,\u201d with the help of many western ecological theorists\u2019 points of view. For example, the famous ecological theorist, Marsh, believes that nature is harmonious, and that humankind is an important disturbing body of harmony and nature. Geographer Rodin Tarter believes that humankind is terrible, nature is sublime and so on. Obviously, Carlson\u2019s \u201cNatural All-Beauty Theory\u201d is based on the theoretical stand of \u201cecocentrism,\u201d which thus leads to the total negation of human activities, including human artistic activities, which should be said to be very incomplete. Of course, environmental aesthetics also contains many profound and valuable aesthetic connotations. For example, Berleant\u2019s theory of \u201cenvironmental aesthetics\u201d is more scientific and reasonable. He actually advocated a brand new aesthetic concept of natural ecology. He said:\u201cEnvironment, in the large sense, is not a domain separate and distinct from ourselves as human inhabitants. We are rather continuous with environment, an integral part of its processes. The usual tradition in aesthetics has difficulty with this, for it claims that appreciation requires a receptive, contemplative attitude. Such an attitude befits an observer, but nature admits of no such observer, for nothing can remain apart and uninvolved.\u201d11 Here, he put forward the famous \u201cEnvironment, in the large sense,\u201d wherein \u201cnothing can remain apart.\u201d The \u201cnature\u201d here is not external to people or against people, but rather includes people. In fact, it is what we usually call a \u201cnatural system.\u201d What he calls \u201cAesthetics and the Environment\u201d opposes traditional aesthetics. It is an aesthetic of engagement applied to natural aesthetics, which is different from the \u201cstatic non-utilitarian aesthetics\u201d which emphasizes artistic appreciation represented by Kant. We are more willing to translate it into the \u201cAesthetics of Engagement,\u201d which refers to the active participation of the eyes, ears, and nose in the natural aesthetic. The theory of \u201cnothing can remain apart\u201d and the \u201cAesthetics of Engagement\u201d have become important resources and references for building ecological aesthetics.",

Therefore, its development depends on the construction of contemporary ecological civilization to provide realistic and theoretical support. As we all know, ecological aesthetics is the product of ecological civilization since the mid-20th century. Ecological civilization is the arrival of a new era after industrial civilization. Generally speaking, it began in the 1960s. However, its real birth was in the 1970s, marked by the United Nations Conference on Environment and the Environment Statement in 1972. In theory, it is the end of anthropocentrism, and the beginning of new eco-humanism. In practice, it is the end of treating nature as an enemy and the beginning of symbiosis between human beings and nature. Economic development is the end of a simple model of economic growth, though now we have reached the beginning of a win-win situation between economic development and natural ecological protection. This is actually the beginning of a new era. As a post-development country in China, the construction of ecological civilization really started in October 2007, after the national ideology formally proposed the goal of ecological civilization construction. Since then, the construction of ecological civilization has become an advanced culture in line with the direction of social and economic development. Ecological aesthetics is an integral part of this advanced culture. Only by linking up with the construction of ecological civilization in contemporary society can we gain the impetus from the construction of realistic ecological civilization, obtain the resources, obtain abundant information, and find the correct direction so as to make the construction of ecological aesthetics not only obtain some legitimacy and rationality\u2014thus making it firmly based on the reality\u2014but also can at the same time avoid many inconsistencies between the times and the reality in China. In this way, it will not become a kind of utopianism without a realistic interpretation and vitality. Of course, the development of ecological aesthetics is in great need of international dialogue. In a sense, our country currently does not have advanced status in the construction of ecological theory, including ecological aesthetics. The task of learning from foreign advanced theories is still heavy.
