One was a 75\u2010year\u2010old male (patient 1) and the other a 52\u2010year\u2010old female (patient 2), at 120 and 8 months after transplant, respectively (Table 1). Symptoms (cough, myalgia, and fever 38\u201039\u00b0C) started 3 and 1 days before admission for patients 1 and 2, respectively. At the time of infection diagnosis, graft function was stable in patient 1, while patient 2 had developed acute kidney injury (AKI). Both patients were on tacrolimus (Tac), steroids, and mycophenolate mofetil. Both patients presented with fever (38\u201039\u00b0C) and dyspnea at admission. Lung CT scan at admission showed typical radiological findings of COVID\u201019 pneumonia, with extensive bilateral ground\u2010glass opacities in both; specific treatment was started before arrival of nasopharyngeal swab test results (PCR, confirming SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection on day 3 and 2 after symptoms\u2019 onset). Mycophenolate and Tac were discontinued on the day of admission and both patients received hydroxychloroquine (200 mg twice daily) in addition to lopinavir + ritonavir or darunavir + cobicistat. None of the patients were on ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Both patients required non\u2010invasive ventilation, but no patient was transferred to the ICU. Patient 1 developed abrupt worsening of his respiratory conditions over a period of 24 to 38 hours and expired 5 days after admission before intubation. On day 6 after admission, patient 2 showed signs of systemic inflammation (plasmatic IL\u20106:108.2 pg/mL; normal range 0\u201010 pg/mL; Table 1). After progressive worsening of respiratory conditions requiring non\u2010invasive ventilation and being considered for intubation, the patient received colchicine (1 mg on day 8, and 0.5 mg/day thereafter) to reduce inflammation, due the unavailability of anti\u2010IL\u20106 receptor mAb tocilizumab. Anti\u2010retroviral therapy was stopped; 24 hour after colchicine administration, plasmatic IL\u20106 concentration decreased to 36 pg/mL, and respiratory conditions stabilized. At the time of writing (day 14 after initial symptoms), the patient is alert and stable on non\u2010invasive ventilation positive airway pressure (PaO2/FiO2 114, respiratory rate 22 rpm, arterial blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, hear rate 105 rpm). Serum creatinine has returned to baseline levels (1.4 mg/dL) and liver function test are normal. Tacrolimus blood trough levels had initially increased to 39.9 \u03bcg/L due to interaction with ritonavir and transient liver failure despite holding tacrolimus. On follow\u2010up, Tac trough levels had returned to target range and Tac was resumed on day 12 (blood levels 5.4 \u00b5g/L on Tac 0.5 mg twice daily).",
