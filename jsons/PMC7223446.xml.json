            "text": "Teschovirus A was formerly known as Porcine Teschovirus (PTV) (Cano-G\u00f3mez et al. 2017) and it causes infectious diseases in wild boars and swine. The diseases include enchephalomyelitis, diarrhoea, myocarditis, pneumonia and reproductive loses (Long et al. 1966; Knowles 2008; Chiu et al. 2012). Teschovirus A has been assigned to the genus Teschovirus, family Picornaviridae and order Picornavirales (Deng et al. 2012). A set of 13 serotypes of Teschovirus A (PTV-1 to PTV-13) have been identified (Cano-G\u00f3mez and Jim\u00e9nez-Clavero 2016). Majority of PTV serotypes may cause milder infection, myocarditis, pericarditis or reproductive disorders or may not produce any signs of infection at all in host organism. However, the serotype, i.e., PTV-1 has been known to cause infection of central nervous system (CNS) giving rise to neurological disease which may either show severe infection or mild infection (Edington et al. 1972). Severe infection is known as Teschen disease while mild infection is called Talfan disease (Manuelidis et al. 1954; Knowles 2008). Two different strains of PTV-1 are responsible for these two diseases (Doherty et al. 1999; Prod\u011blalov\u00e1 2012). Any neurological disorder caused by Teschovirus A is termed as Teschovirus encephalomyelitis. The first outbreak of Teschovirus encephalomyelitis took place in 1929 at Teschen in Czechoslovakia (Trefny 1930). Europe and its neighbouring continents were under the influence of this disease in 1940\u20131950. This havoc caused high mortality and morbidity of swine resulting in significant loss in swine industries (Kouba 2009). The disease spread widely across Ukraine, Russia, Madagascar, Japan, Maldavis, Romania, China and Uganda (Kouba 2009; Wang et al. 2010; Salles et al. 2011).",

It consists of a positive sense single-stranded RNA of size 7.1 kb in its genome and codes for only one polyprotein (Cano-G\u00f3mez and Jim\u00e9nez-Clavero 2016; Cano-G\u00f3mez et al. 2017). The virus is round in shape with a diameter of 30 nm (Zell et al. 2005; Cano-G\u00f3mez et al. 2017). In Teschovirus A, three precursor viral polypeptides arise when the polyprotein is nicked and further nicking of each results into several components, namely a leader (L) protein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D), a protease (3C), a virus-encoded peptide (3B), four structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4) and four non-structural proteins (3A, 2A, 2B and 2C) (Manuelidis et al. 1954; Zell et al. 2001; Zell et al. 2005). The genome of Teschovirus A also comprises of 5\u2032-UTR and 3\u2032-UTR sequences (Doherty et al. 1999; Zell et al. 2001). The virus has a capsid comprising of four structural proteins viz. VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4, wherein VP4 protein is located in the interior region of the capsid (Smith and Baker 1999).",

Moreover, an outbreak was reported recently where Teschovirus A affected farrows and caused diseases such as gastroenteritis and respiratory disease (Ventura et al. 2012). Infection by this virus also resulted into abortion and stillbirth (Liu et al. 2011). In recent years, severe outbreak was caused by Teschovirus A in Haiti, Canada and Dominican Republic and this had largely affected the morbidity and mortality rate of swines (Deng et al. 2012; Ventura et al. 2012). It is very difficult to entirely eradicate the virus. In order to control the disease caused by this virus, attenuated or inactivated vaccines were used (Alexandersen et al. 2019).",

Traditional vaccines are sometimes considered as unsafe since the live attenuated or inactivated viruses may turn to live viruses and cause diseases (Purcell et al. 2007). These vaccines can lead to skin irritation and other side-effects (Harrison et al. 1999). The development of peptide vaccine based on genomics and proteomics has been suggested as a potential intervention against disease causing organism (Jackwood et al. 2008). Various preclinical studies stated that epitope based peptide vaccines formulated by reverse vaccinology showed promising outcomes (Davies and Flower 2007). Bioinformatics tools provide a means for identifying the potential T-cell and B-cell epitopes for designing peptide vaccines against pathogen and moreover, the in vitro experiments for formulating vaccines have significantly decreased in quantity as a consequence of utilizing the in silico approach due to low cost and time requirements (Florea and Halldorsson 2003; Backert and Kohlbacher 2015). Compared to traditional vaccines, epitope-based vaccines are considered to be safer and cheaper (Ellis 1999).",

Development of T-cells takes place in thymus whereas development of B-cells occurs in bone marrow (Z\u00fa\u00f1iga-Pfl\u00fccker 2004). Certain components of the antigen, called epitopes of the invading agents are identified by these cells with the help of receptors present on their exterior surface (Weiss and Littman 1994). On recognition of an antigen, the production of antibodies is mediated by B-cells which can destroy the antigenic particle. Moreover, B-cells also develop into memory cells which provide future protection against the foreign invaders (Chaplin 2010). The destruction of foreign antigen by T-cells occurs in an organized fashion where a group of proteins called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules identify the antigen and exhibit them on APCs\u2019 surfaces and subsequently, T-cell receptor identifies the antigen presented by APCs and initiates its destruction (Valitutti et al. 1995; Jensen 2007; Lafuente and Reche 2009).",
