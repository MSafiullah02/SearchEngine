Retrospective collections are typically biobanks with existing significant genetic data and active connections to health systems. In these studies, there is the opportunity to opportunistically and rapidly develop a genetic study on susceptibility and severity. For example, in Finland with the national network of biobanks covering each hospital district, it is possible to acquire almost \u2018real-time\u2019 updates on COVID-19 status of individuals that are already part of the FinnGen study2. This group of studies is already connected and loosely structured via other initiatives such as the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative3.",

Few analyses that can benefit from maximal sample size are centralized. The primary analysis focuses on COVID-19 disease severity. There are challenges in defining COVID-19 severity across multiple studies and healthcare systems. We used a pragmatic approach which considers the use of invasive and noninvasive ventilation as an index of severity. The advantages of this approach is the possibility to easily retrieve this information from electronic health records and the widespread use of these procedures across healthcares. Studies that have collected detailed clinical information can perform secondary analyses using continuous markers of disease severity such as maximum respiratory rate during hospitalization or prior to invasive respiratory support.",

Hence, we propose using a multiethnic HLA reference panel constructed using deep-coverage whole-genome sequencing data from 21,546 individuals of five different populations: European, African, Latino, Asian, and South Asian. This reference panel will capture much of the HLA variation around the world. This will allow to test each HLA allele and also each of the amino acid site position within HLA genes to assess if they explain COVID risk.",

Most studies (71%) have initiated a new prospective collection, 27% have done that on top of existing retrospective collections. Array-based genotyping is the most common approach, considered by 69% of the participant studies, while exome and genome sequencing are less common, (29%).
