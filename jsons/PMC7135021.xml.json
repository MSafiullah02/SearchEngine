Subsequent to the first and the strongest impact of the initial news of seropositivity, infected persons have to experience lots of direct burdens and changes in lifestyle including overt signs of progressive physical deterioration [2], legal and societal stigmas [3], [4], and possibly multiple bereavements [5]. Several studies found that adjustment disorder with depressed mood is very common among HIV-infected patients [6], [7], [8], [9]. Although HIV-infected persons may not be afflicted with clinical affective disorder, many of them experience significant levels of distress. Therefore, emotional adjustment is a major dimension of quality of life that is relevant to them.",

This definition implied that subjective perception is an important component of a person\u2019s quality of life. Among various dimensions of quality of life, the mental health aspect was found to be significantly improved among participants in the CBP group.

Three-month follow-up data was planned to be obtained from our sample initially. Unfortunately, there was an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong 3 months after the treatment. No follow-up data could be obtained to monitor the sustainability of treatment gain.",

            "text": "Findings of the present study suggest that time-limited group based interventions are feasible and effective among Chinese heterosexual HIV-infected men in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, two aspects of these men were observed to be rather different from the Western world. First, Chinese men usually place great values on family relationships. The disclosure of being HIV positive and the physical illness itself made them worry that they could no longer perform the role of caregivers in their families. This brought great impact on the macho image they used to hold. Strategies that help to redefine their roles and to adjust their expectation on themselves in the family would be beneficial to them. Second, Chinese generally tend to communicate their negative affects in terms of physical symptoms, such as chest discomfort, headache and stomachache. Additional time was required to educate and encourage our participants to express their emotions and to attribute signs of emotional distress more correctly.",

            "text": "In fact, our Chinese heterosexual men showed more similarities than differences when compared with their peers in the West. They share many common psychological impacts and challenges related to HIV infection. In the era of managed care and with the pressure to provide more time-limited treatments, it is important to learn that such treatments are effective and feasible in Chinese heterosexual men despite the few differences observed. Meanwhile, social support emerged to be a critical element in alleviating the psychological distress of our patients. They are often frustrated and angry about the stigma relating to AIDS. There is rarely any opportunity to ventilate their feelings and grief. A group based psychological treatment may specifically target such needs so that patients can openly discuss concerns and provide enhanced social support. It will be helpful for future research to employ process analyses to help us better understand the mechanism in the reduction of distress among HIV-infected men.",
