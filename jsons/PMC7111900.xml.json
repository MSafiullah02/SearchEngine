Wild bird surveillances of HPAI viruses during 2004\u20132007 in Thailand revealed that the HPAI viruses were detected in wild birds during the outbreaks and even after the goal of the eradication program in poultry had been accomplished in the area (Siengsanan et al., 2009).",

Such infections are thought to have occurred through ingestion of poultry meat or wild bird carcasses infected with the HPAI viruses (Amonsin et al., 2006, Keawcharoen et al., 2004, Songserm et al., 2006a, Songserm et al., 2006b). Human infections of the H5N1 HPAI virus in Thailand have also been reported (Chotpitayasunondh et al., 2005, Tiensin et al., 2005). In total, 25 human cases, 17 of which were fatal, have been reported during 2004\u20132006. Chotpitayasunondh et al. (2005) showed that most patients with HPAI had been exposed to infected poultry. These findings demonstrate sporadic interspecies transmission of the H5N1 HPAI viruses and imply that routine monitoring of not only poultries but also wild birds and domestic mammals is necessary for early detection as well as for preventing resurgence of the viruses.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that many patients infected with the H5N1 HPAI virus developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), lymphopenia, and multiple organ failure (MOF) (The Writing Committee of the World Health Organization Consultation on Human Influenza, 2005). Moreover, a typical finding in H5N1 infected patients is an aberrant level of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the serum (de Jong et al., 2006, Ka-Fai et al., 2001). de Jong et al. (2006) reported that levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IP-10, MIG, IL-8, IL-10, IL-6 and IFN\u03b3 in the serum of H5N1 infected patients increased significantly compared to those of H3N2 or H1N1 human influenza patients or healthy controls. It is noteworthy that serum levels of most of these cytokines in the fatal cases of H5N1 were significantly higher than those in the survivors; these phenomena correlated with the high viral load in pharyngeal specimens (de Jong et al., 2006). A high level of TNF\u03b1 expression in the pneumocyte of an H5N1-infected patient compared with a patient who died from a non-infective illness was reported (Peiris et al., 2004). Apoptosis was detected in alveolar epithelial cells or leukocytes in lung specimens of H5N1-infected patients (Uiprasertkul et al., 2007). In animal models, virulent H5N1 HPAI viral infection caused depletion of lymphocytes in the blood, lungs, and lymphoid tissues as well as apoptosis of lymphocytes in the lungs (Tumpey et al., 2000). Thus, apoptosis is thought to contribute to lymphopenia that is typically observed in H5N1 HPAI-infected patients (Korteweg and Gu, 2008, Tumpey et al., 2000).",

However, in China, unexpected H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in wild migratory waterfowls occurred at Qinghai Lake in 2005, and thousands of migratory birds were found dead due to the viral infection, suggesting that H5N1 HPAI viruses could cause fatal infections in wild birds (Chen et al., 2005). Very importantly, Gilsdorf et al. (2006) suggested that HPAI viruses were transmitted to humans following close contact or the process of de-feathering infected wild swans. There is report that these wild bird isolates were pathogenic to not only chickens but also mice (Chen et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2006). Songserm et al. (2006a) showed that a domestic cat was infected with an H5N1 HPAI virus due to eating a pigeon carcass infected with HPAI viruses in Thailand. HPAI viruses in wild birds have been suggested as possible potential threats not only to poultry but also to the public health of humans (Gilsdorf et al., 2006).",

One is a HPAI virus isolated from dead pigeon (Pigeon04), and the other is a HPAI virus isolated from live tree sparrow (T.sparrow05). Interestingly, these two HPAI viruses exhibited different levels of virulence in vivo in chickens and different growth properties in vitro in MDCK cells. In contrast, they showed similar replications in vivo in the lungs and brain of the infected mice, resulting in fatal outcome. Thus, to determine whether the differences of the replication profiles of two HPAI viruses between in vitro and in vivo were related to alterations of host gene responses in the lungs and brain infected with these two viruses, we compared host responses, particularly in host gene responses in the lungs and brain of mice infected with the two HPAI viruses.",

            "text": "We isolated two HPAI viruses from wild birds during routine surveillance during the outbreak of HPAI viruses in Thailand in 2004\u20132005. A/Pigeon/Thailand/VSMU-7-NPT/2004 (Pigeon04) was isolated from a dead pigeon in Nakhon Pathom province in 2004, and A/Tree sparrow/Ratchaburi/VSMU-16-RBR/2005 (T.sparrow05) was from a clinically healthy tree sparrow in Ratchaburi province in 2005. We determined nucleotide sequences of protein-coding regions of all eight gene segments of Pigeon04 (AB576199-AB576206). All eight gene segments of T.sparrow05 were also sequenced in this study to find a mix population (A/G) at position 415 in NS1 compared to the sequenced done by Uchida et al. This was submitted to the Genbank (AB576207). Pigeon04 and T.sparrow05 had more than 99% and 97% identities in nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene showed that these two viruses belong to clade 1 of the classification system (WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Evolution Working Group 2007) (Table 1\n, data not shown). The two viruses had similarly high infectivity titers in embryonated eggs and MDCK cells with titers, ranging from 7.6 to 7.9 log10EID50/mL and 7.1 to 7.2 log10PFU/mL, respectively (Table 1). Interestingly, the plaque size of the two HPAI viruses varied. Pigeon04 produced mostly pinpoint plaques, whereas T.sparrow05 produced medium to large plaques, indicating different growth properties in the cultured cells in vitro between the two viruses (Table 1). Therefore, to assess the growth properties of two viruses, we examined viral growth kinetics of these viruses in MDCK cells. As shown in Fig. 1\n, T.sparrow05 robustly replicated in MDCK cells on days 2 and 3 post-infection, and the mean virus titers were 7.8 and 8.2 log10TCID50/mL, respectively. In contrast, Pigeon04 replicated in MDCK cells to a less extent compared to T.sparrow05, and the titers were 6.5 and 6.1 log10TCID50/mL, respectively (Fig. 1). Thus, T.sparrow05 efficiently replicated in MDCK cells, compared to Pigeon04. To compare the lethalities of the two HPAI viruses to chickens, we performed a survival experiment involving the exposure of White Leghorn chickens to the HPAI viruses. All chickens were killed due to Pigeon04 infection by day 3 post-infection (Fig. 2A). In contrast, 5 of 7 chickens were killed by T.sparrow05 infection by day 4 post-infection, but 2 survived until day 10 post-infection (Fig. 2A). The mean death times of the chickens were 47 and 70 h post-infection after Pigeon04 and T.sparrow05 inoculation, respectively. All the uninfected control chickens survived throughout the observation periods. Also, we measured virus titers in the trachea and cloacal swabs of dead chickens infected with HPAI viruses. As shown in Fig. 2B, dead chickens shed both viruses in these swabs at high virus titers, but Pigeon04 was shed more than T.sparrow05 in the cloacal swabs. Therefore, these data showed that Pigeon04 could cause more lethality than T.sparrow05 in chickens.",

Pigeon04- or T.sparrow05-infected mice showed similar disease symptoms, such as ruffled fur, hunched posture and depression from day 6 post-infection. MLD50 of Pigeon04 and T.sparrow05 were 100.8 and 102.2 EID50, respectively, indicating that both viruses were highly pathogenic to mice, and Pigeon04 were more virulent in mice than T.sparrow05 (Fig. 3A and B, Table 1). Next, to examine viral distributions of the two HPAI viruses in the host, we measured virus titers in lungs, brain, spleen, liver and kidney of the infected mice inoculated with Pigeon04 and T.sparrow05 at a dose of 103.5 EID50 and 104 EID50, respectively, on days 3 and 7 post-infection. On day 3 post-infection, both strains replicated very well in the lungs, and mean virus titers of Pigeon04 and T.sparrow05 were 107.7EID50/g and 107.1EID50/g, respectively (Fig. 3C). Pigeon04 was also isolated from spleen, liver, and brain with the mean virus titers of 103.2EID50/g, 102.7EID50/g and 102.4EID50/g, respectively, whereas T.sparrow05 was isolated from spleen and kidney with titers of 104.1EID50/g and 102.6EID50/g, respectively (Fig. 3C). On day 7 post-infection, both viruses replicated robustly and similarly in the lungs, brain and spleen. The mean virus titers of Pigeon04 in lung, brain and spleen were 107.2EID50/g, 106EID50/g and 103.2EID50/g, respectively, and those of T.sparrow05 in these organs were 107.8EID50/g, 106.3EID50/g and 103.5EID50/g, respectively (Fig. 3D). Replication of the HPAI viruses in liver and kidney differed in mice infected with Pigeon04 or T.sparrow05. Pigeon04 was not isolated from liver, whereas T.sparrow05 was isolated with the mean virus titers of 103.7EID50/g from liver (Fig. 3D). Also, Pigeon04 was isolated with the mean virus titer of 103EID50/g, whereas T.sparrow05 was isolated with mean virus titer of 106.1EID50/g from kidney (Fig. 3D). These results clearly demonstrated that two HPAI viruses used in this study caused systemic and lethal infection to mice without adaptation. Thus, we compared the host responses in lungs and brains of mice infected with two viruses under conditions where both viruses replicated similarly in lungs and brains in the following study.",

            "text": "Among the 11 proteins between Pigeon04 and T.sparrow05, there are 21 differences in amino acids (Table 2\n). There are several differences in amino acids in the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, PB2, PB1, PA and NP, between the two viruses. Some of the changes in the amino acids are located in the functional domains of RNP that are essential for viral replication. Pigeon04 has residue 492-Ser in NP, whereas T.sparrow05 has residue 492-Asn. Recent studies suggest that C-terminal residues (490\u2013496) of NP contributed to the regulation of NP oligomerization, which are involved with the transcriptional function of RNP (Ng et al., 2008). Also, Pigeon04 has the residues 315-Met and 451-Val in PB2, whereas T.sparrow05 has the residues 315-IIe and 451-IIe. Amino acid domains between residues 318\u2013453 in PB2 are known as cap-binding domains which form a complex with m7GTP, followed by initiation of transcription by RNP (Guilligay et al., 2008, Tarendeau et al., 2008). It was suggested that these amino acid differences may affect the viral transcriptional function of those viruses. Therefore, it would be necessary to determine amino acid residues affecting its function using the techniques such as mini genome assay and reverse genetics analysis in the future. Both viruses possess 627-Lys and 701-Asn in PB2 which are well known as virulence determinants in mice. Other amino acid differences between the two viruses showed no significant correlation with known viral functions.",

First is the factor(s) that causes a difference in the responses of the host genes in Pigeon04 and T.sparrow05-infected lungs on day 3 post-infection. Viral distribution in lung tissue seems to be similar between the two viruses, suggesting that specific viral factors might contribute to the difference in host responses to the viruses (Fig. 3C). Specific amino acid substitutions of viral segments have been shown to be correlated with alterations in host cytokine responses after viral infection. A substitution of E627K in PB2 affects T-cell receptor activation of lungs in the early stages of viral infection, but it is not correlated with viral load (Fornek et al., 2009). Also, a substitution at P42S in NS1 has been shown to contribute to the antagonizing effect on antiviral cytokines, such as IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 in HPAI virus infection (Jiao et al., 2008). However, both viruses possess Lys at residue 627 in PB2 and interestingly serine at 42 residue in NS1, implying that these substitutions in PB2 and NS1 are not significant viral determinants for the alterations in host cytokine responses after viral infection that were observed in this study. One could suggest that other amino acid substitution(s) not previously recognized might be involved in the different host responses in mice infected with Pigeon04 and T.sparrow05. Also, synergetic or redundant functions of each viral determinant would be implicated in the pathogenesis of the HPAI viruses in mice.",

This was probably because Pigeon04 was unable to induce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs on day 7 post-infection because type I interferons (IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2) that were induced on day 3 post-infection induced potent inhibition of these cytokines. In contrast, T.sparrow05 could likely induce proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to a great extent in the lungs on day 7 post-infection as type I interferon was induced to a less extent in the lungs on day 3 post-infection. Smits et al. (2010) have demonstrated that type I interferon inhibited the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques. They showed that low levels of induction of type I Interferon (IFN\u03b2) opposed the high levels of induction of proinflammatory cytokines (IL6 and IL8) in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected aged macaques compared with those of SARS-CoV-infected young adult macaques (Smits et al., 2010). In addition, it was shown that treatment with IFN\u03b1 inhibited the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs of aged macaques infected with SARS-CoV (Smits et al., 2010).",

            "text": "Third is why host responses in brains differed between Pigeon04 and T.sparrow05-infection on day 7 post-infection. The viruses did not induce mRNA expression of cytokines on day 3 post-infection due to inadequate viral replication in the brains (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the potent induction of type I interferon in the lungs of Pigeon04-infected mice on day 3 post-infection may have inhibited cytokine induction in the brain as well as the lungs on day 7 post-infection. Our hypothesis would be supported by a previous study where IFN\u03b2 treatment inhibited the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain by inhibiting the proliferation and migration of Th1 cells to the central nervous system (CNS) though the blood\u2013brain barrier in patients with multiple sclerosis (Satoh, 2006). In addition, the avian H5N1 HPAI virus was reported to likely induce proinflammatory cytokines including IL6, IL1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 in mice primary glial cells such as microglia and astrocytes, and that the release of proinflammatory cytokines in CNS is involved with encephalitis (Wang et al., 2008), showing that other mechanisms could also be involved. As shown in Fig. 4G and H, both viruses were detected in cells which were considered as glial cells morphologically. The induction of type I interferon in the lungs of the infected mice on day 3 post-infection may have contributed to the inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokines in glial cells. Indeed, Aaron et al. reported that serum neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against IFN\u03b2 in multiple sclerosis inhibited the production of a proinflammatory cytokine (IL6) and IP-10 in human astrocytes, suggesting that the serum level of IFN\u03b2 affects cytokine production within the CNS (Shapiro et al., 2006). Monteerarat et al. (2010) reported strain-dependent induction of TNF\u03b1 in human macrophages by HPAI virus infections. Moreover, host response towards viral infection has been suggested to vary according to the type of cells infected with the virus. Further analysis of host cell- and strain-dependency for cytokine inductions by the HPAI viruses is essential.",

(2007) demonstrated that pre-treatment with glucocorticoids suppressed host cytokine response but did not significantly alter lethality of HPAI viruses in infected mice, even though host cytokine responses after viral infection were suppressed by the pre-treatment. This suggested that the exaggeration of inflammatory lesion caused by excessive cytokine inductions was not essential for a fatal outcome. Efficient viral replication at the early stage of the infection appeared crucial for the pathogenicity of the viruses. The presence of a particular cytokine(s), that is yet to be elucidated, at a certain level as well as pathological damage to the lungs caused by efficient viral replication in the lungs seem to be enough for viral infections to cause fatalities in mice. Host responses such as cytokine induction and pathological damage in T.sparrow05-infected mice were relatively delayed compared to Pigeon04-infected mice in the earlier phase of infection. The more severe inflammation observed in the brains of T.sparrow05-infected mice later in the infection likely enhanced virulence of the virus resulting in lethal outcome for mice infected with either virus. These findings suggest that T.sparrow05 is more neurovirulent than Pigeon04; however, further comparative investigation on neurovirulence of the two isolates is necessary.",
