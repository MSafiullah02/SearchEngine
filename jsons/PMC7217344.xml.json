The term \u201ccardiometabolic\u00bb had previously used by Pescatello in 1999 for obesity (13), by Sowers in 2001 for \u201cCM Syndrome\u201d (14), and by Vasudevan & Ballantyne in 2005 (15) for \u201cCM Risk\u00bb in two phases. Firstly, the term was used by Khan, Buse, Ferrannini and Stern in a symposium whose proceedings were never published. Fortunately, their conclusions were collected and valued as of great interest by other authors (Vasudevan & Ballantyne); they published them that same year (15) laying the groundwork for a new enlightened medicine. This medicine, the CMM, is much more eagerly, dynamic, open that the classical cardiovascular medicine, and at the same time much more predictive, preventive and anticipatory. To topping it all off, the CMM is the prototype of the modern \u201cPrecision Medicine\u201d, on which the American government spent so many millions in research during the last decade (16).",

ACE in vascular cells is expressed in the endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) independently; so, ACE in SMC, unlike the EC, is insulin-dependent (34) including the lymphatic system. On their behalf, its homologue ACE2 is expressed mainly locally (by the local RAS) with a low production by the systemic RAAS axis which include, unlike the local system, the aldosterone in the equation. ACE2 is one of the type-I integral proteins, expressed fundamentally at the cell surface as an ectoenzyme and is found at heart, kidney, small intestine, lung (type II pneumocytes), pancreas and liver among others. The expression of ACE2 in the endothelium and vascular SMC opens an unexplored pathway in subjects with COVID-19 who develop acute coronary syndromes. It had been demonstrated that in patients treated with RAS-blockers, the risk of atherothrombosis decreases. This could be explained because by dampening local A-II and vice versa, an over activated ACE2 could produce the opposite effect (35); this does not happen in older people, because they have ACE2 expression reduced in all organs in which it has been described, but especially at the vascular level (36). At both the systemic and vascular level, ACE2 acts as a buffer, so that Angiotensin-II does not rise excessively when its receptor is exogenously blocked. Therefore, ACE2 is a key counter regulatory enzyme that degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1\u20137), thereby attenuating its effects on vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and fibrosis. Although angiotensin II is the primary substrate of ACE2, that enzyme also cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin-(1\u20139) and participates in the hydrolysis of other peptides (28). Both ACEs uses Zn2+ and Cl\u2212 as cofactors for being metalloproteases (37). It could have therapeutic implications especially in people who use zinc as a nutraceutical (38).",

Firstly, HC and AZ induce inhibition of cardiac hERG/IKr (rapid IK) potassium channel, inducing mild QT prolongation, with subsequent risk of ventricular arrhythmia and even cardiac arrest, thus needing QT monitoring. Secondly, high doses of corticosteroids not only produce hyperglycaemia in patients, even in not diabetics (50), but also raise blood pressure and in many cases lead to hypokalemia, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. Other causes of non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, in many cases associated to corticosteroid administration would be high doses of loop diuretic, sepsis and very especially the enteral and parenteral nutrition (50, 51).",

            "text": "In aged COVID-19 patients or with history of coronary artery disease (CAD) an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can also be seen for plaque vulnerability in the presence of a pro-inflammatory state with cytokine release (71) but from the experience in animals, could it be plausible that any of them could be due to arteritis? As we already pointed out at the beginning of this paper, arteriviridae, of the order of Nidovirales (like the CoV), are responsible of equine viral arteritis (EVA) (72) a disease that has too many similarities with COVID-19. The main one is that both of them can present with interstitial pneumonia and the microscopic findings, included diffuse alveolar damage with exudates, lymphocytic inflammation and multinucleated giant cells, suggesting hyperactive macrophages, were seen alongside large atypical pneumocytes (51). In EVA\u2019s necropsies, antigens can be demonstrated not only within the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells, but also within endothelial, macrophages and cardiac myocytes (51), something has not been proven in COVID-19, at least not yet.",

(89) Surprisingly, there are extensive data showing, moreover, that latent persistent human cytomegalovirus infection is also associated with age-related immune dysfunction in the T cells, which might enhance immunosenescence. In this way, in the case of COVID-19, in older groups, a virus could be predisposing to another virus. (90) If we can still get even more surprised, both the endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy are involved in the process of immunosenescence (91).
