Polyesters are considered to be one of the most important classes of biomaterials [6]. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA), linear polyester, is extensively tested in medicine and tissue engineering, due to its biodegradability, non-toxicity and biocompatibility [7, 8]. PLA is a thermoplastic relatively easy to process. In addition, its mechanical properties are similar to commonly used synthetic polymers. Physicochemical properties of PLA depend on a stereoisomeric form of polymer [9]. Lactic acid (LAc), a repetitive unit of PLA, consists of two optical isomers: D(\u2212)LAc and L(+)LAc. Homochiral PLA is a semi-crystalline, isotactic polymer (PLLA and PDLA). Polymerization of D- and L-LAc mixture leads to the formation of heterochiral, atactic PLDLA with amorphous properties.",

It is required for scaffold to support regeneration of the tissue in the place of the defect and then degraded when the healing is completed. PLA could be easily made in various forms and shape, including microspheres and fibers with diameter that ranges from nanometers to micrometers. The main advantage of forming 2D and 3D fibrous scaffolds is a strong anisotropy of properties that allows to adapt material to specific requirements, a very high surface area, and the possibility of creating complex microstructures with specific pores and density [16]. Thanks to the ability to control the physicochemical properties of fibers; also through the degree of crystallinity, modifications of the volume and surface of the fibers, it is possible to modulate the biological response [17].",

The resistance to aging is a key factor for outdoor and medicine applications (packaging, stitches, bandage, sterilization). UV stability of PLA-based materials has attracted a lot of attention recently [21\u201323]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies in the literature regarding the influence of UV exposure on the properties of PLA nanocomposite fibers. We hypothesized that modification of fibers with inorganic particles (SiO2, ZnO and TiO2) can affect the stability of PLA. ZnO and TiO2 are effective absorbers of UV [24, 25] and are commonly used as UV-screen agents in sunblocks. Zhang reported that ZnO nanoparticles can stabilize poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene adipate) matrix and hinder the photodegradation of polymer [26].",

The SEM images were used to evaluate the quality (morphology and diameter) of obtained PLA fibers. All of the fibers had smooth and defect-free morphology. It was observed that ratio of solvent had a great influence on the fiber diameter (Fig. 2). Thinner fibers were obtained using ratio 2.5:1, regardless of the polymer concentrations. The other optimized parameter was gap between tip of needle and collector, and polymer concentration. As expected, the diameter of the fibers decreased with increasing needle-collector distance, as shown in Fig. 2a. This was due to the longer time that the solvents had to evaporate. Also, in most cases, increasing the polymer concentration resulted in obtaining fibers with increased diameters (Fig. 2b). Based on the SEM images, the following parameters were selected to obtain fibers modified with ceramic particles: concentrations of PLA\u201413%, gap between tip of needle and collector\u20145 cm, ratio of DCM and DMF\u20142.5 to 1.",

The parameters of process (concentration of polymers, gap between needle and collector, ratio of solutions) were optimized to obtain defect-free microfibers. It turned out that the chosen method is very sensitive to changing process conditions. The diameter of the fibers can be easily controlled by increasing the distance between the needle and the collector. The longer solvent evaporation time results in smaller diameter fibers. The addition well dispersed ceramic powders to PLA-based solution completely changed nature of the produced fibers. Ceramic materials, known as UV absorbent, were incorporated into polymer matrix to slow down the aging process. Stability of PLA is a key aspect for using this biopolymer as packaging material and in tissue engineering. The protective effect was noticed only for ZnO particles. The addition of ZnO significantly increased the proportion of crystalline and amorphous phases in the fabricated PLA-based fibers and changed the mechanism of the photodegradation. Similar impact was noticed in the case of TiO2 and SiO2. These additives significantly changed the microstructure of the nonwovens and accelerated matrix degradation. They caused cracking and breaking of fibers.",
