            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes avian infectious bronchitis (IB), a highly contagious disease that affects poultry worldwide and produces severe economic losses. The disease is clinically manifested by respiratory distress, drop in egg production, poor egg quality in layers and some strains causes nephritis (Cavanagh, 2003, Cavanagh, 2005, Mahmood et al., 2011). The disease may lead to loss of weight and predisposes to secondary bacterial infections that may be fatal (Cavanagh, 2003). Initially IBV infects the respiratory tract, however, infections of kidneys and oviduct may follow (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003). Also a shift of tissue tropism in the virus has been reported (Liu et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2004), resulting in infection of a wide range of avian host species especially those reared close to domestic fowl. For example, IBV cases were found in Chinese peafowl (Pavo), guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), partridge (Alectoris) and teal (Anas) (Cavanagh, 2005).",

The genome is positive-sense single stranded RNA of about 27.6 kb and contains 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs). The proximal two-thirds of the genome encode two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b that are translated into large polyproteins. These are then cleaved to generate 15 non-structural proteins (Nsp2-16), comprising a main protease, an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and other non-structural proteins that carry different functions in transcription and replication. The remaining third of the genome encodes four main structural proteins: the envelope protein (E), the spike glycoprotein (S), the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the membrane protein (M). IBV has two accessory genes 3 and 5 that express accessory proteins 3a, 3b and 5a, 5b, respectively. (Cavanagh, 2007, Pasternak et al., 2006).",

As a result, cross protection between serotypes is poor (Kuo et al., 2010) and changes as small as 5% in the amino-terminal half (S1) of the S protein have been shown to alter the protection ability of a vaccine (Cavanagh, 2003). The several different IBV variants are present around the globe some of them exist in particular region, while others are generally distributed (de Wit et al., 2011). The increasing number of new serotypes and genotypes of IBV is a major challenge for the prevention and control of the disease.",

Due to this situation a decision was made in 1997 to vaccinate with a live attenuated vaccine of Massachusetts (Ma) type IB Ma5. Vaccination reduced the frequency and seriousness of the outbreaks. Subsequent to introduction of vaccination, our study has found indications of outbreaks initiated by the vaccine virus (Farsang et al., 2002). Investigations as to the origins of IB cases during 2006 have shown presence of antibodies reacting with the 4/91 variant. In 2007 and 2008, the D388 variant of IBV was identified in chickens.",

It is unclear how the QX viruses spread to Europe. There were more cases of QX-like virus infection with presentation of nephritis rather than proventriculitis, and false layers in mature hens reported from Belgium, China, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Russia, Taiwan and UK (Ammayappan and Vakharia, 2009, Beato et al., 2005, Bochkov et al., 2006, Worthington et al., 2008, Zhou et al., 2004). Similar type of IBV isolates has been reported in Israel and Korea (Meir et al., 2004, Park et al., 2005). A QX-like strain in chicken associated with nephritis, rare proventriculitis and mortality was reported in Poland in 2006 (Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2006).

There is a possibility that trade and import of day old chicks and poultry products from other European countries or indirect routes may have contributed to the spread of the QX-like strains in Sweden. The role of wild or migratory birds in dissemination of the IBV new variants still remained unclear. However, previous studies on other coronaviruses and IBV in wild birds have indicated a potential role of wild birds in dissemination of various coronaviruses, including IBV in Europe (Gough et al., 2008, Muradrasoli et al., 2010).",
