Centralization and modernization of microbiology services has already taken place in some countries (e.g. the UK and Germany) or is being considered by a range of healthcare regions and countries. Current trends include concentration of resources (formation of larger microbiological units from the closing of smaller laboratories), amalgamation of services (creating multidisciplinary laboratory facilities), outsourcing of microbiology diagnostics, automation of sample handling and diagnostics, mandatory accreditation, and broadening microbiology staff competencies in order to improve the flexibility of the available workforce.4 These encompass specimen reception, decontamination services, cleaning, ordering, secretarial work, blood science support and even mortuary duties, the latter an unwelcome addition for inexperienced laboratory assistants.",

There is little awareness of the impact from loss of rapid testing, altered communication patterns, aspects of specimen timing and transport factors, all of which threaten the safety of patient care, as well as complicating infection prevention and control. Any potential benefits from financial savings, cross-cover options and a greater number and array of possible tests cannot necessarily compensate for deterioration in service quality. Sadly, many managers do not really understand what microbiologists do and how quickly they can do it in the event of an emergency.5 It is also true to say that there is minimal scientific or other evidence to justify decisions on service amalgamation.1 Here we summarize some of the potential consequences of centralizing microbiology services in the UK and beyond.",

There is little evidence to justify a hot facility at the present time, and indeed its creation may lead to unforeseen health and safety issues, as well as problems with out-of-hours cover and governance (http://www.britishinfection.org/professional-affairs/csc-mvd/).1 Should there be significant distance between peripheral and central laboratories, however, then it is reasonable to consider a restricted service capable of processing selected microbiological tests (see Box 1\n).

Managers should be aware that there is still a need for incubators; manual and/or automated susceptibility testing systems; blood culture equipment; anaerobic culture; safety cabinet and containment facilities for processing expected and unexpected controlled pathogens. All laboratory facilities, whether peripheral/hot or central, remain subject to health and safety standards, spillage containment, waste disposal, appropriate decontamination, and quality control and inspection in accordance with regulatory frameworks. In such circumstances, an acute hospital should campaign for retention of the original facility, given the lack of evidence for financial benefit from replacing it with a hot laboratory; laboratory staff could, however, undertake to liaise and work with the larger/central laboratory to enhance services. Strong support from senior clinicians such as intensivists and oncologists may assist in maintaining on-site diagnostic services.

Formal reporting would itself be compromised by increased specimen load, as well as difficulties in locating a specific result following a request for clinical advice.1 Even a few hours of additional delay in processing may be critical for a septic patient or for identifying or controlling an outbreak. Furthermore, centralized laboratories make it infinitely more difficult to share specimens between laboratory disciplines on the same site, e.g. blood submitted to biochemistry or haematology cannot easily be retrieved for urgent microbiology, such as antibiotic assays.",

Both options present a number of challenges: data retrieval from abandoned data base(s) and loss of years of microbiological data for individual patients, units, specialties, and surveillance programmes. Clinical microbiologists rely heavily on past microbiological histories in order to manage acutely unwell patients. Previous reports of specific pathogens and associated antibiogram assist greatly when advising on empirical therapy.

Contractual visits to both sites fragments the working day and week, complicates communication, wastes time, and often reduces job satisfaction.
