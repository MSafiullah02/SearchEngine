Database searches of dinoflagellate transcriptomes and genomes yielded hits with sequence features diagnostic of all confirmed H V 1, and show that H V 1 is widely distributed in the dinoflagellate phylogeny including the basal species Oxyrrhis marina. Multiple sequence alignments followed by phylogenetic analysis revealed three major subfamilies of H V 1 that do not correlate with presence of theca, autotrophy, geographic location, or bioluminescence. These data suggest that most dinoflagellates express a H V 1 which has a function separate from bioluminescence. Sequence evidence also suggests that dinoflagellates can contain more than one H V 1 gene.",

            "text": "BIOLUMINESCENCE in dinoflagellates takes place in subcellular structures known as scintillons (Hastings and Dunlap 1986; Johnson et al. 1985; Nicolas et al. 1987a,b; Schmitter et al. 1976 ). Scintillons contain the biochemical machinery (luciferase enzyme, luciferin, and luciferin-binding protein) for bioluminescence (Desjardins and Morse 1993; Fogel and Hastings 1972; Hastings and Dunlap 1986; Lecuyer et al. 1979; Morse et al. 1989) , while nonbioluminescent dinoflagellates lack these molecules (Valiadi and Iglesias-Rodriguez 2013) . In response to mechanical stimulation, the vacuolar membrane of bioluminescent dinoflagellates experiences an action potential (Eckert and Reynolds 1967) , most likely propagated by protons (Nawata and Sibaoka 1979; Rodriguez et al. 2017) . In 1972, J. Woodland Hastings and colleagues proposed that a voltage-gated proton channel in the tonoplast of the bioluminescent species Lingulodinium polyedrum responds to the action potential and conducts protons from the acidic vacuole into the scintillon lumen, triggering the light reaction at pH < 7 (Fogel and Hastings 1972) . This hypothesis was confirmed recently when LpH V 1, a bona fide H V 1 proton channel identified in L. polyedrum, was shown to localize to scintillons (Rodriguez et al. 2017) .",

The exquisite proton selectivity of H V 1 arises from a critical Asp in S1 (Chaves et al. 2016; Musset et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2011 ) that interacts with one or more arginines in S4 (Dudev et al. 2015; Kulleperuma et al. 2013) . H V 1 opens with depolarization but both internal and external pH strongly influences its voltage dependence such that a 1 unit change in pH gradient (\u0394pH = pH o \u00c0 pH i , where pH o is external pH and pH i is internal pH) shifts the conductance-voltage (g H -V) relationship by 40 mV (Cherny et al. 1995) . The three-dimensional structure of the H V 1 protein (Takeshita et al. 2014) shows cytoplasmic and extracytoplasmic aqueous vestibules separated by a narrow hydrophobic region identified as the gating charge transfer center (Tao et al. 2010 ).",

In contrast, like all other experimentally verified H V 1, the threshold voltage of L. polyedrum H V 1 (LpH V 1) is positive to the reversal potential (Rodriguez et al. 2017) . A simple explanation for this difference might be that kHv1 represents an isoform with a unique function. However, the experimentally verified LpH V 1 is in Group 3, as is kH V 1. This observation makes the simple explanation unlikely and the molecular basis of kH V 1's unique characteristics remains mysterious.",

(A) Maximum likelihood tree of high-confidence dinoflagellate H V 1 sequences shows three major sequence subfamilies (Group 1 in blue, Group 2 in gray, Group 3 in brown). Chromerid and diatom sequences are indicated in black. Yellow shading indicates bioluminescent species; @ indicates autotrophic species; italics indicates nonthecated species; boxes indicate sequences found in genomic data; gray highlighting indicates two distinct sequences found in the same genome. Matching symbols indicate sequences in different subfamilies found in the same species. Asterisks indicate alRT-SH branch support > 0.8. (B) Two-dimensional depiction of kH V 1 sequence produced by TOPO2. Extents of transmembrane helices were defined as in DeCoursey et al. (2016) . Red indicates proton selectivity filter on S1, blue indicates arginines involved in voltage sensing on S4. Brown indicates specificity determining sites as identified by SPEER analysis. (C) Sequence logos from the three main subfamilies. The trimmed multiple sequence alignment that was submitted to maximum likelihood analysis (tree shown in A) was separated into three alignments corresponding to Group 1 (top), Group 2 (middle), and Group 3 (bottom) and a sequence logo was obtained for each subfamily. Black bars indicate the extent of transmembrane helices S1-S4 as defined in (B); numbers indicate beginnings and ends of transmembrane helices in kH V 1. Note that the trimmed alignment contains only well-conserved sequence positions and does not reflect the full length of the VSD. Brown circles indicate specificity determining sites as identified by SPEER analysis. Red circle indicates proton selectivity filter on S1, and blue circles indicate arginines involved in voltage sensing on S4. sustained calcification (Taylor et al. 2011 ). In several cell types from multicellular organisms, H V 1 is important for controlling cytoplasmic pH (DeCoursey, 2013) . It is thus likely that H V 1 also contributes to pH homeostasis in dinoflagellates. This function could be critical to the survival of these ecologically important producers in an acidifying ocean (Bopp et al. 2013 ).",
