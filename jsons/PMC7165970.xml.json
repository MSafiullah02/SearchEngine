To protect themselves from pathogenic effects of these invaders, organisms have been required to develop mechanisms to detect and prevent viral infection. In higher mammals, this requirement has evolved the adaptive immune system, which is able to generate highly specific antibodies and T cells that recognize specific viral proteins and peptides that either block infection or target infected cells for destruction. Initiation of the adaptive immune response, however, is a slow process that requires days to weeks for maximum effect. To provide protection during the initial hours and days of infection, we have maintained a system of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) first seen in lower organisms that recognize broad motifs common to viral pathogens and thus serve as the initial sensors of viral infection. These sensors serve to initiate and maintain an antiviral response while the more specific adaptive response develops.",

Viruses can have genomes composed of double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA), single\u2010stranded RNA (ssRNA), or DNA and can replicate at different locations in the cell through different mechanisms that proceed through unique intermediates. Designing a system that can broadly detect all of these possibilities is challenging to say the least. To accomplish this, organisms use a variety of sensors from two main classes: Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I)\u2010like receptors (RLRs). These sensors protect different cellular compartments and signal through different adaptors to activate an antiviral response.",

There are currently three known members of this family: RIG\u2010I, melanoma differentiation\u2010associated gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology\u20102 (LGP2) (1). Both RIG\u2010I and MDA5 contain a DExD/H box helicase domain that binds dsRNA and two N\u2010terminal caspase recruitment (CARD) domains involved in signaling (2, 3, 4, 5). LGP2 contains the helicase domain but lacks the CARD domains and is thought to be a negative regulator (6, 7). Both RIG\u2010I and LGP2 also contain a C\u2010terminal repressor domain that blocks signaling in the absence of ligand binding (5). RIG\u2010I binds preferentially to ssRNAs that are phosphorylated at the 5\u2032\u2010end (8, 9) and contain homopolyuridine or homopolyriboadenine motifs as well as short dsRNA (10, 11, 12). MDA5 recognizes long dsRNAs and does not require 5\u2032\u2010phosphorylation (11, 12, 13, 14). The differences in ligand preferences of the two proteins result in specificity for the recognition of individual viruses, which is discussed later.",

Both MDA5 and RIG\u2010I signal through CARD\u2013CARD interactions with interferon\u2010\u03b2 (IFN\u2010\u03b2) promoter stimulator 1 (IPS\u20101) [also known as mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), virus\u2010induced signaling adapter (VISA), or CARD adapter\u2010inducing IFN\u2010\u03b2 (Cardif)], which is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane (15, 16, 17, 18). Downstream of IPS\u20101 (19), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor\u2010associated factor 3 (TRAF3) activates TANK \u2010binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5), which phosphorylate IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF\u20103) and IRF\u20107 (20, 21). Activated IRF\u20103 and IRF\u20107 translocate into the nucleus and bind IFN\u2010stimulated response elements (ISREs), inducing the expression of type I IFNs (22). IPS\u20101 also interacts with FAS \u2010associated death domain (FADD)\u2010containing protein (23). FADD activates caspase\u20108 and caspase\u201010, and the activation of the caspase death effector domains activates NF\u2010\u03baB, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines (24). Thus, MDA5 and RIG\u2010I appear to activate both the IFN and inflammatory responses.",

There are 10 members of the TLR family in humans and 13 in mice. TLRs involved in the detection of viral nucleic acids are located on the cell surface (TLR3) or in endosomal compartments (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) (25). TLR3 recognizes dsRNA, which constitutes the genome of dsRNA viruses and is also an intermediate produced during replication of ssRNA viruses (26). TLR7 and TLR8 recognize ssRNA as well as imidazolequinilone compounds, which are known to have antiviral properties (25, 27, 28, 29, 30).

TRAF3 leads to the secretion of type I IFNs, while TRAF6 and RIP1 lead to NF\u2010\u03baB activation and production of inflammatory cytokines (38). TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 signal through the adapter protein myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88). MyD88 contains a TIR domain as well as a death domain that allows it to serve as an adapter for TLR signaling. MyD88 associates with a signaling complex consisting of TRAF6, Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK), IL\u20101 receptor\u2010associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), and IRAK1 (39). Signaling through this complex activates IRF7, NF\u2010\u03baB, and mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase pathways (40, 41, 42). Thus, although RLRs and TLRs signal through different pathways, both appear to be able to activate the production of type I IFNs (i.e. IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b2) and inflammatory cytokines.",

Recently, the array of innate immune sensors of viral infection has been shown to include two additional cytosolic proteins that are involved in the recognition of DNA viruses. A DNA\u2010binding protein, named DNA\u2010dependent activator of IFN\u2010regulatory factors (DAI), Z\u2010DNA\u2010binding protein 1 (ZBP1), or DLM\u20101, binds cytosolic DNA, inducing type I IFN and other genes involved in innate immunity (45, 46). Accordingly, RNA interference of mRNA for DAI in cells inhibits DNA\u2010mediated antiviral responses. Furthermore, Nacht domain\u2010, LRR\u2010, and PYD\u2010containing protein 3 (NALP3), a component of the cytosolic molecular complex termed the inflammasome, has been shown to recognize adenoviral DNA, inducing activation of caspase\u20101 and maturation of pro\u2010IL\u20101\u03b2 in macrophages (47). Correspondingly, mice lacking NALP3 or its signaling adapter, apoptosis\u2010associated speck\u2010like protein containing a C\u2010terminal caspase (ASC), display reduced innate inflammatory responses to adenovirus particles. The discovery of these sensors has provided further insight into the innate response against DNA viruses.",

It is proposed that 2\u2032,5\u2032\u2010linked oligoadenylate generated by viral infection activates RNase L to cleave self\u2010RNA into small RNA products, which are responsible for RLR signaling. However, it is not yet known how these small self\u2010RNAs are recognized by MDA5 and RIG\u2010I. PKR has been shown to dimerize upon binding of dsRNA. The activated PKR dimer phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u2010a (eIF2\u2010a), which results in the inhibition of translation, preventing viral replication (49). Like RLRs, RNase L and PKR are upregulated in response to type I IFN, demonstrating their important role in the preprogramed antiviral response.",

Type I IFNs fight viruses both directly by inhibiting viral replication in cells and indirectly by stimulating the innate and adaptive immune responses. IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b2 bind to the IFN\u2010\u03b1 receptor (IFNAR) in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Activation of this receptor leads to Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signal transduction pathways (50, 51). These genes increase the cellular resistance to viral infection and sensitize virally infected cells to apoptosis (52). Interestingly, several viral sensors are among those genes induced by IFN. They in turn enable the production of IFN, creating a positive feedback loop that creates a local cellular response. In addition, type I IFNs directly activate dendritic cells (DC) and natural killer (NK) cells and promote the survival and effector functions of T and B cells, providing a link between the innate response to infection and the adaptive immune response (53, 54, 55, 56).",

The current paradigm is that RIG\u2010I recognizes RNA\u2010containing 5\u2032\u2010triphosphates, while MDA5 recognizes dsRNA. Therefore it is not surprising that RIG\u2010I has been shown to detect influenza A and B viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and some flaviviruses (Japanese encephalitis virus and hepatitis C virus) (13, 60, 61). Likewise, MDA5 detects picornaviruses such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Mengo virus, and Theilers virus (13, 14) as well as caliciviruses (62). These viruses contain a 5\u2032\u2010VPg cap instead of 5\u2032\u2010triphosphate and make large amounts of dsRNA during replication. However, other results do not neatly fit this paradigm. RIG\u2010I and MDA5 play redundant roles in the recognition of West Nile virus (63), Dengue virus, (61) paramyxovirus, and reovirus (61), most of which contain 5\u2032\u2010triphosphates. In addition, although Sendai virus has been shown to activate RIG\u2010I, it encodes for a protein, the V protein, that is a specific inhibitor of MDA5 (64). Furthermore, murine hepatitis virus, a member of the coronavirus family that does not contain VPg, has recently been shown to be recognized by MDA5 (65). One explanation is that, although RIG\u2010I preferentially recognizes 5\u2032\u2010triphosphates and polyuridine\u2010rich regions, it can also recognize short dsRNA, while MDA5 recognizes long dsRNA (11). The ability of MDA5 and RIG\u2010I to specifically detect certain viruses while also detecting common pathogens illustrates the need for multiple sensors to recognize and control the wide variety of viral pathogens.",

However, in one study TLR3 did not contribute to viral pathogenesis in VSV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and reovirus infections (72). To make matters more confusing, TLR3 has been implicated in recognition of DNA viruses. TLR3\u2010deficient mice are more susceptible to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection than wildtype mice (73). Moreover, a recent human study has demonstrated that a dominant negative form of TLR3 causes susceptibility to neonatal herpes simplex\u20101 encephalitis (HSE) (74). However, it is unclear why TLR3 plays such a major role in HSE, whereas it has no obvious role in other HSV\u20101 infections, such as skin, eye, or mouth infections, or sepsis or in other DNA virus infections.

In human cDCs, this occurs in an MDA5\u2010 and TLR3\u2010dependent manner, leading to the production of IFN\u2010\u03b2, autocrine activation via IFNAR, and the production of IFN\u2010\u03b1. In pDCs, however, TLR3 is not present, MDA5 and RIG\u2010I may not be functional, and autocrine secretion and activation via IFN\u2010\u03b2 does not occur, but high levels of IFN\u2010\u03b1 are produced (87). This occurs because pDCs utilize TLR7 and TLR9 and express endogenously high levels of IRF7 (22), which primes them for IFN\u2010\u03b1 production. In this situation, we can see that by varying the expression of TLRs and signaling components, different cell types have unique ways to detect pathogens. Extending this observation, a recent study demonstrated that human neutrophils respond to polyI:C through the RLR pathway rather than the TLR3 pathway (88).",

It has been demonstrated that MDA5 and RIG\u2010I are the predominant sensors for polyI:C and RNA virus infection in bone marrow\u2010derived DCs, macrophages, and fibroblasts. However, TLR3 has also been shown to play a role in different cell types. This may occur as a result of differential expression of the various sensors or their downstream adapter proteins. One specific example may occur in the brain. Several groups have shown that TLR3 is expressed in the brain, while MDA5 does not appear to be expressed. Most probably, this differential expression of the various viral sensors contributes to their importance in viral infection.",

Further studies are necessary to determine which of these possibilities most contributes, as well as the role of the individual sensors in viral infection in vivo.",

This figure illustrates the detection of viral products by retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I)\u2010like receptor (RLR) and Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) family members. TLR3, TLR7/ 8, and TLR9 are located on endosomal compartments in which they sense their double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA), single\u2010stranded RNA (ssRNA), and CpG DNA ligands, respectively. TLR3 signals through the adapter protein Toll/interleukin\u20101 (IL\u20101) receptor (TIR) domain\u2010containing adapter\u2010inducing interferon\u2010\u03b2 (TRIF), which activates tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor\u2010associated factor 3 (TRAF3) (not shown) and the TANK\u2010binding kinase 1 (TBK\u20101) complex leading to interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 7 (IRF\u20107) activation and IFN signaling. TRIF also signals through TRAF6, which leads to nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) activation and inflammatory cytokine production. TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 signal through the MyD88 adapter. MyD88 signals through a protein complex consisting of TRAF6 and IL\u20101 receptor\u2010associated kinase 1/4 (IRAK1/4) (not shown), leading to the activation of type I IFN and NF\u2010\u03baB signaling. RLR family members, melanoma differentiation\u2010associated gene 5 (MDA5), retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I), and laboratory of genetics and physiology\u20102 (LGP2), are cytoplasmic proteins that detect viral products within the cytosol. MDA5 and RIG\u2010I signal through IFN\u2010\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS\u20101), which is located on the mitochondrial membrane. IPS\u20101 signals through TRAF3 and the TBK\u20101/inhibitor of NF\u2010\u03baB kinase \u03b5 complex to activate IRF\u20103 and IRF\u20107 and then type I IFN. IPS\u20101 also signals through FAS\u2010associated death domain\u2010containing protein (FADD) leading to the activation of caspase\u20108 and caspase\u201010 (not shown), which causes NF\u2010\u03baB activation and inflammatory cytokine production. LGP2 does not signal through IPS\u20101 and is considered to be a negative regulator of RIG\u2010I.",
