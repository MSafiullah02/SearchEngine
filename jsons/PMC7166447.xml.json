To avoid cross\u2010contamination, all pre\u2010PCR processing was under taken in a separate location from PCR and post\u2010PCR analysis. For all PCR assays, standard precautions to avoid amplicon and nucleic acid contamination were taken. All samples were tested individually adding 5 \u00b5l nucleic acid to 45 \u00b5l master mix. Each reaction mix contained 200 pmol of each primer, 200 \u00b5M of dNTPs, 1\u00d7 PCR buffer, and 2.5 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). PCR assays were performed on a GenAmp PCR System 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). Samples were subjected to 1 cycle of 94\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 56\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension of 5 min at 72\u00b0C. Negative controls were included in each experiment. Samples were initially analyzed using the LT PCR assay described by Feng et al. [2008]. Plasmid pGEMT, containing Large T antigen of MCPyV (kindly provided by Dr. Vincent Foulongne, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France) was also used as a positive control. Amplified products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel, visualized with ultraviolet (UV) light and compared for size with E\u2010Gel Low Range Quantitative DNA Ladder (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). A strongly positive MCPyV sample (5 \u00d7 107 molecules/\u00b5l DNA copies) was used as a positive control in subsequent experiments (VP1 PCR assay). To confirm the results, all positive specimens were subjected to a second PCR analysis using primers targeting a different genomic region of MCPyV [VP1 PCR assay; Feng et al., 2008]. Using tenfold serial dilutions of positive controls, the sensitivity of the LT PCR and VP1 PCR were determined as 1 copy/\u00b5l and 50 copies/\u00b5l, respectively. Positivity was defined as being definitely established when the results of both PCR assays agreed.",

We considered a sample as positive, when both PCR assays produced positive results. The prevalence reported here could therefore be an underestimate. Similar discordant LT and VP1 positive MCPyV results have been reported [Feng et al., 2008; Bialasiewicz et al., 2009; Goh et al., 2009]. This variation in detection rates could have been due to non\u2010specific amplification in the LT PCR or to the lower sensitivity of the VP1 PCR assay. Sample cross\u2010contamination is unlikely, because the samples were collected over 2 years from different hospitals. Contamination by the plasmid template is also unlikely because water controls were consistently negative and both assays were easily reproducible.",

A relatively high co\u2010infection rate (30%) with other respiratory viruses was observed in this study. Several alternate respiratory pathogens including rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and enterovirus were not tested and thus the proportion of co\u2010infections is possibly higher. MCPyV was however, the only virus detected in some children with evidence of respiratory tract disease, and so it is still possible that the respiratory system could be a primary target for MCPyV and that this virus contributes to respiratory tract disease in susceptible children.",

Both groups had either lower or upper respiratory disease. Both immunocompetent (2.4%) and of immunocompromised (7.27%) groups were found to be MCPyV positive. The positive samples in the immunocompetent group were children age ranged 26 days\u20137 months. In fact, all 6 MCPyV positive patients who were not immunocompromised were <1 year of age suggesting early acquisition of MCPyV. Also, a patient aged 26 days was found to be MCPyV positive perhaps suggesting a potential vertical transmission route for MCPyV from mothers to infant. We could not however, determine whether this baby's mother had viral infection and whether the baby had viraemia. In the immunocompromised group, all four MCPyV positive patients were in an older age group (41\u201369 years). Higher rates of MCPyV detection in elderly immunosuppressed patients in the present study suggests an association between MCPyV and altered immune status and may mirror a similar pattern to the reactivation of BKV and JCV seen in leukemia and in transplant patients [Behzad\u2010Behbahani et al., 2004]. Examination of samples from control groups of patients without respiratory disease that are immunocompetent and immunosuppressed may shed further light on the association of MCPyV with disease. Further studies concerning the role of MCPyV in respiratory disease and the pathogenesis of MCPyV and its relationship with immunosuppression are clearly warranted.",
