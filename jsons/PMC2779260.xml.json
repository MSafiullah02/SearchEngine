The poxvirus family is composed of two subfamilies: the Entomopoxvirinae, comprised of viruses that infect insects, and the Chordopoxvirinae, comprised of viruses that infect vertebrates. Both subfamilies are further divided into genera, groups of viral species with genetic and antigenic similarity to one another. Chordopoxviruses are categorized into 9 genera: Avipoxvirus, Capripoxvirus, Cervidpoxvirus, Leporipoxvirus, Molluscipoxvirus, Orthopoxvirus, Parapoxvirus, Suipoxvirus, and Yatapoxvirus. Entomopoxviruses are categorized into the genera Alphaentomopoxvirus, Betaentomopoxvirus, and Gammaentomopoxvirus. The genus Orthopoxvirus is the most well characterized, and contains the species Variola virus, isolates of which are the causative agent of smallpox, as well as the species Vaccinia virus, containing less virulent but better studied viruses.",

Unlike most viruses, poxvirus virions do not rely on particular cell surface receptors, but are capable of binding and penetrating the outer membrane of nearly any cell type. Virion cores are released into the cytoplasm where they immediately synthesize early mRNAs that are translated into growth factors, cell signaling and immune defense molecules, enzymes, and other factors necessary for DNA replication and intermediate transcription. Uncoating of the core next allows the DNA genome to be replicated to form concatemeric molecules along with the transcription of intermediate genes that when translated, provide late transcription factors. Subsequent transcription and translation of the late genes produces virion structural proteins, enzymes, and early transcription factors for packaging into virions (Moss, 2001). During virion formation, the concatemeric DNA genomes are resolved into individual genomes, packaged into the core membranes, and mature within the cytoplasm to form infectious mature virions (MV). These are subsequently wrapped in modified Golgi membranes and transported to the periphery of the cell via attached actin filaments. Fusion of the wrapped virions with the plasma membrane results in release of enveloped virus (EV) (Condit et al., 2006).",

Their resulting genetic stability, together with their high levels of host specificity have led in part to the hypothesis that many DNA viruses cospeciate with their hosts (DeFilippis and Villarreal, 2001). Intricate relationships with their hosts are evidenced by the many immunological and cellular factors these viruses have obtained through host gene capture via recombination between viral and host DNA. Such acquisition of new coding information by poxviruses may contribute to the ability of the virus to manipulate the host immune response and other cellular machinery to provide a selective advantage for virus replication.",

Understanding species crossing events of both types is essential to understanding the threats poxviruses pose today.

Recombination may be an important source of genetic variation among viruses, where it is often associated with rapid evolutionary divergence, due to the potential of providing a selective advantage much more quickly than through the accumulation of point mutations. Recombination has been detected in both DNA and RNA viruses including species of the families Caulimoviridae, Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picornaviridae, Potyviridae, Poxviridae, Polyomaviridae, Retroviridae, the genus Tobamovirus, and bacteriophages in the order Caudovirales (DeFilippis and Villarreal, 2001).

            "text": "Acquisition of host genes and apparent selection for maintenance of those genes has been documented in many virus families (Iyer et al., 2001, McFadden and Murphy, 2000). Many of the apparently host-derived genes fall into one of two well-defined categories of gene function: immunomodulatory genes and genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism. Viral proteins that are very similar to host genes are documented to interfere with a variety of host immune defense mechanisms including antigen display, cytokines and their receptors, cytoplasmic signaling resulting from immune activation, and genes involved in resistance of cells to oxidative stress and apoptosis (Hughes and Friedman, 2005, Shackelton and Holmes, 2004). Many DNA viruses encode genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism, with which they redirect the host nucleotide precursor pool to viral DNA synthesis (Iyer et al., 2006). These enzymes are often clearly similar to host enzymes, and are often very highly conserved, probably due to functional restraints on structure and biochemical properties. There are many additional, possibly host-derived genes, whose functions have not yet been fully explored, but based at least on similarity to other proteins, seem to manipulate various intracellular processes to facilitate steps in the viral life cycle. Examples of these are genes involved in signaling pathways, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, vesicle transport, and protein\u2013protein interactions (Afonso et al., 2000, Geserick et al., 2004, Laidlaw et al., 1998, Werden and McFadden, 2008).",

These include phylogenetic inference, compositional features such as codon and nucleotide bias, and patterns of presence and absence of genes within genomes. A well accepted and widely used method to detect horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is demonstration of phylogenetic clustering of the gene of interest with taxa unrelated to the current genome in which the gene is found, to the exclusion of taxa more closely related to the current genome. This method provides information about the potential donor and recipient organisms, but its potential caveats include limited phylogenetic samples, undetected presence of paralogs, and unequal rates of evolution between lineages (Katz, 2002). Compositional features that may be used to detect recently horizontally acquired genes include nucleotide composition, oligonucleotide frequencies, and codon usage (Koonin and Wolf, 2008), but these methods work only for very recent HGT because the anomalous signatures of such genes decay rapidly due to continued evolution of the host genome (Katz, 2002, Koonin and Wolf, 2008, Monier et al., 2007), and these methods do not give information about the donor lineage (Katz, 2002). Presence of a gene within only a related subset of a taxonomic group is a possible indicator of HGT if apparent orthologs of the gene are present in unrelated taxa.",

No significant differences were obtained. (Table S1 provides a list of downloaded protein groups used for analysis.)\u2022The set of all proteins predicted to be encoded by poxviruses, and subsets of this set, were used to query individual taxonomic databases using NCBI command line blast version 2.2.15.\u2022The single best BLASTP hit (based on BLAST bit score) for each query protein against each database was identified. Query proteins that gave low scores against each taxonomic database and would therefore be plotted, along with every other insignificant hit, near the origin of the graph, were removed from the analysis. The threshold for exclusion from the analysis was usually a bitscore of less than 60 with an E value of 10\u22125 or larger.\u2022Results for each query protein were plotted on two-dimensional graphs with axes corresponding to mutually exclusive taxonomic databases. This allowed visual comparison of the query set's relationship to one taxonomic group to its relationship to another taxonomic group. This was done with a custom Java applet.\u2022Normalization of bitscores using alignment length, or use of other measures such as percent identity or similarity, did not significantly change the results.\n",

RNR class 1 is made up of large (RNR1) and small (RNR2) subunits, with two of each subunit required to associate into a heterotetramer to form a functioning enzyme (Stubbe, 1990). Both subunits are very well conserved in all major taxonomic groups in which RNR type I appears: eukaryotes, eubacteria, bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses. The large subunit of RNR (RNR1) is present in orthopoxviruses and suipoxviruses, while the small subunit of RNR (RNR2) is present in most chordopoxviruses. For both subunits, the percent identities between queries and highest scoring hits are between 80% and 90% percent similarity, with such high levels of sequence conservation likely due to the stringent structural requirements the enzyme must maintain in order to function (Torrents et al., 2002). Although many chordopoxvirus species encode only the small subunit, it is probably functioning in association with host-encoded RNR1, based on the finding that even RNR subunits from vastly different species can associate to form heterotetramers (Hamann et al., 1998).",

A good candidate for further study is IL-10, presumably of eukaryotic origin, but with several apparently homologous proteins among poxviruses and herpesviruses. A phylogenetic reconstruction of several viral and host IL-10 sequences is provided in Fig. 2B. Analysis of the phylogenetic relationship between these proteins suggests the possibility of several independent IL-10 HGT events between hosts and infecting viruses. Three HGT events are suggested into different lineages of herpesviruses, and two separate HGT events are suggested for poxviruses, with one each into the capripoxvirus and parapoxvirus lineages.

X94355) in Fig. 4\ndepicts all cowpox virus genes color coded according to the degree of similarity of each cowpox virus protein to its best hit when compared against all virus (non-poxvirus) or all eukaryotic proteins. Genes and their descriptions are provided in Table 2\n. Genes are labeled by their restriction fragment name and are colored according to the highest blastp bitscore obtained by the encoded poxvirus protein when searched against the respective taxonomy database. Bitscores are normalized by dividing by the highest possible bitscore the query protein could achieve, i.e. the bitscore it receives when compared to itself. Therefore the highest possible score for each comparison is 1. The map demonstrates the higher levels of similarity poxvirus proteins have to eukaryote proteins in comparison to virus proteins outside the poxvirus family. In addition, it is apparent that with only a few exceptions, poxvirus proteins with high levels of sequence identity to proteins of other organisms tend to lie towards the edges of the linear genome. Exceptions include S2R: thymidine kinase, L4L: ribonucleotide reductase large subunit, R2L: glutaredoxin 1, and E8L: carbonic anhydrase (virion protein).",

Anomalous base composition (DaSilva and Upton, 2005, Monier et al., 2007), and gene synteny analysis (Bratke and McLysaght, 2008, McLysaght et al., 2003) have found evidence for HGT from hosts to poxviruses, including multiple HGT events for some genes. All methods of analysis conclude that the presence of many genes is best explained by HGT, although the process may not be frequent and recent (Lefkowitz et al., 2006, Monier et al., 2007), and some genes with noted similarity to genes of other organisms are proposed to not have been obtained via HGT (Hughes and Friedman, 2005, Iyer et al., 2001).",

This analysis was designed to detect overall trends in gene similarity and to detect individual genes that may be of interest due to anomalous characteristics with regard to such levels of similarity. Each individual protein may then be further investigated with regard to its function, distribution in poxviruses and other organisms, and via phylogenetic analysis, to determine its most likely evolutionary history. Proteins identified as interesting candidates for follow-up research by this method may be further studied using more traditional phylogenetic methods as illustrated by our initial phylogenetic analyses of proteins in Fig. 2. Overall trends in sequence similarity of different subsets of poxvirus proteins, as well as information about individual proteins implicated by our analysis may contribute valuable information about the evolution of poxviruses and the mechanisms of host pathogenesis.",

Although entomopoxviruses also contain host-like genes, both with and without homologs in chordopoxviruses, entomopoxvirus proteins do not show the same general skew towards similarity to eukaryotic proteins. However, entomopoxviruses encode quite a few proteins with notably greater similarity to proteins of other viruses than to bacterial or eukaryotic proteins. The relatively small sampling of insect proteins available in GenBank could partly account for the low scores of these proteins to the eukaryote database, with insects being represented by 799,971 proteins and 210 complete genomes, compared to a vertebrate collection of 1,787,682 proteins and 1559 complete genomes. However, with only 3 exceptions, all chordopoxvirus proteins which achieve similarly high scores to proteins of other viruses are proteins with sequences universally conserved throughout nature, such as ribonucleotide reductase, DNA photolyase and RNA polymerase. For viruses of both the entomopoxvirus and chordopoxvirus subfamilies, the most similar virus proteins outside the poxvirus family are found both among members of the postulated NCLDV group of viruses and among non-NCLDV members, with viruses of the families Baculoviridae, Herpesviridae and Iridoviridae most represented.",

All the poxvirus enzymes that convert cellular pools of nucleotides for RNA synthesis into deoxyribonucleotides for synthesis of DNA fall either on the diagonal or just below it. The ultimate origin of these proteins is uncertain, but those with greater similarity to eukaryote proteins may have been transferred more recently into the poxvirus lineage than into the other virus families in which they appear, or these proteins may have been constrained for functional purposes towards high sequence identity with host proteins.",

For example, the fact that the poxvirus versions of universally highly conserved enzymes such as RNR have significantly more sequence similarity to RNR of eukaryotes than to those of bacteria or other viruses may imply a need for interoperability of the poxvirus enzymes with host proteins. Another example is the presence of different clusters of poxvirus TK sequences, where TK encoded by entomopoxviruses and avipoxviruses cluster together on the plot in a different location from the cluster of TK proteins encoded by poxviruses in other genera, agreeing with previously published suggestions that the TK enzymes of avipoxvirus, entomopoxvirus and the other chordopoxvirus genera may have different origins (Bratke and McLysaght, 2008, Koonin and Senkevich, 1992).",
