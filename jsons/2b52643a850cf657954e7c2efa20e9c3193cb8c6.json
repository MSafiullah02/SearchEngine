Besides the source of this virus, it is also important to understand how different virus-variant change their frequency in time, because this may indicate different levels of aggressiveness, or provide useful data to trace the spreading of the virus in the population. In this work we trace 6 amino acid variant that have high frequency in Italy and Europe, but were absent or very low frequency during the first explosion in China and the initial diffusion in Europe. One of these, variant D614G in the Spike protein, appears in Germany on January 28 and since then has overcome the wild-type variant arrived from China.",

            "text": "The worldwide fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus during the first months of this year has caused 198,668 deaths with more than 2,878,196 confirmed cases since the first reports of novel pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province, China [1, 2] up to the 27 th April 2020 [3] . The virus belongs to the beta-coronavirus, being the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans, which causes severe respiratory and systemic disorders [4] , with a basic R0 index ranging from 1.4 to 6.49 [3] . Closest viral relatives of SARS-CoV-2 circulate in animals, either bat or pangolins [5] , suggesting that an animal virus jumped species boundaries to efficiently infect humans through multiple passage in intermediate animal hosts, that has not been yet identified to date [6] . Traces of the history of the spread are hidden in the viral genome and comparative genomics approaches has been therefore used to understand how viruses can adapt to multiple hosts, uncovering which are the key signatures of this adaptation [7] , and to trace back the infection routes of the virus. At the same time, genomic studies can help tracing viral variants that might be geographically restricted and/or might account for different levels of infectivity and mortality in humans. These variants might arise during the spread of the viru as a consequence of natural selection and the use of antivirals. Viruses are indeed known for their high frequency of mutation, particularly in single stranded RNA viruses, as in the case of SARS-CoV2 [8] , which has a single, positive strand RNA genome. In general, the aplotypes present at the very beginning of the infection change progressively; sometimes novel variants can overcome the ancestral ones, and this can be a consequence of different levels of aggressiveness but also of a founder effect. Indeed, if one considers different variants as identical in terms of their ability to infect and replicate in the host, switches in aplotype frequency can be explained by a mechanism whereby the major aplotype in a country depends on the very first viruses that arrive in that country. However, if aplotype frequency changes globally, then the hypothesis of differential aggressiveness becomes probable, indicating those variants that might be better adapted to infect the human hosts. Alternatively, the rising of continuous new variants, particularly in those genes coding for structural protein, might help the virus evading the immune response, challenging the human immune system with novel epitopes. Here, we performed a comprehensive study of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients from Italy during the entire course of the pandemy, comparing their genomes to those isolated in the rest of the world. Italy was the first European country registering not-imported COVID-19 cases with severe outcome and requiring hospitalization: the first case of COVID-19 was registered on February 20, 2020; he was a young man in the Lombardy region in the north of Italy with an atypical pneumonia [9] . In the next 24 hours there were 36 more cases, with anyone having previous clear contact with somebody known to have COVID-19. From that moment up to 27 th April 2020, Italy registered 197,675 cases with 26,644 deaths, one of the highest in Europe and in the entire world. WHO classifies the transmission occurring in Italy as ?Community Transmission?, that is a country experiencing large outbreaks of local transmission with no clear transmission chains between the cases, and with multiple unrelated clusters of transmission [3] . To have a better insight in the COVID-19 pandemic history and spread in Italy, we identified 6 non synonymous mutations that differentiate Italian Sars-Cov-2 strains and the strains globally present in the world, by making use od the gisaid database and we traced their relative frequency in time both globally and in different countries.",

After the comparison, the coordinates of the alignment were used to cut from the genome the nucleotide sequences aligned with the protein queries. Nucleotide sequences were then translated, manually controlled for the presence of frameshifts, and manually curated as explained below. Sequences with a high fraction of gaps or Ns were removed (the extent depended on the length of the alignment under analysis, on average sequences with more than 5% gaps or Ns were eliminated), aligned using the translated sequence, and then partitioned into two groups: strains from Italy and all the strains (comprising italian ones). Multialignment were manually edited to remove sequences not well aligned or too partial, resulting in a different number of sequences per alignment. This manual curation resulted in alignments with a minimum number of 2262 sequences for ORF3a and a maximum of 5585 sequences for the Nucleocapsid protein, with an average of 4222 sequences per alignment. We are aware that by removing sequences with gaps we could remove part of the variability that resulted in indels. However, we did not observe indels with such a frequency to make it thinking we are in the presence of some real signal, therefore we think that we are removing more noise than genuine signal. Additional analysis with high quality genome sequences are necessary to ensure this. However, this does not change the results of our analysis as the target of this work is on point mutations.",

The Spike variant D614G was sequenced for the first time in Germany, on January 28, 2020 and since then has increased rapidly in frequency, overcoming the ancestral aplotype. It was also sampled in China on 6 and 7 February 2020 in Shangai and Wuhan, respectively. The remaining variants do not have such a clear shift in frequency, excepted for a Leucine in position 4715 in the Polyprotein that increases rapidly starting from the beginning of March after several weeks of stable frequency. Interestingly, by calculating the covariance of the variants ( Figure 5 ) we observe a relatively high mutual information among variant Spike D614D and Polyprotein P4715L which may suggest some form of structural interdependence and therefore a functional meaning for these variants. However, a bibliographical search on known Spike proteins did not reveal any mutagenesis experiment where this position was tested. For what concern the two sites on protein N, we find a perfect agreement among the profiles, strongly suggesting that these two mutations happened together. Indeed, the observed pairs of amino acids at these sites over the total sequences used here are: KG (relative frequency, r.f.= 0.00036) , KR (r.f.= 0.12500) and RG (r.f.= 0.87464) indicating that the two variants at these sites behave like a single variant as there are basically not the pairs KG and RR. We reasoned that the frequencies in sequences uploaded by different countries may somehow provide an average picture of a situation that is instead variable in different countries. We therefore derived time profiles for countries represented by more than 25 sequences in Gisaid.org ( Figure 4 ). Differently from previous analysis, the time series are based on sequences downloaded on April, 28. We show here only a selection of countries concerning the Spike variant, see Supplementary Material for complete figures concerning all countries and all variants. We also provide a movie of changes in variant frequencies day by day (Supplementary Figures 1-6 ). The data in the plot indicates that this variant was not sequenced in China, despite the availability of 182 sequences predating the first appearance of this variant in Germany on January 28, 2020, corresponding to the only sequence available in that time window in Germany, explaining the value 1 at the beginning of the time series). Since then D614G has raised in frequency more or less rapidly in different countries, most of the time overcoming in abundance the ancestral variant, except for China (where it is present at very low frequencies) and United Kingdom, where the two variants are coexisting at similar percentages since several weeks. At first glance, a similar pattern might suggest that some of these variants have higher fitness than the ancestral one; for this reason, we performed a thorough bibliographical record looking for functional information associated to these positions or the domains they belong to.

It is a thought to be a highly flexible and intrinsically disordered region (IDP) of the protein. While the mutation R203K is a conservative mutation in terms of charge and size of the residue side chain, G204R introduces a bulky charged residue in place of a G residue.

Position 265 belongs to non-structural protein 2 (Nsp2, corresponding in this protein to residue 85) which is characterized by four transmembrane helices (TH) [18] but whose role is still unknown. More in detail position 85 lies at the N-terminal, which protrudes from the external face of the membrane. Interaction analysis of the corresponding protein from SARS virus shows that Nsp2 can form dimeric or multimeric complexes that can also involve additional viral proteins (Nsp3, Nsp4, Nsp6, Nsp8, Nsp11, Nsp16, ORF3a) [19] suggesting that Nsp2 might be involved in the viral life cycle. Nsp2 also interact with host proteins, such as prohibitin 1 and 2 [20] , that are involved in cell cycle progression, migration, differentiation, apoptosis and mitochondrial biogenesis [21, 22, 23, 24] . Murine Hepatitis Virus and SARS-CoV strains deleted in this portion of the polyprotein [25] have a strongly reduced viral growth and RNA synthesis, but not protein processing. Ectopic expression of the nucleotide sequence coding for Nsp2 in murine cell infected by strains with Nsp2 deleted, allowed to detect its recruitment in viral complexes.

Nsp2 seems to be present in infected cells in small vesicular foci, but in absence of additional viral proteins it localizes in cytoplasmic or nuclear membranes, without a specific target [26, 19] . Unfortunately, mutagenesis experiments are still not available, and therefore we still don't know if the variant observed at this site has any effect on in vivo virus properties. Position 3606 belongs to Nsp6, a protein that induces the formation of autophagosomes, as happen to cell due to starvation, but in greater number and lower diameter [27] . Autophagosomes can act as an innate defense against viral infection but they can promote the assembly of coronavirus replicase proteins [28, 29, 30] . Together with Nsp3 and Nsp4, Nsp6 moreover promotes the formation of the double membrane vesicles typically observed in SARS disease [31] . Nsp6 is a protein with 7 transmembrane domains [32] and position 3606 lays in the luminal loop between the first and second hydrophobic transmembrane domains. In the wild type Sars-CoV-2 sequence, we find 3 Phenylalanine residues just before position, where we find a Leucine. Instead, variants have a stretch of 4 Phenylalanine, which should increase hydrophobicity of this regions. Position 4715 belongs instead to the N-terminal domain of the RNA-directed RNA Polymerase (RdRp, comprised in Nsp12). By exploiting a three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of SARS-CoV RdRp [33] it was shown that this protein has the canonical palm and finger structure plus a N-terminal domain whose function is unclear. Through structural modelling with additional viral RdRps it was shown that the N-terminal domain bridges the fingers to from a channel through which nucleotides may diffuse. In poliovirus, the N-terminal part of the RdRp is involved in the proper folding of the fingers and the positioning of the active catalytic site and it may be supposed that the function is conserved in SARS coronaviruses [34] . This is also supported by the impossibility to correctly fold RdRp in vitro without expressing the N-terminal sequence [35] . Thus, despite no information is available concerning mutations at the specific sites identified in this work, the three variant sites in the polyprotein belongs to important and functional regions of the sequence.",

The tree clearly shows the existence of well-defined groups. When integrating the information about the residues found in each sequence at each of the six sites, we demonstrate that these clades correspond to the five most frequent combinations of residues for our 6 variable positions, i.e. RGTLPD, RGTFPD, KRTLLG, RGTLLG and RGILLG (where residues are given in the order: protein Nucleocapsid sites 203, and 204, Polyprotein sites 265, 3606 and 4715, Spike site 614) and as they are perfectly correlated with the tree, in the following we will call them for simplicity Clade A, Clade B, Clade C, Clade D and Clade D, respectively. A graphical visualization of the distribution continents of each variant and of the five clades is reported in Figure 8 and Figure 9 , respectively. Furthermore, the variation of the distribution of the six sites independently, and clades over time is shown in Supplementary Video S1 and S2. Figure 7 and Figure 9 show a clear geographic pattern : while Clade A and Clade B are more associated to Asia and Oceania, the remaining three are more frequently observed in Europe, in agreement with the single variant analysis. Considering that the epidemic event began in Cina and taking into account the topology of the tree, we can infer that the Clade A clade is the ancestral one while the Clade B evolved from it in a second moment. In Europe, the Clade C and Clade D are sampled since the beginning while the Clade E evolved from a strain carrying a configuration RGTLLG (corresponding to Clade D). In order to evaluate how the clades prevalence evenness changes over time in these macro-regions, we computed the Shannon index of the clades cumulative frequency over time (Figure 10 ). We found that the Shannon index values increase over time in all the continents, reaching a plateau in April, meaning that after an increase in variability in all macro-regions, the virus seems to be relatively stable at the moment. This could also be interpreted as an indication of reaching a optimized variant, but the information on variant performance will only be available in the future to confirm or confutate this hypothesis. The reached plateau index values vary among continents and the Sars-CoV-2 Oceania population resulted to be the most even in comparison to the others, indicating coexistence of several variants at comparable frequencies.",

In Asia, the Shannon index increases in a stepwise-manner at the appearance of every new variant. We can hypothesized this low value could be due to the fact that most of the genomes are from strains isolated in China, the country that for first started the lockdown, reducing the spread of novel clades. This analysis is however based on cumulative frequencies, while it does not take into account the disappearance of variants in time. To explore this issue, we also calculated the Shannon index for sequences within the same intervals of times used to track the change in frequency of the single residue variants. Peaks indicate the emergence (from outside or by evolution of pre-existing strains) of variants and their increase in frequency. Values maintaining a high Shannon index correspond to situations where different variants coexist at comparable frequencies, while a decrease after a peak means that after the appearance of one or more new variants / clades, one of them (novel or old) takes overreducing the variability.

This suggest that the characterization of these six positions can represent a fast and portable method for the Sars-Cov-2 typing.
