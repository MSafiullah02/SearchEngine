As of April 2020, there is still no vaccine or approved therapeutic to treat this disease. Here we examine the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope spike (S) protein that mediates host cell infection, with a specific focus on the extent to which glycosylation masks this virus antigen from the host immune response. Viral envelope proteins are often modified by the attachment of complex glycans that can account for up to half of the molecular weight of these glycoproteins, as in HIV gp120 (2) . The glycosylation of these surface antigens helps the pathogen evade recognition by the host immune system by cloaking the protein surface from detection by antibodies, and can influence the ability of the host to raise an effective adaptive immune response (3, 4) or even be exploited by the virus to enhance infectivity (5) . Additionally, because the virus hijacks the host cellular machinery for replication and subsequent glycosylation, the viral glycan shield may be composed of familiar host glycans; thereby suppressing an anti-carbohydrate immune response (6) .",

Over time, the protein sequences in viral antigens undergo mutations (antigenic drift), which can alter the species specificity of the virus (9), modulate its infectivity (10) , and alter the antigenicity of the surface proteins (11) . These mutations can also impact the degree to which the protein is glycosylated by creating new or removing existing locations of the glycans (glycosites) on the antigens (12, 13) . Varying surface antigen glycosylation is thus a mechanism by which new virus strains can evade the host immune response (12) , and attenuate the efficacy of existing vaccines (8) .",

It is well established that there is a strong dependence of both the composition and relative glycan abundance (glycan microheterogeneity) on the cell type used for glycoprotein production. And there is a large body of data relating to the influence of host cell line on viral envelop protein glycosylation. For example, a glycomics analysis of influenza A virus produced in five different cell lines, all of relevance to vaccine production, led to the observation of profound differences in the compositions of the glycans at a given site; with structures varying from paucimannose (Sf9 cells) to core-fucosylated hybrid with bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (Egg) to sialylated biantennary glycans (HEK293) (19) . For these reasons, we have modeled the S glycoprotein with reported site-specific glycosylation (16) , as well as hypothetical homogeneously glycosylated glycoforms of the high mannose (M9), paucimannose (M3), biantennary complex (Complex) and core-fucosylated biantennary complex (Complex Core F) types.

We subjected the five glycoforms of the CoV-2 S glycoprotein to MD simulation and interpreted the results in terms of the impact of glycan structure on the theoretical S glycoprotein antigenic surface area ( Figure 1 , Supplementary Figure S1 , Table 1 ). A series of 3D structure snapshots of the simulation were taken at 1 ns intervals and analysed in terms of their ability to interact with a spherical probe based on the average size of hypervariable loops present in an antibody complementarity determining region (CDR) (Figure 3 ). The percentage of simulation time each residue was exposed to the antibody accessible surface area (AbASA) probe was calculated and plotted onto both the 3D structure ( Figure 1 ) and sequence ( Figure 2 ). The average AbASA over the course of the simulations was also calculated for each glycoform and compared to non-glycosylated protein (Table 1 ). Supplementary Table S1 for details). The protein surface is colored according to antibody accessibility from black to red (least to most accessible). Images generated using Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) (32) version 1.9.3.",

In contrast, the largest high mannose N-linked glycans (M9), which corresponds to the nascent glycoform that would exist prior to processing through the Golgi apparatus, led to the highest level of surface shielding (47%). The level of cloaking offered by the two types of complex glycans are not significantly different from that of M9 at 45-47% surface shielding. Glycosylation based on the S glycoprotein produced recombinantly in HEK293 resulted 42% of the surface being shielded from antibody recognition; a value that is comparable to that for the models based on uniform M9 or Complex glycans. There is a strong correlation (R 2 = 0.98) between the total molecular weight of the glycans and the net shielding of the protein surface, however it is notable that the glycans disproportionately block the accessibility of the surface to the antibody probe. This result is indicative of the high density of the glycans on the S glycoprotein surface.",

Nevertheless, differences in glycosylation may impact other structural features, such as local interactions between the glycan and the protein surface, or local structural fluctuations in either the protein or glycan conformations that are only partially captured by the exposed surface area analysis. A visual examination of the glycoform 3D structures (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1 ) indicates that the most exposed epitopes comprise the ACE2 receptor site, specifically the apex region of the S1 domain when that domain is in the open conformation. The large extent of RBD exposure is quantified in Figure 2c . Moreover, the extensive motion displayed by each glycan illustrates that no single static model could fully capture the extent of glycan shielding. It can also be observed that a ring of antigenic sites appears to encircle the S1 domain, independent of glycoform. Unlike the extremely high level of glycan shielding in gp120 that challenges HIV vaccine development (34, 35) , the level of shielding by glycans in the S protein is more moderate, with approximately 42% of the surface potentially inaccessible to antibodies.",

Beyond a role in shielding the underlying protein from recognition by antibodies, the glycans on pathogenic proteins may also attenuate the ability of the host immune system to raise antibodies against any epitopes that include the glycan. In a T-cell dependent adaptive immune response, peptides from the pathogen are presented on antigen presenting cells by major histocompatibility complex II molecules, known as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes. HLA complexes have preferred peptide motifs, and based on a knowledge of these preferences it is possible to predict which peptides in a protein are likely to be HLA antigens (36, 37) . However, when that peptide contains a glycosylation site, the ability of the peptide to be presented by an HLA may be compromised, if for example the peptide cannot bind to the HLA molecule due to the steric presence of the glycan. However, glycopeptides may be presented in HLA complexes if the glycan is small enough (38) or if it is found on the end of the peptide antigen where it doesn't interfere with HLA binding (39) . The glycan-mediated shielding of predicted HLA antigens (Supplementary Table S2 ) derived from the S protein are shown in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 for all HLA peptide sequences that also contain a glycosite.",

Of the 18 glycosites in the 3D structure, 16 are predicted to be present in HLA peptides. Although the glycans may occur throughout the HLA sequences (Supplementary Table S2 ), in 12 of these sequences the glycans are predicted to be present at the terminus of at least one putative HLA antigen. This observation suggests that these 12 glycosites may not interfere with antigen presentation in an HLA complex. This property is essential for the potential generation of antibodies against the underlying epitopes, but moreover, may lead to antibodies that target these carbohydrates on the S glycoprotein (38) . Anti-carbohydrate antibodies have been shown to be neutralizing in other viruses, such as HIV (40) , and therefore glycosylated peptides can offer an alternative to more traditional peptide epitopes. Targeting glycans as epitopes is most effective when the glycans or their clusters are significantly different from self, and thus are not immunologically tolerated (6) . Although viruses exploit the host glycosylation machinery in their biosynthesis, differences from host glycan distributions can occur when for example the virus cloaks itself so densely in glycosites that the glycans are not accessible to glycan processing enzymes, due to steric crowding, and remain in their high mannose form (17) . Examples of this are seen in the high-mannose clusters in some strains of influenza (17) and in HIV (41). were not included in the 3D structure due to a lack of relevant template structures.

The S glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 share a high degree of structural similarity, with an average root-mean-squared difference (RMSD) in the C\u03b1 positions of only 3.8 \u00c5 (14) . The MERS S glycoprotein also shares a similar trimeric structure with CoV-1 and CoV-2. From this alignment, the extent to which epitopes in the CoV-2 S glycoprotein might be inaccessible to known antibodies on the basis of structural differences in the glycoproteins or due to shielding by glycans on the CoV-2 S glycoprotein surface was inferred (Figure 3 ). Approximately 50% of the corresponding epitopes in the CoV-2 S glycoprotein are blocked by glycans from antibody binding, and only areas of the protein surface at the apex of the S1 domain appear to be accessible to known antibodies. Although this static epitope analysis doesn't take into account the plasticity of the glycans or the protein it does confirm that the RBD in the CoV-2 S glycoprotein should be accessible for antibody recognition, consistent with the analysis of the MD simulation data. present on SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein that are incompatible with known antibody positions due to steric overlap are shown in yellow. c.

This suggests that although glycan microheterogeneity varies according to host cell type, the efficacy of antisera should not be impacted by such differences. In contrast, by analogy with influenza hemagglutinin (57, 58) , variations in glycosite location arising from antigenic drift can be expected to have a profound effect on S protein antigenicity and potentially vaccine efficacy. Fortunately, the most accessible and largest epitope in the S protein consists of the ACE2 binding domain, where the virus cannot exploit glycan shielding or mutational changes to evade host immune response without potentially attenuating viral fitness. The requirement that the virus maintain the integrity of the ACE2 RBD suggests that a vaccine that includes this epitope may maintain efficacy despite antigenic drift, as long as the virus continues to target the same host receptor.",

Given that in humans, glycan microheterogeneity varies between individuals, and depends on many factors, including age (59), underlying disease (60, 61) and ethnicity (62) , access to 3D models of the S glycoprotein may aid in defining the molecular basis for the differential susceptibilities among individuals to COVID-19.",

A series of 3D structure snapshots of the simulation were taken at 1 ns intervals and analysed in terms of their ability to interact with a spherical probe based on the average size of hypervariable loops present in an antibody complementarity determining region (CDR) (Figure 3 ). The percentage of simulation time each residue was exposed to the AbASA probe was calculated and plotted onto both the 3D structure ( Figure  1 ) and sequence ( Figure 2 ). The average AbASA over the course of the simulations was also calculated for each glycoform and compared to nude protein ( Table 2 ). To estimate the AbASA, a spherical probe was derived (radius 7.2 \u00c5, smaller sphere) that approximates the average size of the hypervariable loops from four anti-gp120 antibodies, in which the epitopes were either protein surface residues (PDB IDs: 2B4C (73), 2NY7 (74), 1G9M (75)) or both carbohydrate and protein residues: (3TYG (76)). This probe size may be compared to values of 5 and 10 \u00c5 employed previously to estimate antigenic surface area (77) . Changes in the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) showed no shielding by glycans and thus a simple SASA model was not useful for this analysis (77) . Additionally, to account for the presence of the beta-sheet framework in the antibody variable fragment (Fv), we introduced a second larger probe (18.6 \u00c5) sufficient to approximately enclose that domain. The antigenic surface area is then defined as sum of the surface areas of any protein residues that make contact with the CDR probe, provided that the CDR probe is proximal to the Fv probe. This latter requirement is governed by \"L\", which requires that the distance between the CDR-antigen contact site and the Fv probe surface be less than the length (10.4 \u00c5) of the longest CDR loop in mAb PGT128. PGT128 was chosen for this reference as it contains a particularly long CDR loop that penetrates the glycan shield of gp120. Images generated with UCSF Chimera (78) .",
