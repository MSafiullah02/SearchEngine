In some isolated cases, the virus was found to have been transmitted from animals to human beings. In 2005, the World Health Organisation, WHO, urged caution, since the virus could mutate into a stain more easily transmissible to human beings. As a result, some countries advised their citizens to avoid all-but-essential travel to infected areas. This study seeks to identify the impact of the 2004\u20132006 avian flu epidemic on international elderly tourism to Asian countries. It focuses on the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1:\n",

In the past when people tried to minimise face-to-face contacts, demand in the service sector, and especially in tourism, fell. Older tourists tend to spend more and stay away longer when travelling and represent a key market segment for analysis. However, as the WHO indicated in its 2005 study, age is a risk factor in the contracting the flu. Consequently, when governments issued travel alerts during the bird flu outbreak, this sector of the tourism market should have been negatively affected.",

We assume that the elderly tourists were from Asian countries, just as of the majority of inbound tourists. Hypothesis 1, therefore, is proven, since there seems to have been little apprehension among Asian nationals to visit other countries within the continent even in the height of bird flu (WHO, 2005).",

It therefore seems extraordinary that the numbers of elderly tourists who visited Asia in 2005, at the height of bird flu fears, were not drastically affected. It appears that most tourists were convinced that the low fatality rate did not merit the cessation of travel.",
