            "text": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent, pathogen-associated microbial pattern (PAMP) released by Gram-negative bacteria. LPS is recognized by the TLR4-myeloid-differentiation-factor-2 (-MD2) complex through hydrophobic interactions [1]; its recognition activates two downstream pathways: the myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway and the TIR domain-containing adaptor protein-inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF)-dependent pathway [2], [3], [4], [5]. Recent evidence suggests that TLR4 signaling can also be activated by several non-LPS TLR4 ligands; a cell-wall skeletal component derived from Mycobacterium sp. and OK-432 derived from Streptococcus sp. [6] induce TLR4-mediated innate and acquired immune responses through NK and T-cell activation. In addition, increasing numbers of proteins that are TLR4 ligands have been identified [7]. For example, a 55-kDa protein isolated from the parasitic plant Aeginetia indica\n[8], the Escherichia coli fimbriae H protein [9], and the heat shock proteins Hsp60 and Hsp70 [10], [11] have all been recently proposed as TLR4 ligands [12].",

Anionic \u03b3-PGA molecules with various molecular weights are produced and secreted by Bacillus species such as Bacillus subtilus (natto), a strain producing the traditional Japanese fermented food \u201cnatto\u201d, and B. subtilus sp. Chungkookjang, a strain used for the production of a transitional Korean fermented seasoning made from soybeans [13]. This biodegradable, non-toxic microbial polymer has been used as a delivery agent for therapeutic proteins, protein vaccines, and anti-tumor drugs [14], [15]. \u03b3-PGA was also shown to activate immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes, and induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interleukin-1 [16], [17]. It was proposed that this in vivo activation of immune cells by \u03b3-PGA is mediated by the TLR4-MyD88 signaling pathway. Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated the prophylactic effectiveness of intra-nasally administered \u03b3-PGA against the influenza virus in mice [18]. The details, however, of how \u03b3-PGA activates TLR4 and possibly induces the type I interferon (\u03b1 and \u03b2) response have not yet been investigated.",

            "text": "TLR4 is known to require multiple cofactors, including LPS-binding protein, MD2, and CD14, to respond to LPS [12]. CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein found on the surface of many TLR4-expressing cells [28]. CD14 interacts with various ligands including a variety of microbial products such as LPS [29], [30], [31], [32] and peptidoglycan [33]; synthetic molecules such as the negatively charged, high-molecular weight nucleic acid poly(I:C) [34]; and CpG DNA [12], [35]. We hypothesized that the TLR4 cofactors MD2 and/or CD14 may be required for \u03b3-PGA to activate TLR4 and subsequent type I IFN responses. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed the ability of \u03b3-PGA to activate the IFN-\u03b2 promoter using a luciferase reporter plasmid carrying the binding site of IRF-3, a transcription factor activated by Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) upon TLR4 stimulation [4], [5], [36]. We used the HEK293hTLR4 cell line stably expressing human TLR4, because the parental cell line HEK293 does not express TLR4 [37]. Moreover, other accessory molecules required for TLR4-mediated LPS sensing are deficient in HEK293 cells, making them unresponsive to LPS [37]. HEK293hTLR4 cells were thus transfected with sets of plasmids expressing either MD2, or CD14, or both, along with the reporter plasmids for the INF-\u03b2 promoter assay. After treating the transfected cells with 100 \u03bcm of 2000-kDa \u03b3-PGA for 30 h, we performed a dual luciferase-activity assay. As shown in Fig. 1\n, \u03b3-PGA led to activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter in a CD14-dependent manner. Expression of CD14 alone increased the promoter activity by 35%, whereas expression of MD2 alone failed to trigger the promoter activation. This result suggests that CD14 may act as a PRR for \u03b3-PGA. Co-expression of MD2 with CD14 further increased the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity by up to 84%, which is comparable to the response induced by 200 ng/ml LPS. This result underscores the critical role of MD2 in the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway.",

The degree of IRF-3 dimerization was comparable to that induced by HCV 3\u2032-UTR transcripts containing 5\u2032 terminal triphosphate and poly-U/UC region, which is known to activate IRF-3 by being recognized by cytosolic retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) [25].

We tested whether the TLR4/MD2/CD14-mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction by \u03b3-PGA was dependent on the molecular weight of \u03b3-PGA. We measured INF-\u03b2 promoter activity, as described above, in cells treated with \u03b3-PGAs with average molecular weights of 1, 5, 50, 500, 2000, and 5000 kDa, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2\nA, we observed significant enhancement of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity only in cells treated with \u03b3-PGAs with average molecular weights of 2000 kDa or greater. We also confirmed this molecular weight dependence by observing increased levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNAs in HEK293hTLR4 cells transiently expressing both MD2 and CD14 (data not shown). Consistent with the reporter assay, \u03b3-PGA with a molecular weight of 2000 kDa resulted in the greatest IFN-\u03b2 induction, as assessed by ELISA; whereas 500-kDa \u03b3-PGA did not induce a detectable amount of IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that TLR4 stimulation by \u03b3-PGA might not simply be attributable to the amino acid repeat sequences of \u03b3-PGA. Instead, more complex structures formed by HMW \u03b3-PGAs might be critical to IFN-\u03b2 production. The level of induction by this HMW \u03b3-PGA was similar to that achieved by 200 ng/ml LPS, a well-characterized TLR4 ligand, but was lower than that achieved by transfection with poly(I:C). We used this dsRNA analog as a positive control because it is known as a potent viral double strand RNA mimic triggering type I IFN production through the cytosolic nucleic acid-recognition receptors including melanoma differentiation factor 5 (MDA5) and RIG-I [38].",

Taking advantage of the fact that among IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03b3, IFN-\u03b2 is the most potent protector against SARS-CoV [40], we assessed the antiviral activity of \u03b3-PGA against SARS-CoV using the pSARS-REP-Feo replicon plasmid (Fig. 4\nC, top panel). This replicon, which lacks the viral structural genes (except for the N capsid-protein gene), produces the viral RNA transcript from a cytomegalovirus promoter and a subgenomic RNA harboring Feo (a firefly luciferase gene fused to a neomycin phosphotransferase gene) from TRS9 to display luciferase activity. This replicon was previously shown to replicate in HEK293 cells [21]. As shown in Fig. 4B, 2000-kDa \u03b3-PGA induced IFN-\u03b2 expression in a dose-dependent manner over the 1\u2013500 \u03bcm range in which \u03b3-PGA showed no significant cytotoxicity on HEK293hTLR4 cells, as assessed by MTS assay (Fig. 4A). We evaluated the antiviral activity of \u03b3-PGA in the HEK293hTLR4 cells transiently transfected with pSARS-REP-Feo and plasmids expressing MD2 and CD14. As shown in Fig. 4C, stimulation of the transfected cells with 100 \u03bcm of 2000-kDa \u03b3-PGA resulted in 65% reduction in luciferase activity, while IFN-\u03b2 1a, a potent IFN for suppressing SARS-CoV replication [40], reduced the reporter activity by 52%. The 5000-kDa \u03b3-PGA, which induced IFN-\u03b2 less efficiently than the 2000-kDa \u03b3-PGA (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), showed reduced antiviral activity, supporting the conclusion that IFN-\u03b2 induction by \u03b3-PGA is molecular weight dependent.",

To test the antiviral activity of \u03b3-PGA against HCV, we first investigated whether the hepatocarcinoma cell line Huh7, which is the only available cell line efficiently supporting HCV replication and propagation [42], requires TLR4, and MD2 and/or CD14 for induction of IFN-\u03b2 expression by \u03b3-PGA. As shown in Fig. 5\nA, \u03b3-PGA stimulation increased the IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels only when MD2 and CD14 were co-expressed, as demonstrated in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1). In consistent with previous studies demonstrating the expression of TLR4 in hepatocytes [43], [44], TLR4 overexpression did not further stimulate the IFN-\u03b2 expression. This increased IFN-\u03b2 gene expression level was associated with IRF-3 dimerization (Fig. 5B), further confirming the capacity of \u03b3-PGA to activate the IFN-\u03b2 signaling pathway. Those MD2 and CD14-epressed Huh7 cells were treated with 2000-kDa \u03b3-PGA and subsequently transfected with HCV genome encoding GFP reporter. Analysis of HCV replication levels, as assessed by GFP signal, showed that the treatment with 2000-kDa \u03b3-PGA resulted in significant inhibition of HCV replication, whereas little inhibition was seen with 5000-kDa \u03b3-PGA. More importantly, in HCV-infected cells, significant reduction in intracellular HCV genome titer (82% inhibition, p < 0.01) was observed in cells treated with 2000-kDa \u03b3-PGA, while the 5000-kDa \u03b3-PGA displayed marginal anti-HCV activity (Fig. 5E). The antiviral activity of 100 \u03bcm 2000-kDa \u03b3-PGA was comparable to that achieved with 1 \u03bcg/ml LPS or 500 U/ml IFN-\u03b1, verifying the antiviral activity of \u03b3-PGA in virus-infected cells.",

The results presented here demonstrate that \u03b3-PGA is an agonist that activates the type I IFN signaling pathway via the TLR4-MD2 complex. The type I IFN responses were only stimulated by \u03b3-PGAs with molecular weights of 2000- and 5000-kDa, with the former one being more effective in stimulation of IFN-\u03b2 production in both hPBMCs and murine macrophage. The IFN responses required CD14 as a PRR and led to inhibition of SARS-CoV replication, as assessed with a SARS-CoV replicon. In addition, substantial reduction in HCV genome titer was seen in HCV-infected Huh7 cells after treatment with 2000-kDa \u03b3-PGA. In the present work, we used transformed cells such as HEK293 and Huh7 to investigate whether TLR4 and its cofactors are required for IFN-\u03b2 gene induction by \u03b3-PGA, via transient expression of those proteins, because observations would be blurred if dendritic cells or macrophages expressing multiple TLRs were used. Highlighting a functional role of \u03b3-PGA as a TLR4 ligand, IFN-\u03b2 secretion was also observed in hPBMCs and murine macrophage. It is worthy of note that TLR4 expression increases under hepatic inflammation conditions [44] and that HCV infection induces TLR4 expression, leading to enhanced production of IFN-\u03b2 in human B cells, particularly after LPS stimulation [43]. Furthermore, CD14 expression in hepatocytes is enhanced in inflammatory states [45] and during endotoxemia [46]. Thus, it is likely that IFN-\u03b2 expression would be highly up-regulated by \u03b3-PGA in virus-infected liver. The chief targets of SARS-CoV infection in the human lung are alveolar epithelium and macrophages, and the latter is predominant infiltrating immune cells in response to the virus infection [47]. Therefore, via paracrine interactions between Kupffer cells and hepatocytes in the liver or pulmonary alveolar epithelium and macrophages in the lungs, \u03b3-PGA would potentially lead to synergistic antiviral activity in vivo. Recently, Moon et al. [18] demonstrated in vivo antiviral activity of nasally-delivered \u03b3-PGA against influenza A virus, which was proposed to be attributable to the type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3) produced mainly by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Our results, together with those of previous studies, suggest that \u03b3-PGA can activate host innate immune responses to display antiviral activity by induction of both type I (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and type II (\u03b3) IFNs.",

            "text": "We demonstrated that both MD2 and CD14 are required for TLR4-dependent responses to \u03b3-PGA. The crystal structure of TLR4-MD2 in complex with E. coli LPS shows that the hydrophobic lipid chains of LPS, a large amphipathic molecule with a molecular weight up to several ten thousand [48], are buried in the hydrophobic pocket of MD2 [1]. In addition, MD2 has been shown to play a role in the dimerization of TLR4; two MD2-LPS complexes are involved in bridging two TLR4 molecules because the two TLR4 molecules in the TLR4-MD2 heterodimer have limited direct interaction, as revealed by the crystal structure of TLR4 in complex with its ligand and MD2 [1]. We found that HEK293/hTLR4 cells transiently expressing MD2 failed to respond to \u03b3-PGA in the absence of CD14. Thus, it is unlikely that MD2 directly interacts with \u03b3-PGA, particularly when considering the hydrophilic nature of \u03b3-PGA. MD2 coexpressed with CD14, however, allowed the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and consequently resulted in IRF-3 activation, suggesting a functional role of MD2 in \u03b3-PGA-mediated TLR4-pathway activation. One possible explanation for the requirement of MD2 would be its role in TLR4 expression on the cell surface [49], [50].",

The crystal structure of CD14 shows that the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket is the principle LPS-binding site [51]. Previous biochemical investigation and structural analysis of CD14, however, strongly suggest that the long, hydrophilic, negatively charged carbohydrate chain of LPS has some affinity for CD14 [51], [52]. Consistent with those studies, CD14 does indeed interact with other negatively charged TLR ligands such as CpG DNA [12], [35] and poly(I:C) [34]. Thus, the interaction of \u03b3-PGA with CD14 is reminiscent of other hydrophilic molecules interacting with CD14 by as-yet-unknown mechanisms. Our data and the previous results discussed above suggest the role of CD14 as a PRR of multiple damage-associated molecular patterns, including PAMPs and the alarmins released in response to stress and tissue damage [12]. Nevertheless, it remains to be elucidated how CD14 can recognize different molecular compositions, particularly those of negatively charged molecules.",

Furthermore, IFN-\u03b2 induction by 5000-kDa \u03b3-PGA was attenuated compared with induction by 2000-kDa \u03b3-PGA. It is not clear why \u03b3-PGA activates TLR4-MD2 signaling transduction in such a molecular weight-dependent manner. \u03b3-PGA may form diverse conformations (\u03b1-helix, \u03b2-sheet, random coil, enveloped aggregation) at different pHs; it was proposed that at pH 6.0 a lower molecular weight (30 kDa) \u03b3-PGA forms a linear random coil with polyanionic characteristics [14]. Although we still do not know what conformations or structures can be formed by HMW \u03b3-PGAs, hydrophobically modified \u03b3-PGA (molecular weight: 300 kDa), prepared by the covalent attachment of l-phenylalanine ethyl ester, was shown to form nanoparticles due to its amphiphilic properties [53]. A \u03b3-PGA nanoparticle with a mean diameter of 210 nm was recently shown to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production via the TLR4 and MyD88 signaling pathways in mouse macrophages [54]. Those results, along with ours, are in some respects similar to the data presented in other recent studies demonstrating that LPS aggregates, but not monomers, are biologically active in the activation of TLR4-mediated inflammatory-cytokine production in human mononuclear cells [55], [56]. It remains to be determined how the \u03b3-PGAs, hydrophilic amino-acid-glutamate polymers with different molecular weights and/or structures, act as ligands of CD14 in the activation of the TLR4 and TRIF-dependent signaling pathway. This is a certainly challenging question that remains to be answered.",

[28] showed that CD14 is required for LPS-induced TLR4 endocytosis in dendritic cells, which leads to the induction of TRIF signaling to promote IFN expression in a TLR4-containing endosomal vesicle. It is tempting to speculate that the \u03b3-PGA-TLR4 complexes are subjected to CD14-mediated endocytosis, and that \u03b3-PGAs with a molecular weight greater than 2000 kDa interferes with this endocytosis. We favor the hypothesis that, as shown with LPS [28], the \u03b3-PGA-CD14/TLR4-MD2 complex is transported into endosomal vesicles to stimulate TRIF-mediated IFN expression. This hypothesis is consistent with previous findings that CD14 is marginally important for MyD88-dependent TNF-\u03b1 induction by LPS, but essential for TRIF-mediated IFN expression in macrophages [57]. Although further studies are needed to clarify the precise entry mechanisms of the HMW \u03b3-PGAs, CD14-dependent endocytosis of TLR4-\u03b3-PGA complexes into endosomes and subsequent induction of TRIF-dependent signaling may contribute to the type I IFN responses providing antiviral protection.",
