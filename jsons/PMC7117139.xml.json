Apoptosis may be initiated by a wide variety of cellular insults, including death receptor stimulation and cytotoxic compounds. Induction or inhibition of apoptosis is an important feature of many types of viral infection, both in vitro and in vivo (McLean et al., 2008, Hay and Kannourakis, 2002, Barber, 2001, Derfuss and Meinl, 2002, Benedict et al., 2002, Garnett et al., 2006).

CCoV, first described in diarrhoeic dogs (Binn et al., 1974), is responsible for diarrhoea, vomiting, dehydration, loss of appetite and occasional death in puppies. Two serotypes of CCoVs were described (Pratelli et al., 2003), CCoV-I and -II, sharing about 90% sequence identity in most of their genome. In the present study, we evaluated the processes implicated in cell death induced by CCoV, in particular of CCoV type II, which is the only CCoV that grows in cell cultures (Pratelli et al., 2004).",

            "text": "An important regulatory event in the apoptotic process is represented by the caspases activation which regulates two major relatively distinct pathways, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathway is mediated by activation of caspase-8 that is initiated mainly by binding of death receptors to their ligands. The intrinsic pathway involves the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria; subsequently, cytochrome c binds to the adaptor molecule apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) causing autocleavage of caspase-9 (Adrain et al., 1999). This pathway known also as mitochondrial pathway involves pro and anti-apoptotic members of the proteins bcl-2 family which can be a key to trigger mitochondrial apoptosis (Hildeman et al., 2002). Both pathways, extrinsic and intrinsic, converge at the activation of executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6 and -7), which are responsible for the characteristic morphological changes of apoptosis (Budihardjo et al., 1999, Elmore, 2007). Generally, both death receptor and mitochondrial apoptosis signalling pathways were shown to be implicated in apoptosis induced by viruses. Induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis has been observed during infection by other coronaviruses, including transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (Eleouet et al., 1998), avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (Liu et al., 2001), human coronavirus strain 229E (Collins, 2002), and equine coronavirus (Suzuki et al., 2008).",

The data demonstrated that both death receptor and mitochondrial pathways can play an essential role in CCoV-induced apoptosis.

Then, the active form of bid translocates to the mitochondria, and triggers bax activation in correlation with the translocation of bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria. These events result in the cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol (Korsmeyer et al., 2000, Roucou et al., 2002). Because CCoV-II infection, as shown above, induced caspase-8 activation in infected cells, we generated subcellular fractions to examine bid and cytochrome c cell localization. As shown in Fig. 7a and b, the full-length bid expression level evaluated by Western blot analysis in cytosolic fraction, decreased in time-dependent in virus-infected cells respect to mock-infected cells. The mitochondrial localization of 15 kDa fragment truncated bid (tbid) clearly appeared at 12 h p.i. Since this fragment contains the BH3 domain which is the functional part of bid for cytochrome c release, we examined whether the bid translocation was accompanied by a mitochondrial release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. The relationships with bid-induced cytochrome c release are evident in Fig. 7c and d which shows the presence of cytochrome c in the cytosolic fraction from 12 h p.i. until the end of infection.",

First, we examined by MTT assay and morphological evaluations the CCoV-II infection, demonstrating a dose- and time-dependent trend of the apoptotic process virus-induced. Then, in an attempt to understand the mechanism of induction of apoptosis in CCoV-II-infected cells we have investigated the caspase pathways. The results reported herein by FLICA method (Bedner et al., 2000) provide an unequivocal evidence that CCoV-II induces apoptotic cell death in vitro, involving caspase-dependent pathway of caspase-8 (death receptor-mediated) and caspase-9 (mitochondrial-mediated). This suggests that both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in the CCoV-II-induced apoptosis were involved. Our results match those Eleouet et al. (2000) who demonstrated that the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), also included in group 1 coronaviruses as CCoV-II, triggers caspase activation events, involving both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, during infection. Further apoptosis-associated caspase activation has been documented also in other coronavirus groups such as SARS-CoV (group 2) (Mizutani et al., 2004), MHV (group 2) (Chen and Makino, 2002), and IBV (group 3) (Liu et al., 2001).",

Therefore, the bcl-2 family of proteins have been considered as pivotal players in apoptosis. Our study has shown that CCoV-II infection down-regulated bcl-2 but up-regulated bax expression. Furthermore, densitometric analysis of bim, which is one of the candidates for initial mitochondrial activation, indicated a marked increase of protein expression level up to 36 h p.i. Bim activates bax through interactions with mcl-1 and bcl-2 (Willis et al., 2007). Here we have reported that bim significantly shifted the relative contributions of bax to cell death. Then, in response to apoptotic stimuli, bax has to translocate to mitochondria before it can oligomerize and form pores (Desagher and Martinou, 2000), and the relative decline in bcl-2 expression permits bax to gain dominance, the downstream effects of which most likely involve both direct and indirect activation of the cell death proteases that represent the final steps in the apoptotic pathway.",
