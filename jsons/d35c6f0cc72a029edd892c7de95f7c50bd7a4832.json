During that period, we followed the confirmed COVID-19 cases released by the government websites (e.g. alberta.ca, bccdc.ca, ontario.ca, and quebec.ca) every day and obtained travel history of these cases from national and local news websites (e.g. cbc.ca, globalnews.ca, and toronto.ctvnews.ca).

The areas of the convex polygons in the Voronoi treemap are proportional to the weights of their corresponding nodes in the \"tree\" (Nocaj and Brandes, 2012) . In our analyses, terminal nodes represented countries/regions and internal nodes represented continents (or sub-continents), which combining with the root node (i.e. the globe) constituted a hierarchical structure. The weight of a terminal node was equal to the number of the confirmed patients who returned from the country/region corresponding to the node. If a case was linked to a person who \"recently\" travelled to two countries/regions, 0.5 was added to the weight of one of the two countries/regions. A convex polygon labeled by \"MEC\" was particularly assigned to the patients who recently travelled to more than two European countries J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (see Figure 1A ). The community cases, i.e. without recent travel records, were counted for the weight of the Canadian node. Another Voronoi treemap ( Figure 1B) was produced to show the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases over the globe by March 11, 2020. In Figure 1B , we assigned a terminal node only to the country/region that had at least 100 confirmed cases by March 11, 2020 or more than 50 confirmed cases by March 11, 2020 and had appeared in Figure 1A . were reported by Iran (Worldometer, 2020) . Given the close connection between Canada and China and the much larger number of confirmed cases reported by China than by any other country, it might be expected that Canada's earliest coronavirus cases would have been mainly related to travel from China. However, as shown in our Figures, in actuality only 9 (7.6%) of the 118 cases were related to travels from China while an impressive number (35, 30.0% of 118) of cases were linked to travel from Iran. Other travel destinations that were highly implicated included the United States (18.2%, by air or surface travel), Europe (13.1%), and Egypt (10.1%) (see Table 1 ).",

Broader initial responses with respect to travel bans (i.e. related to more countries where confirmed COVID-19 cases had emerged) on the part of governments could have been considered.
