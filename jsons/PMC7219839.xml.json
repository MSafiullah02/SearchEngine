Recently, Lai and Chang4 suggested using a cardboard box during intubation to reduce the risk of transmission to caregivers. In our opinion, the idea is very good;however, such a device is probably of limited feasibility in clinical routine, as it limits the view of patients and caregivers. In addition, the box is likely to be an obstacle when the intubation is unexpectedly difficult with all devices stuck in the side ports of the shield. Therefore, we suggest a useful alternative to further reduce the risk of staff infection during airway management.",

We use this barrier in addition to protective masks, gloves, goggles, and clothing during the intubation process. After a detailed explanation of the measures to be taken, the patients agree to the spread of the TS over the entire body including the head. The TS should be handled with care and in slow motion to avoid air turbulences and holes. The patient, who is monitored with pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram (ECG) and invasive or noninvasive arterial blood pressure measurements, can breathe freely through an oxygen mask, communicate, and observe the surroundings underneath the TS before intubation. Furthermore, the cover fits everyone irrespective of the patient\u2019s body mass index (BMI).",

Compared to an aerosol box specially developed for intubation,3 a TS also offers a good view of the patient\u2019s head and oral cavity, additionally to this, it is very easy to handle if the intubation is unexpectedly difficult. The TS provides extra protection against possible air turbulences due to accidental leakage or disconnection of the breathing tubes, unplanned manual ventilation via facemask, or other unforeseen events. After the intubation, this effect can also be helpful during transport within the hospital to the intensive care unit (Figure, panelB).",
