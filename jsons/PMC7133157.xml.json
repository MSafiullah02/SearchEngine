This paper examines China's FOI Regulations and argues that China has adopted a push model of FOI legislation that emphasizes proactive disclosure of government information. This differs from a pull model that stresses citizen-initiated access or reactive disclosure. The push model of FOI legislation, which has reduced the importance of access requests in China, grew out of its local causes. However, the degree of push or proactive disclosure under China's current FOI Regulations is undermined by several factors, including a limited access mechanism, broad and vague exemptions, and the omission of the maximum disclosure principle.",

This indicates that most FOI legislation between the 1960s and the 1980s had a strong \u201cantagonistic\u201d (Schartum, 2004) and individualized nature (Terrill, 2000). A pull model was the result of a compromise between key information demand side players, including the media and the parliament, and the executive (Schartum, 2004). Globalization, promoted by international institutions such as the World Bank, has led to many recent FOI adopters favoring a pull model.",

            "text": "More importantly, the significance of citizen-initiated access has been reduced in the information age (Schartum, 2004, Gellman, 2004), requiring a push model of FOI legislation to be introduced to adapt to the changed information environment. Information flow, with the assistance of information technology, has become easier and more frequent. FOI academics, such as Snell (2008, November 4), call for a shift from \u201cversion 1.0\u201d FOI focusing on reactive disclosure to \u201cversion 2.0\u201d emphasizing proactive disclosure. Government agencies have also become more receptive to information sharing in order to adapt to an improved information environment. The US revised its FOI legislation in 1996 to accommodate to the information age, changing its strong pull version to include more proactive disclosure requirements (Tankersley, 1998, Gellman, 2004). The Obama administration has taken significant measures, such as releasing FOI Act Memorandum and Transparent and Open Government Memorandum, in order to improve the role of proactive disclosure in implementing FOI legislation. The UK FOI law provides for a publication scheme, which requires government agencies to provide information to the public routinely and proactively. In Mexico, government agencies are required to publish an extensive amount of information on their Web sites. More importantly, Australia is taking the lead in promoting a push model to become policy, especially at the sub-national level. Queensland, Tasmania, and New South Wales are presently developing this model (The FOI Independent Review Panel, 2008, Tasmanian Department of Justice., 2009, The Department of Premier & Cabinet in New South Wales, 2009).",

The first is the previous two decades of Openness in Government Affairs (OGA), which refers to non legally binding proactive disclosure of government information and has been closely linked to a long-term democratization process. Democratic election, decision making, management, and supervision have been recognized as four major means of developing China's socialist democracy since 1997. The four democratic means, the last three in particular, laid the foundation for extension of OGA to all levels of government. The political report of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1997 first recognized the need for the exercise of democratic decision making, management, and supervision to be assisted by openness (Jiang, 1997).",

The gradual transformation of the Chinese information environment has provided a receptive space for the push aspect, but the pull aspect was muted or unacceptable until the adoption of FOI Regulations.

In an improved information environment where alternative information sources, such as citizen journalists, can provide reliable crisis information to the general public, government officials will pay huge financial and public-trust costs for concealing information. This has prompted the Chinese government to become more transparent and proactive in dealing with crises. Furthermore, rising threats to society by rumors in the improved information environment have forced the Chinese government to abandon its old information management approach (Li, 2008). It now recognizes that rumors can be transformed and denied with reliable information release (Yaoyan Zhi Yu Gongkai), rather than the converse.",

The emphasis on proactive disclosure may have reduced the workload of government agencies arising from the process of access requests due to China's huge population, vast territory, and high volume of government information (Yang, 2007). These unique features have required that less emphasis be placed on access requests in order to allow government agencies to exercise their core functions. This explains why several Chinese developing areas, such as Hunan, are keen on adopting the push approach. The Hunan government (2008) considers that this approach helps it focus on other more urgent tasks in its locality.",

Three FOI articles establish minimum standards in the field of making government information publicly available by listing key information that is to be proactively disclosed. Article 10 requires government agencies at or above the county level to emphasize proactive disclosure of government information, such as information on government procurement, budgets and expenses, public health, and food and drug safety. Article 11 obliges government agencies at the county level to stress disclosing additional information, such as information on land requisition and assistance to low income families. Article 12 emphasizes information to be disseminated by government agencies at the township level, such as information on land use plans and implementation of family planning policies.",

The former director of the State Council Information Office argues that spokespersons \u2013 the guides of the Chinese and foreign media outlets to report on China \u2013 play a vital role in promoting government information release. As a result, press conferences are set out in Article 15 of China's FOI legislation as an important means by which government information can be actively disclosed. Zhou (2007b) argues that this arrangement is unreasonable since other countries' FOI laws rarely list press conferences as a formal way to disclose government information.

This service covers all sorts of proactively disclosed information.

It contains the verb harm without any adverb, such as significantly or substantially, to describe the degree of injury. No harm test applies to an exemption concerning state secrets, trade secrets, or privacy under the Regulations, which means these exemptions are \u201cclass-based\u201d (McDonagh, 1998).

A special public interest test is found in FOI legislation of Australia, Ireland, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

This allows information to be released when \u201cpublic benefit in knowing the information outweighs any harm that may be caused from disclosure\u201d (Banisar, 2005).

Gradualism refers to the belief that changes occur, or ought to occur, slowly in the form of gradual steps. The gradual approach is a key element of Dengism that is a series of political and economic ideologies first developed by Chinese political leader Xiaoping Deng. This theory was written into the Party Constitution of the Communist Party of China and the preface of the Constitution in 1999. It appears that \u201csecrecy still enjoys priority during the process of information disclosure\u201d (Chen, 2008). Thus, a special principle is found under Article 8 of the FOI Regulations, which prohibits government agencies from disclosing government information that may prejudice state security, public security, economic security, or social stability. Article 8 is also considered by law reformers as a basic principle for guiding government agencies to disclose information (Yang, 2007). This basic principle, which can encourage government officials to err on the side of secrecy, explains the lack of the maximum disclosure principle.",

This push model has reduced the importance of access requests. The push model of FOI legislation reflects the push to pull development of FOI in China. Furthermore, the proactive disclosure requirements under the FOI Regulations provide a clear obligation and minimum standard for government agencies to follow, and thus improve the likelihood of government compliance. However, the degree of proactive disclosure under China's FOI legislation has been constrained by a limited access mechanism, broad and poorly defined exemptions, and the omission of the maximum disclosure principle. It is necessary to relax these constraints in China's future FOI law in order to increase the push degree.",
