Encouragingly, recent epidemiological data show that the 3 epidemic curve seems to have entered into a plateauing/descending phase in most of the affected 4 countries. Accordingly, national and local administrators start reasoning about the post-5 emergency phase (or the so-called \"phase 2\"), that is the set of measures that should allow the 6 country to gradually return to a condition of \"normality\" after the lockdown is eased. 2 It is, 7 however, very likely that nothing will be as before this experience, and it is expected that the 8 coronavirus crisis will cause major social and economic issues for a long time. 9",

During these last weeks, many hospital and nursing home units have been converted 13 into COVID-19 units to provide care and support to the huge number of patients infected by the 14 SARS-CoV-2. Traditional clinical units have been transformed to host intensive care beds. 3 Several 15 healthcare professionals have temporarily been relocated, sometimes outside their qualifications 16 and specialties, to tackle the contingent needs caused by the epidemic. Elective clinical activities 17 have largely been suspended and/or postponed sine die. All these measures, urgently needed 18 during the period, will have to be gradually reconsidered as the emergency comes to the end. 19",

            "text": "during the COVID-19 outbreak, the clinical conditions of patients with dementia might 35 change. Beyond a possible decline of cognitive and functional capacities, the worsening of 36 preexisting neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., agitation, aggression, depression, sleep disorders) 37 and/or the onset of new behavioral disruptions may have occurred. These disturbances are highly 38 fluctuating and are strongly influenced by environmental and social determinants. The adopted 39 isolation and social distancing measures might contribute to generate feelings of loneliness and 40 abandonment, potentially triggering behavioral modifications in people with dementia. 5 Moreover, 41 these preventive strategies against the SARS-CoV-2 might have hindered the implementation of 42 those non-pharmacological strategies that are daily used by family members and caregivers to 43 tentatively manage the neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., distraction, diversification of the living 44 environment, involvement in stimulating activities, going out for a walk). 6 This might result in 45 greater use of psychoactive pharmacological treatments and consequent side effects. The 46 dynamics of the caregiving process have been also changing in these last weeks. Several adult 47 daycare centers are closed to avoid the gathering of people. Patient's care has increasingly been 48 4 as soon as the post-emergency phase begins. This implies the serious risk of overloading the 73 dedicated services and reducing the quality of provided care. In this scenario, it appears 74 imperative to develop and implement triage/assignment systems that may allow referrals to be 75 informed more in detail about the \"actual\" patient's needs and care priorities. This implies a more 76 correct allocation of resources, serving people based on their health status rather than on pure 77 administrative models (e.g., \"first come, first served\") recovering missed appointments. These 78 procedures may be implemented via the adoption of brief triage questionnaires focused on the 79 biopsychosocial status of the person suffering from dementia to be administered by phone or the 80 internet. For instance, the timing of the clinical assessment could be assessed considering some of 81 the following parameters whose impact on the quality of life and clinical trajectories in the use of psychoactive medications; 85 -modification of the general clinical status requiring the adjustment of existing therapies 86 and/or hospitalization and/or access to emergency departments; 87 -fall events during the past month; 88 -reduction of functional capacity (e.g., slower gait speed)not surprising that in the rethinking of healthcare systems in response to COVID-19, a 94 greater use of telehealth has also been repeatedly advocated. 9 The delivery of remote care could 95 have important advantages for people with dementia and their families. 10 It can avoid outpatient 96 5 visits in crowded hospitals, reduce the need for long travels, and minimize the risk of serious 97 complications such as fall events. All these aspects assume special relevance nowadays in light of 98 the still high risk of contagion. Interestingly, data exist showing the non-inferiority of clinical 99 evaluations conducted via video-conferencing compared to face-to-face assessments in memory 100 clinics. 11 Moreover, telemedicine may support a more ecological assessment of the individual in 101 his/her living environment, thus reducing the impact of those emotional and contextual factors 102 (e.g., stigma, confidentiality, fatigue) that may bias the assessment of cognitive deficits and 103 neuropsychiatric symptoms. Of course, this is not as straightforward and easy as it might seem. It 104 requires that physicians assume a new mindset, familiarize with the new way of working and 105 prioritize the patient's interests over the fear of mistakes due to the novel technological 106 approach. 12 107 Other forms of remote care for older persons with dementia could be represented by 108 electronic diaries, applications, or other tools that can improve the monitoring of the highly 109 fluctuating manifestations of dementia. 13 The period of necessary reorganization we are going to 110 face in the future should represent an opportunity for implementing (also taking advantage of 111 technologies) all those measures able to facilitate exchanges between caregivers and healthcare 112 professionals. 113 In conclusion, it is now time to consider how the reopening of healthcare services should 114 be arranged after the coronavirus crisis abates. Key considerations include organizing pathways 115 to allocate persons with dementia (and others with frailty) according to their health status; 116 providing enhanced resources to mitigate caregiver burden; triaging patients to identify needs 117 and priorities as services open; and maximizing the electronic and telehealth resources that 118",
