They are sexually transmitted causing approximately 5 million new infections per year in the USA (Cates, 1999). Mucosal, low-risk HPV types cause benign anogenital warts, whereas a limited number of high-risk HPV types cause the majority of anogenital cancers as well as a subset of oropharyngeal malignancies; HPV16 and HPV18 are responsible for the largest proportion of carcinomas (de Sanjose et al., 2010; Prigge et al., 2017; Walboomers et al., 1999). Prophylactic vaccines are available, yet these protect against only a sub-set of HPV types with little impact upon pre-existing infections (Schiller and M\u00fcller, 2015). Moreover, HPV vaccination programmes are poorly available in most developing countries where cervical cancer is more frequent (Bruni et al., 2016). Effective antiviral agents represent an alternative approach to treating HPV infections, yet no such drugs are currently available.",

E5 mRNA is highly abundant in HPV lesions (Stoler et al., 1992), and the protein is likely expressed in the early stages of malignancy, when episomal viral genomes are present (Chang et al., 2001).

E5 modulation of EGFR is implicated in pathogenesis, and expression of a dominant negative EGFR attenuates epithelial hyperplasia observed in E5-transgenic mice (Genther Williams et al., 2005). The generation of high-risk HPV genomes lacking E5 expression has identified a key role during the productive stages of infection (Fehrmann et al., 2003; Genther et al., 2003; Wasson et al., 2017). Recently, EGFR activation has been shown to be critical for E5 function during the productive stages of the HPV lifecycle (Wasson et al., 2017). In the absence of EGFR signalling, HPV18 containing keratinocytes fail to maintain cyclin B1 expression in the suprabasal layers of the epithelium and instead initiate default differentiation programmes. Precisely how EGFR signalling is augmented by E5 is unknown, but may involve E5-mediated alkalinisation of EGFR-containing endosomes, preventing degradation, and resulting in recycling of activated receptor to the plasma membrane (Straight et al., 1995). How E5 perturbs endosome acidification remains unknown.",

However, other cellular functions can also be altered by these proteins, including vesicle trafficking and apoptosis. Inhibition of viroporin function represents an ideal target for antiviral drug development (Scott and Griffin, 2015), with clinical precedent set by prototypic adamantane drugs targeting the influenza A virus (IAV) M2 proton channel (Pinto et al., 1992).",

These compounds have since been shown to exert antiviral effects against a number of viruses including HCV, BVDV, Dengue and SARS-CoV (Pavlovi\u0107 et al., 2003; Stgelais et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2002; Zitzmann et al., 1999). As rimantadine effectively blocks HPV16 E5 activity (Wetherill et al., 2012), we examined whether other prototypic viroporin inhibitors might block 16E5 viroporin activity in an in vitro liposome dye release assay (Fig. 1\nA) (Wetherill et al., 2012), namely HMA, the long alkyl-chain imino sugar NN-DNJ and the short alkyl-chain imino sugar NB-DGJ (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, HMA (400 \u03bcM) treatment enhanced both the initial rate of CF release from liposomes and likewise increased endpoint fluorescence compared to the DMSO control (Fig. 1C and D). In these assays Triton X-100 treatment yielded maximal fluorescence. This increase was likely due to either HMA induced fusion events, non-specific disruption of liposomes, or HMA holding the E5 channel complex in a more open conformation. In contrast addition of both NN-DNJ and NB-DGJ led to a significant reduction in 16E5-mediated CF release from liposomes, as measured by initial rate or endpoint fluorescence (Fig. 1E and F).",

Unlike previous studies where rimantadine occupied a lipophilic pocket in the lining of the channel lumen (Wetherill et al., 2012), NN-DNJ instead intercalated between E5 monomers at the protomer interface with a GlideScore of \u22125.1 kcal/mol (Fig. 3\nA). This was predicted to disrupt the pi stack generated by TM1 Phe15 and TM3\u2019 Phe60 (Fig. 3B), potentially disrupting oligomerisation of E5 protomers. NB-DGJ adopted a similar binding pose although was located closer to the pore, and also likely impairs the monomer interaction by disrupting the Thr38 \u2013 Thr40 hydrogen bond (Supplementary Fig. 1A). NB-DGJ had a similar estimated Glide docking score to NN-DNJ of \u22125.4 kcal/mol.",

Again, inhibitors were able to reverse the retention of ERK phosphorylation and cyclin B1 expression in the presence of differentiation stimuli, reducing them to similar levels observed in cells harbouring the E5KO genome (compare lanes 2 and 3 plus 3 and 5). As a consequence of the loss of mitogenic signalling we noted that wild type cells treated with viroporin inhibitors exhibited an increase in differentiation marker expression. Thus, taken together our data demonstrate that E5 viroporin activity is critical for maintenance of mitogenic signalling and the delay in differentiation marker expression observed during the productive stages of the HPV18 life cycle.",

Unlike rimantadine, NN-DNJ is predicted to intercalate between protomers within validated molecular models of the HPV16 E5 channel complex, suggesting that interrupting oligomerisation represents a potential inhibitory mechanism for these compounds. Specifically, NN-DNJ binding to the 16E5 channel is predicted to disrupt the pi stack generated by TM1 Phe15 and TM3\u2019 Phe60, reducing the stability of protomer-protomer binding. Interestingly, alignment of E5 amino acid sequence identifies equivalent Phe residues in the mucosal HPV types, suggesting that if these residues do mediate oligomerisation then NN-DNJ may have the potential for cross-activity against several HPV types. Similarly, NN-DNJ was shown to prevent HCV p7 oligomerisation, with a similar inter-protomer binding site predicted by docking studies (Foster et al., 2011). This binding site was validated by the co-location of a resistance polymorphism, F25A, within the site, identified through the innate NN-DNJ resistance of genotype 3a p7. As we have employed a similar modelling/docking strategy herein, this highlights a potential mechanistic similarity between 16E5 and p7 oligomerisation, which should be further investigated. Lastly, it is notable that shorter chain imino sugars (e.g. NB-DGJ) could inhibit 16E5 viroporin activity in vitro. These compounds are ineffective against other viroporins, including p7 (Steinmann et al., 2007). Analysis of the NB-DGJ binding mode suggested that it also interacts with E5 at the protomer interface which would likely interfere with channel oligomerisation. Satisfied that both rimantadine and the imino sugars represented inhibitors of E5 channel function, we employed them as tools with which to dissect the potential link between E5 viroporin activity and key aspects of E5 function within cells.",

However, a significant number (\u223c15%) of cervical cancers contain unintegrated HPV genomes and a much lower frequency of viral DNA integration occurs in HPV positive HNSCC (Morgan et al., 2017; Olthof et al., 2014). Moreover, E5 protein can be detected by mass spectrometry in cervical cancer cell lines containing an integrated HPV genome (Sahab et al., 2012). Therefore, E5 expression likely persists within a subset of advanced HPV positive tumours.

            "text": "A major aspect of E5 oncogenic function is the activation of EGFR signalling to drive cyclin B1 expression via ERK in the suprabasal layers of the epithelium (Wasson et al., 2017). Interestingly, this likely involves alkalinisation of EGFR-containing endosomes; this was originally ascribed to interactions between E5 and cellular vATPase (Conrad et al., 1993), yet this is now thought not to be the case (Suprynowicz et al., 2010). Our previous observation that acidic pH activates E5 channel activity in vitro is reminiscent of other viroporins such as p7 and M2, both of which serve to promote vesicle alkalinisation. Consistent with a similar role for high risk E5 in cells, treatment of E5 expressing keratinocytes, or cells harbouring full-length HPV genomes, with rimantadine or imino sugars prevented increased cyclin B expression and concomitant ERK phosphorylation. Inhibitors had no obvious off-target effects, with neither cells expressing GFP alone, nor HPV-transformed cell lines with integrated genomes lacking E5, showing any modulation of the pathway upon treatment. This observation was consistent between E5 from three high-risk HPV types, suggesting that the link between E5 viroporin activity and at least one major aspect of its pro-oncogenic function are directly linked.",
