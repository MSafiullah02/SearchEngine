The NeuroVision Data Center was located in a secured hosting facility in Singapore and is composed of a cluster of computer servers and databases, storing all relevant clinical and treatment data. For the treatment of low myopia, the NVC LM1 algorithm was used. Algorithms are patient-specific and adaptive to subject response, thus providing analysis of each subject's dysfunctions, resulting in individualized treatment algorithms. Improved visual function is achieved through repetitive performance of interactive visual perception tasks (VPTs), in which subject-specific stimuli are administered on a treatment workstation. The NVC treatment may be clinic based or home based and adapted to the performance of each subject. In this study, patients were offered the option of home-based or clinic-based treatment.",

A typical VPT comprises 2 consecutive displays; 1 of the pair displays the target Gabor the subject should identify. The target is presented in the first or second of 2 images, each lasting 80 to 320 ms, at an interval of 500 ms. The subject is seated 1.5 m from the screen and uses a 2-button mouse to activate the presentation of each pair of images at his or her own pace. With subjects instructed to keep both eyes open at all times, detection of the target Gabor stimuli in the first of the 2 images requires a \u201cleft click\u201d response with the mouse, while detection of the target GS in the second of the 2 images requires a \u201cright\u201d click for the correct response. Subjects are informed of a wrong response by an auditory response. Depending on the level of UCVA, at the start of treatment, standardized myopic undercorrection in the form of training glasses of \u22121.0 D or \u22120.5 D or no glasses are prescribed for the treatment sessions. These glasses are subsequently reduced in power or removed as visual acuity improves. In some instances, to focus treatment visual training on the worst eye, a neutral density filter to fog vision over the better eye is used in the training glasses. Subjects are presented with a series of Gabor stimuli with the following parameters dynamically controlled: number of Gabors, spatial arrangement, global and local orientation, target\u2013flankers separation, exposure time, contrast, spatial frequency (Figure 1).",

Despite the prevailing belief that adult brain cells do not grow and that whatever limited plasticity exists in the adult brain does not involve structural remodeling, recent cortical imaging studies using 2-photon laser scanning microscopy techniques are challenging traditional concepts. Lee et al.28 confirmed the presence of dynamic structural remodeling and dendritic arbor growth occurring in GABA-positive nonpyramidal interneurons in the visual cortex of mice. Holtmaat et al.29 recently reported dendritic spine growth in the mouse adult neocortex as a direct response to novel sensory experience by whisker trimming, providing evidence that sensory input might modulate structural and functional synaptic changes in specific neocortical circuits.",
