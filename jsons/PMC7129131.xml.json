A study of the largest reported outbreak of MERS-CoV6 estimated the median incubation period to be 5\u00b72 days (95% CI 1\u00b79\u201314\u00b77), and reported a high rate of person-to-person transmission in 21 of 23 cases in health-care settings.6 Case-fatality rate was high (65%) in this outbreak.7 Of more than 417 household and health-care contacts, symptoms of MERS-CoV developed in only seven people.6 A subsequent large-scale phylogenetic analysis of 21 genome sequences and inclusion of the previous nine published MERS-CoV genomes showed that multiple introductions of MERS-CoV and lower R0 values were possible.7 Thus MERS-CoV has not yet reached pandemic potential. Transmission within Saudi Arabia was consistent with movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or infected people. The source of the infection has yet to be identified, although bats and camels have been implicated.",

Groups particularly at risk from infection include pregnant women, children younger than 12 years, adults older than 65 years, and those with chronic or acute diseases. The concern over the pandemic potential of MERS-CoV was estimated in two recent publications.9 In one optimistic view,9 the estimated MERS-CoV R0 was 0\u00b769 compared with the R0 for prepandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus of 0\u00b780. This optimistic estimate downplayed the possibility of a MERS-CoV pandemic, which supported the recommendations of the Third Meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee,10 that MERS-CoV does not warrant international measures to curtail Hajj-related travel. Sporadic cases MERS-CoV continue to be reported, and thus continued vigilance and further studies are needed to close the knowledge gap in MERS-CoV epidemiology and clinical presentations.5\n",

Infected patients were older adults with a median age of 61 years, with twice as many men infected than women. It is also interesting to note that most patients infected with H7N9 had a pre-existing medical condition. Subsequent analysis of 136 laboratory confirmed cases showed a mortality bias toward men older than 50 years.15 Of the total cases, 7% were reported in individuals younger than 20 years, with no fatal cases in this age group.15\n",

This pattern seems to be due to recognition bias, because younger cases are now being identified who have no underlying medical conditions. In facing future challenges of emerging respiratory viruses such as influenza there is a clear need for the development of effective influenza vaccines that target the conserved antigenic structures of influenza virus. Continued contact of humans with animals creates an added risk of development of zoonotic diseases, adaptation of the new virus rendering it infectious to humans, and possible efficient transmission of these viruses among the human population.",
