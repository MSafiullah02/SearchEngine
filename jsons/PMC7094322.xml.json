Papers reporting on mixed methods studies within healthcare research were reviewed to (i) determine the type of analysis approach used, i.e. parallel, concurrent, or sequential data analysis and, (ii) identify studies which could be used to illustrate the use of the methodological metaphor of triangulation suggested by Erzberger and Kelle (2003). Four papers were selected to illustrate the application of the triangulation metaphor on complementary, convergent and divergent outcomes and to develop theory.",

The most widely used analytic approach (n\n = 98) was parallel analysis (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2007). However, very few of the studies employing parallel analysis clearly articulate their purpose for mixing qualitative and quantitative data, the weighting (or priority) given to the qualitative and quantitative data or the expected outcomes from doing so, mirroring previous research findings (O\u2019Cathain et al., 2008). The weighting, or priority, of the qualitative and quantitative data in a mixed methods study is dependent upon various factors including; the aims of the study and whether the purpose is, for example, to contextualise quantitative data using qualitative data or to use qualitative data to inform a larger quantitative approach such as a survey. Nonetheless, the omission of this statement makes it difficult to determine which data set the conclusions have been drawn from and the role of, or emphasis on, each approach. Therefore, is of importance for authors to clearly state this in their papers (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2007). A number of studies had also used sequential data analysis (n\n = 46), where qualitative approaches were visibly used to inform the development of both clinical tools (e.g. Canales and Rakowski, 2006) and research measures and surveys (e.g. Beatty et al., 2004) or where quantitative surveys were supplemented by and issues further explored using qualitative approaches (e.g. Abadia and Oviedo, 2009, Cheng, 2004, Halcomb et al., 2008).",

Despite this, there remained a lack of clarity within these studies about the weighting given to, and priority of, each method. Consequently, the importance and relevance of the findings produced by each approach and how these have informed their conclusions and interpretation is lacking. In four of the included papers a combination of approaches to data analysis (i.e. sequential and concurrent, parallel and concurrent, or sequential and parallel) were used.

Following concerns that inadequate education might limit the confidence of some DNs to support patients and their carers\u2019 at home, and that low home death rates may in part be related to this, the Department of Health (DH) identified good examples of palliative care educational initiatives for DNs and invested in a 3-year national education and support programme in the principles and practice of palliative care. Shipman et al.\u2019s study evaluates whether the programme had measurable effects on DN knowledge and confidence in competency in the principles and practice of palliative care. The study had two parts, a summative (concerned with outcomes) quantitative component which included \u2018before and after\u2019 postal questionnaires which measured effects on DNs\u2019 (n\n = 1280) knowledge, confidence and perceived competence in the principles and practice of palliative care and a formative (concerned with process) qualitative component which included semi-structured focus groups and interviews with a sub-sample of DNs (n\n = 39).",

Qualitative results supported and complemented the quantitative findings as the district nurses described several benefits from the program including greater confidence in tackling complex problems and better communication with patient and carers\u2019 because of greater understanding of the reasons for symptoms. Thus, a complementary theoretical proposition (theoretical proposition 2, Fig. 2) can be deduced from the qualitative findings: the DN's better understanding of factors contributing to complex problems and underlying reasons for symptoms led to improved confidence in competence raised from district nurses increased understanding.",

With regards to the theoretical proposition of the study (Fig. 3), group cohesion was seen as essential to understand the processes within the group that facilitated the achievement of desired outcomes and the satisfaction of affective needs as well as promoting a sense of belonging to the group itself.",

This proposition was tested quantitatively by pre- and post-test using the RSSI showing that the majority of carers experienced either a negative or no change in scores following the respite stay (no test of significance was stated). Accordingly, the theoretical proposition was not supported by the quantitative empirical data. The qualitative empirical results, however, were supportive in showing that most of the carers considered respite care to be important as it enabled them to have a break and a rest from ongoing care-responsibilities. From this divergent empirical data it could be suggested changing or developing the original theoretical proposition. It seems that respite care gave the carers relief from their care-responsibilities but not from the distress carers experienced in relation to caring (measured by the used scale). We would therefore suggest that in order to lessen distress related to caring, other types of support is also needed which would change the theoretical proposition as suggested (theoretical proposition 2).",

The qualitative approach generated information concerning both QoL in the individuals\u2019 life situation and life course and the individuals\u2019 rehabilitation. Both the quantitative and the qualitative analysis showed the youngest CAD patients to have the poorest psychosocial QoL. The results obtained using qualitative methods explained the quantitative findings and offered new insight into the factors related to poor psychosocial QoL, which could be used to help develop theoretical propositions around these. Patients at risk of poorer QoL were those with an acute onset of illness at a young age that led to an unexpected termination of career, resulting in financial problems, and worries about family. This group also experienced lack of emotional support (especially the females with CAD) and were concerned for the illness that was not alleviated by treatment. The interviews and the method of phenomenological psychology therefore helped to gain insight into the participants\u2019 situational experience of QoL and life course, not detectable by the use of a questionnaire.",

Similarly, the need for guidance on the analysis and integration of qualitative and quantitative data is a prominant issue (Bazeley, 2009). This paper firstly intended to review the types of analytic approaches (parallel, concurrent or sequential data analysis) that have been used in mixed methods studies within healthcare research. As identified in previous research (O\u2019Cathain et al., 2008), we found that the majority of studies included in our review employed parallel data analysis in which the different analyses are not compared or consolidated until the full analysis of both data sets have been completed. A trend to conduct separate analysis on quantitative and qualitative data is apparent in mixed methods healthcare studies, despite the fact that if the data were correlated, a more complete picture of a particular phenomenon may be produced (Onwuegbuzie and Teddlie, 2003). If qualitative and quantitative data are not integrated during data collection or analysis, the findings may be integrated at the stage of interpretation and conclusion.",

Yet despite the fact that the framework was published in 2003 within Tashakkori and Teddlie's (2003) seminal work, the Handbook for Mixed Methods in Social and Behavioural Research, our search revealed that it has received little application within the published body of work around mixed methods studies since its publication. This is surprising since mixed methodologists are acutely aware of the lack of guidance with regards to the pragmatics and practicalities of conducting mixed methods research (Bryman, 2006, Leech et al., 2010). Furthermore, there have been frequent calls to move the field of mixed methods away from the \u201cshould we or shouldn\u2019t we\u201d debate towards the practical application, analysis and integration of mixed methods and its\u2019 findings and what we can learn from each other's work and advice. Consequently, we have a state of ambiguity and instability in the field of mixed methods in which mixed methodologists find themselves lacking appropriate sources or evidence to draw upon with which to facilitate the future design, conduct and interpretation of mixed methods studies.

Wu and Volker (2009) previously acknowledged that while studies undoubtedly have a theoretical basis in their literature reviews and the nature of their research questions, they often fail to clearly articulate a particular theoretical framework. This is unfortunate as theory can help researchers to clarify their ideas and also help data collection, analysis and to improve the study's rigour (Wu and Volker, 2009). When using triangulation as a methodological metaphor (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003), researchers are encouraged to articulate their theoretical propositions and to validate their conclusions in relation to the chosen theories. Theory can also guide researchers when defining outcome measures. Should the findings not support the chosen theory, as shown in our examples on complementary and divergent results, researchers can modify or expand their theory accordingly and new theory may be developed (Wu and Volker, 2009). It is therefore our belief that using triangulation as a methodological metaphor in mixed methods research can also benefit the design of mixed method studies.",

Many of the papers were even less clear when discussing their results and the basis of their conclusions. The reporting of mixed methods studies is notoriously challenging, but clarity and transparency are, at the very least, crucial in such reports (O\u2019Cathain, 2009). Using triangulation as a methodological metaphor (Erzberger and Kelle, 2003) may be one way of addressing this lack of clarity by explicitly showing the types of data that researchers have based their interpretations on. It may even help address some of the issues raised in the debate on the feasibility of integrating research methods and results stemming from different epistemological and ontological assumptions and paradigms (Morgan, 2007, Sale et al., 2002). In order to carry out methodological triangulation researchers also need to identify and observe the consistency and adequacy of the two methods, positivistic and phenomenological regarding the research questions, data collection, methods of analysis and conclusions.",

In many cases, reports of mixed methods studies are subjected to \u2018salami slicing\u2019 by researchers and hence the conduct of, and findings from, individual approaches are addressed in separate papers. Since these papers are often not indexed as a \u2018mixed method\u2019 study, they are undoubtedly more difficult to identify. Furthermore, different terminologies are used to describe and index mixed methods studies within the electronic databases (Halcomb and Andrew, 2009a), making it challenging to be certain that all relevant studies were captured in this review. However, the studies included in this review should give a sufficient overview of the use of mixed analysis in healthcare research and most importantly, they enable us to make suggestions for the future design, conduct, interpretation and reporting of mixed methods studies. It is also important to emphasise that we have based our triangulation examples on the data published but have no further knowledge of the analysis and findings undertaken by the authors. The examples should thus be taken as examples and not alternative explanations or interpretations.",
