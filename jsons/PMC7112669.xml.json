Genetic diversity among Salmonella spp. has enabled some serovars to survive against sudden environmental changes including the increases in the temperature, the decreases in pH and water activity, and also other radical changes that commonly occur in food production and processing systems (Herrera et al., 2013). Therefore, development of appropriate detection and control measures is essential to minimize the bacterial dissemination and disease progression.",

The administration of specific antibodies has been prompted by the need to find an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapies, in response to the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant or nonresponsive organisms. Antibodies may exert a kind of antimicrobial activity through binding, neutralizing, and ultimately inhibiting the growth, replication, and dissemination of pathogens (Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2004). The oral administration of egg yolks containing specific polyclonal antibodies was successfully tested in mice, chickens, calves, and piglets (G\u00fcrtler et al., 2004; Rahimi et al., 2007; Yokoyama et al., 1998).",

Chicken IgYs are transferred in large quantities from serum to the egg yolks (with a concentration of about 25 mg/mL) in order to give passive immunity to the developing offspring (Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2004). The overall structure of chicken IgYs is somewhat similar to the mammalian IgG, with two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains. IgY possesses four constant domains in heavy chain (C\u03bd1\u2013C\u03bd4) that makes them have a higher molecular weight (180 kDa) than mammalian IgG (159 kDa). The chicken IgY molecule is also more hydrophobic than the IgG, with a lower isoelectric point (Kassim et al., 2011; Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2004).",

            "text": "The use of chicken eggs as a source of specific polyclonal antibodies offers several advantages over producing antibodies in mammals. Harvesting antibodies from eggs laid by immunized chickens is much less invasive and only requires the collection of eggs rather than blood sampling in mammals. Furthermore, the sustained high and long-lasting antibody titer in chickens reduces the need for frequent booster injections and is, therefore, more advantageous in the consideration of animal welfare (G\u00fcrtler et al., 2004; Najdi et al., 2016; Schade et al., 1992). In contrast to IgG, IgY does not either interact with mammalian Fc receptors or activate the complement system, so it does not mediate inflammatory responses or interfere with immunological assays. Due to the long phylogenetic distance between avian and mammals, chickens can more efficiently produce antibodies against highly conserved mammalian proteins. This also requires much less antigen to prompt an effective immune response (Nilsson et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2011). Chickens, thus, can be considered as convenient, cost-effective, and rich sources of specific antibodies that have been applied successfully for immunodiagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic purposes in recent years.",

The photoperiodicity was also controlled at 14 h lighting and 10 h darkness. The breeding conditions were approved by the Shiraz University Policy on Animal Care and Use. The birds were adapted to the new environment for two weeks prior immunization. Salmonella spp.-free status was confirmed by bacteriological analysis of cloacal swabs (ISO, 2002), bacterial culture, and PCR technique on arrival date. The mentioned tests were repeated every two weeks throughout the experiment. For immunization, 0.25 mL of whole bacterial suspension (1.0 \u00d7 109 CFU/mL) was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) in the first immunization and 0.5 ml was injected into the quails\u2019 superficial pectoral muscles. Groups 1 to 4 were immunized as follows; group 1, formalin-inactivated S. typhimurium (FIST), group 2, heat-inactivated S. typhimurium (HIST), group 3, formalin-inactivated S. enteritidis (FISE), and group 4, heat-inactivated S. enteritidis (HISE).

In the fifth and sixth immunizations, the booster injections were carried out in the absence of adjuvant. Incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant is considered to be one of the most effective adjuvants that widely used in subsequent immunizations for consistently producing high titer antibodies. However, it may produce severe chronic local inflammation and causing skin ulcerations. Therefore, after four immunizations with Freund\u2019s adjuvants and in order to minimize theses adverse effects, the adjuvant was removed in the last two immunizations. All immunizations were conducted at two weeks interval. The control group (group 5) was administered with 0.25 mL of sterile PBS plus 0.25 mL adjuvant, except for the last two immunizations that sterile PBS was injected without adjuvant.

            "text": "In this study, the possible production of immunoglobulin Y specific to Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis in quail egg yolks and its utilization on ELISA and Western blot as a diagnostic tool were investigated. The SDS-PAGE analysis of purified antibodies revealed high purity and quantity of the product at about 25 kDa as a light chain and a 68 kDa as a heavy chain. These results were confirmed by the findings reported by Kassim et al. (2011) and Bae et al. (2009) who obtained two bands of light and heavy chains of quail IgYs at the same molecular weight. Therefore, egg yolk antibody purification method proposed by Kitaguchi et al. (2008) can achieve high yield and purity of IgYs in quail. Specific IgYs against S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis resulted from either heat or formalin-inactivated immunogens were started to increase in egg yolks from the second week after the first immunization. Since chickens transfer the maternal antibodies to the egg yolks for the protection of the embryos as a passive immunity, the lag time observed in the first two weeks may stands for the time it takes specific antibodies to be produced and transferred from the serum to the egg yolks. Antibody responses increased steadily from day 14 to 49 in all groups and reached a peak at day 49, following the fourth immunization. Second antibody production peak was observed at day 84 in FISE, HISE, HIST groups and day 70 in FIST group. Comparing the groups immunized with heat or formalin-inactivated antigens, relatively stronger immune responses were obtained against formalin-inactivated immunogens. Subjecting the bacteria to the 100 \u00b0C for 20 min for producing heat-inactivated immunogen would denature the outer membrane protein (OMP) which may serve as one of the main antigenic factors, involved in stimulating the immune system, as well as an epitope for the antibody. Therefore, heat may affect the antibody responses and also antigen-antibody binding possibilities by changing the antigenic epitopes. In accordance with our results, previous researches also reported the higher immunogenicity of formalin-inactivated antigens over the heat-inactivated ones regarding different bacteria (Kassim et al., 2011).",

Quail IgYs have been produced against Influenza HIV-1 viruses (Kovgan et al., 1989), Plant potyviruses (Somowiyarjo et al., 1990), Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus (Kassim et al., 2011), and Helicobacter pylori (Najdi et al., 2016). Kassim et al. (2011) investigated the possible production of specific egg yolk IgY against Vibrio SPP. in Coturnix quail. Specific IgYs started to increase in egg yolks from the 14th day after the first immunization and the highest titer was reached at day 35 for V. vulnificus and day 42 for V. parahaemolyticus. The second antibody production peak was observed at day 63 for both immunogens; then, the peaks were followed by an irreversible decline in spite of the booster immunization. Formalin-inactivated immunogens induced higher immunoresponses in both quails immunized with V. vulnificus or V. parahaemolyticus over those immunized with heat-inactivated immunogens (Kassim et al., 2011). This result is in agreement with the pattern we observed in quails immunized with Salmonella SPP.",

The first and the second peaks of anti- H. pylori IgY were observed at days 35 and 56, respectively. This study revealed that higher doses of antigen could not definitely develop higher immune responses and that the oral administration of antigen could generate an effective immunization in quail (Najdi et al., 2016). In contrary to this research, a reduction in antibody level was observed at day 56 in all groups immunized with S. typhimurium or S. enteritidis. Subsequently, antibody titer was recovered from day 63 following the 5th immunization. Variations in antibody production patterns among different studies might be due to the differences in individual immune responses, type and dose of antigens, route of antigen administration as well as the specificity and sensitivity of the tools used for assessing the antibody level.",

In the case of anti-S. enteritidis IgY, the highest and lowest cross-reactivity were observed with S. typhimurium (65.1%) and M. haemolytica (12.05%), respectively. Generally, quail anti-Salmonella IgYs showed a high specificity to their corresponding immunogens, with moderate binding affinity to other members of Enterobacteriaceae family (p < 0.05). The high cross-reactivity of anti-Salmonella IgYs observed between S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis can be explained by the fact that Salmonella serovars share many epitopes (Kudrna et al., 1985). Chalghoumi et al. (2008) used the outer membrane protein of S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis as a target of immunization and reported a high cross-reactivity of up to 78.8% for anti-S. typhimurium IgY to S. enteritidis, and up to 71.7% for anti-S. enteritidis IgY against S. typhimurium (Chalghoumi et al., 2008). The observed values of cross-reactivity of quail anti-Salmonella IgYs were lower than those reported in hens. We used the inactivated whole bacteria cells for the immunization in quails while hens were immunized with purified OMP. It is more likely that the degree of cross-reactivity directed against a purified immunogen like OMP, with more shared epitopes among Salmonella spp., is higher than that directed against a whole bacteria cell.",

They are less expensive, easily manageable in terms of housing, and experimentally convenient due to their small size (Bae et al., 2009; Scholtz et al., 2010). Quails require fewer volumes of antigens for immunization which is an advantage for producing antibodies against viruses and recombinant proteins that can be purified at low concentrations (Somowiyarjo et al., 1990). They achieve sexual maturity at seven weeks of age as opposed to the 20\u201324 weeks required for a hen to start laying eggs. Moreover, quails have a high rate of egg laying (280\u2013300 eggs per year), and immunization does not result in the reduction of egg production (Bae et al., 2009; Najdi et al., 2016). However, despite having several advantages, only few studies have utilized quails for investigating the immune responses against pathogens.",
