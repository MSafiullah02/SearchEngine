However, the wide tropism of SARS-CoV-2 means that multiple specimen types may be used to detect the virus in patients. Here, we found that a modified CDC LDT performed equally well in different sample matrices on an analytical basis. Our results also confirm prior work on the high analytical sensitivity of the N2 primer set [23]. Notably, the N2 target appeared to be most sensitive in SARS-CoV-2 detection in CSF with an LoD of 1 copy/reaction.",

Contemporaneous work has similarly established no difference in analytical sensitivity between NP swabs and BAL, with an LoD at 6 copies/reaction using the CDC assay [26].",
