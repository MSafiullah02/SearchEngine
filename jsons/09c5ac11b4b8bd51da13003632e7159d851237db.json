Theoretical risk of \"viral\" dissemination in the operating theater is higher during AGP than in hysteroscopy where the theoretical risk is extremely low, or negligible. Always favor the use of mechanical energy over thermal generating devices. Also, when needed, use conscious sedation or regional anesthesia to avoid the risk of viral dissemination at the time of intubation/extubation. Health care providers must comply with a step by step reimplementation of standard operating procedures, expediting the evaluation and management of all the deferred cases as soon as the benign pathology consultations can be safely restarted.

            "text": "than one patient is scheduled to be at the facility at the same time, ensure that the facility provides adequate space to ensure the appropriate social distancing recommendation between patients. Avoid the presence of multiple individuals in the waiting room at any given time. Ensure to space the seating in the waiting room at least 2 meters apart. Hand sanitizers and face masks should be available for patients and companions. We recommend the use of face masks by all individuals present in the hysteroscopic unit (patients, companions and staff members). The masks should always be worn and not only during the hysteroscopic procedure.5.It is imperative that all healthcare members in close contact with the patient during the procedure wear personal protective equipment (PPE), which would include an apron and gown, a surgical mask, eye protection and gloves. Extreme caution should be implemented to avoid contamination. Healthcare providers should always wear PPE deemed appropriate by their regulatory institutions following their local and national guidelines during clinical patient interaction.6. The use of electrosurgery in hysteroscopy is performed in a liquid environment. Bubbles that are generated with the use of thermal energy devices (monopolar, bipolar or laser) are cooled down rapidly and partly absorbed by the surrounding liquid (17). Cell fragments generated are contained within the uterine cavity (18). Any gases volatile at 37 o C or lower and cell fragments are actively suctioned through the outflow channel, in a closed circuit, without aerosol generating effect, minimizing any risk of viral dissemination. In addition, it is recommended to avoid multiple insertion and removal of the hysteroscope from inside the uterine cavity. 7. The participation of learners and physicians in training should be organized by video transmission and not by physical presence in the office or operating room. 8. In the case of patients with confirmed positive COVID-19 infection and in need of urgent hysteroscopic surgery, the operation should be performed under strict protective conditions ideally in an operating room with negative pressure and independent ventilation. 1. Hysteroscopy performed in an Office Setting: 1. Pre-procedural recommendations a. Patients should be advised to come to the office alone. If the examination requires a companion, a maximum of one companion to the appointment can be accepted. When coming to the unit alone, it is recommended that patients ensure secure transportation that can pick them up after the visit is over, to avoid driving immediately after the procedure. b. Limit the number of the health care team members present in the procedure room.",

Intra-procedure recommendations a. Limit the personnel in the operating room to a minimum. b. Staff should not go in and out of the room during the procedure c. When possible, use conscious sedation or regional anesthesia to avoid the risk of viral dissemination at the time of intubation/extubation d. Choose the device that will allow an effective and fast procedure. e. Favor non smoke generating devices such as hysteroscopic scissors, graspers and tissue retrieval systems. f. Active suction should be connected to the outflow, especially if when using smoke generating instruments to facilitate the extraction of surgical smoke 3. Post-procedure recommendations a. When more than one case is scheduled to be performed in the same room, allow enough time in between cases to grant a thorough operating room decontamination. b. Expedite post-procedure recovery and patient's discharge c. After completion of the procedure, remove scrubs and change into clean clothing if available.",
