The application of increasingly rigorous containment measures allowed to reduce the impact of the CoViD-2019 pandemic on the Italian National Health System but at the same time these restriction measures gave also the opportunity to assess the effect of anthropogenic activities on air pollutants in an unprecedented way. This paper aims to study the impact of the partial and total lockdown (PL and TL, respectively) on air quality in the Metropolitan City of Milan. As results, the severe limitation of people movements following the PL and the subsequent TL determined a significant reduction of pollutants concentration mainly due to vehicular traffic (PM 10 , PM 2.5 , BC, benzene, CO, and NO x ). The lockdown led to an appreciable drop in SO 2 only in the city of Milan while it remained unchanged in the adjacent areas. Despite the significant decrease in NO 2 in the TL, the O 3 exhibited a significant increase, probably, due to the minor NO concentration. In Milan and SaA the increase was more accentuated, probably, due to the higher average concentrations of benzene in Milan than the adjacent areas that might have promoted the formation of O 3 in a more significant way.",

On the 21 st February 2020, the total of cases identified by the health authorities in Lombardy was 34 (Lombardy Region, 2020) . This prompted the Government to declare the area of the outbreak \"red zone\", progressively limiting travel, social, cultural and economic activities of more than 50,000 people (DPCM, 2020a; IMH, 2020a) . Due to the rapid rise of infections, on the 23 rd February 2020, a new ordinance from the authorities resulted in the closure of all schools and placed restrictions on social and economic activities throughout the Lombardy region (IMH, 2020b).",

The chosen period for the PL is from the 9 th to 22 nd of March 2020, when schools and universities were completely closed and movements in a large part of northern Italy were limited only to strictly essential needs and to reach the workplace (DPCM, 2020b, 2020d). The days from the 23 rd of March to 5 th of April have been identified as indicative of the TL, since the implementation of more rigid measures that have forced the closure of almost all production activities and therefore a further limitation of movements (DPCM, 2020c).",

This aspect is essential considering that weather phenomena have a massive influence on air quality (Baklanov et al., 2016; Borge et al., 2019; Demuzere et al., 2009; Jhun et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2019) . January was not considered suitable for the identification of the reference period due to the high relative humidity, and low average temperatures (Tab. S3), different conditions than PL and TL which would have led to an imbalance in the comparison of some polluting agent trends (e.g. PM 10 and SO 2 ) due to the massive use of heating systems (Barrington-Leigh et al., 2019; Pillarisetti et al., 2019) . As shown in Figure 3 , in February temperature, relative humidity, wind, precipitation and average solar irradiance in the daylight hours were similar to those of March. Therefore, the CTRL period was chosen in the first part of February (from 7 to 20) next to the closing time of schools and universities and exhibiting comparable meteorological conditions with PL and TL (Table S4) MeCiMi sections. In the PL phase, the reduction of PM 10 was between 32.7% (SaA) and 40.5% (SaB). It was likely attributable to the significant reduction in vehicular traffic given by the transfers restrictions imposed by the Authorities considering that transports represent the main source of PM 10 in Milan and in the whole MeCiMi (40.7 -45%) ( Figure   S1 ). The TL period marked a further overall decrease in PM 10 of 13.1% -18.9% compared to the PL. This result can be partially attributed to the stop of industrial activities that allowed reducing direct emissions and, consequently, decrease workers' transfers. In both periods, the contribution given by the reduction of building heating cannot be neglected.",

As in the case of PM 10 , the influence of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 reduction of other combustion processes due to domestic heating cannot be excluded as household heating in MeCiMi determines the 28 -34.5% of the total PM 2.5 emission ( Figure S1 ). BC is produced by the incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fossil fuels, biomass and vegetation, representing a unique primary tracer for combustion emissions. BC is strongly recalcitrant and, given its low mobility, it tends to have a lognormal dispersion within 200 m from the traffic source, thus being considered by many studies as an excellent indicator of air quality in urban environments (Ali et al., 2020; Invernizzi et al., 2011) .

Furthermore, the reductions recorded in MeCiMi agree with the results obtained in the lockdown period imposed by CoViD-19 in Barcelona (from 47.0 to 51.4%) , and confirmed by Copernicus satellite system highlighted the substantial reduction of tropospheric NO 2 in Milan (with a reduction of 47\u00b115 %) when compared with March 2019 (ESA, 2020).",

The growth of O 3 is usual during spring and summer owing to higher solar radiation (in terms of intensity and daily duration), which promotes the photolysis of NO 2 (Escudero et al., Wang et al., 2020) . Figure 7 shows the dependence of the concentration of O 3 in CTRL, PL and TL on solar radiation and daylight hours. The increase in daylight hours (from 9.5 \u00b1 0.2 h in the CTRL period to 12 \u00b1 0.2 h in the TL period) might appear a crucial factor causing higher O 3 concentrations. However, this aspect is not sufficient to explain the data. ",
