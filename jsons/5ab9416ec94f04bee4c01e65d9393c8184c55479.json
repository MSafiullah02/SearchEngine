This protein is used by the virus to join with the host cells and initiates the relationship between them when the cell receptors link. Amino acids 1 through 439 are responsible for the attachment of the virus to the cell receptors causing a fusion of the viral and cell membranes (Gaudin et al. 1993; Gaudin et al. 1999 ). The three protein-type membrane receptors for the rabies virus that have been identified are (1) the nicotinic receptor for acetylcholine, (2) the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor, and (3) the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). These receptors are implicated in the adsorption of the rabies virus and the promotion of infection directly into the nerve ends and/or gangliosides located in neurons or at the point of axoplasmic transport of muscles. The virus moves along the dorsal ganglions and spinal cord; the brain is quickly infected causing apoptosis of the nerve cells and T cells (Lafon 2011) . A total of five antigenic sites have been identified in the soluble region of the protein: I, II, III, IV, and \"a,\" which are located in residues 231, 330-338, 264, and 342-343, respectively. The antigenic site II, located in position 34-42 and 198-200, had (Benmansour et al. 1991) . Furthermore, the presence of a residue of the Glu amino acid in position 333 has been related with the invasion of neurons and pathogenicity (Wunner 2002) ; the lack of this amino acid causes nonrecognition of the virus and the strains become nonpathogenic. It has been proposed that amino acid changes within the antigenic sites of the G protein could be the source of variants that are capable of escaping the host's defenses and providing adaptation to new environments (Kobayashi et al. 2010; Khawplod et al. 2006 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 99, "end": 116, "text": "(Ross et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 480, "end": 500, "text": "(Gaudin et al. 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 501, "end": 519, "text": "Gaudin et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1115, "end": 1127, "text": "(Lafon 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1387, "text": "34-42 and 198-200, had", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1412, "text": "(Benmansour et al. 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1569, "text": "(Wunner 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1888, "end": 1911, "text": "(Kobayashi et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 1912, "end": 1932, "text": "Khawplod et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Structure of G Protein"}, {"text": "The G protein is a target of T lymphocytes and induces the formation of neutralizing antibodies against the virus (Loza-Rubio et al. 1998; Morales et al. 2006) .

This is based mainly on the restriction of T-cell migration and the deficiency in professional antigen-presenting cells (Lafon 2005) . Protection against the rabies virus is mediated by the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies and/or T lymphocytes (helper CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+). Although it is possible that the protection against an infection by the rabies virus is the result of various effector-host interactions, virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNA), which are mostly produced against the G protein, play an important role in (Schnell et al. 2010) .

Furthermore, the G protein, besides inducing the formation of virus-neutralizing antibodies, also promotes the production of helper and cytotoxic T cells. It has been shown in intracerebral challenges that its structure is critical for both actions, the induction of neutralizing antibodies and protection (Drings et al. 1999; Hooper et al. 1994) . The function of these T cells during rabies infection is to help in the induction of B cells and the production of antibodies, as well as to act as cell effectors in cytotoxic cell immunity response (Jackson 2003) . After capture by macrophages and other antigen-presenting cells, antigens of the rabies virus are presented to CD4 or CD8 cells.

In the case of wild rabies, specifically in foxes, the first massive oral vaccination was carried out in 1978 within the Rh\u00f4ne Valley in Switzerland and later it was extended to various other territories. This distribution was carried out manually using vaccine-laden bait (12-25 bait/km 2 ) within endemic zones (Wandeler 2000 , Bugnon et al. 2004 ). The first recombinant vaccine was the VR-G developed in 1984 in which the sequence of the G gene was inserted into a plasmid together with the Vaccinia promoter and flanked by the viral thymidine kinase gene. This plasmid was used to transfect cells that had been previously infected with a wild Vaccinia strain, and using homologous recombination, it was possible to obtain the recombinant plasmid (Kieny et al. 1984; Paolazzi et al. 1999 .

The full G gene of the virus was cloned into the BIN19 vector downstream of the 35S CaMV promoter. Later, tomato cells were transformed by infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The expressed glycoprotein was purified by immunoprecipitation from leaves and fruits, and two bands, one of 60 kDa and another of 62 kDa, were detected with Western blot. This variation in protein weight could be due to differential glycosylation in the plant cell. The amount of recombinant glycoprotein in leaves was between approximately 1 and 10 ng/mg of soluble protein, while fruits had lower amounts.

It was perceived as a species with great potential for producing an edible vaccine. The vector used for the transformation of the plant was pGHCNS. G gene rabies virus was cloned downstream of the promoter and the maize ubiquitin promoter 35ScaMV. The expression cassette was flanked by matrix attachment region (MARs). Maize embryogenic calluses were transformed with the above construction by biolistics. Regenerated maize plants were recovered and grown in greenhouse. The presence of the G gene and its products was detected in vegetal tissue by PCR and Western blot. A fine powder was prepared from transformed grains and administered as pellet (50 \u03bcg of recombinant G protein). Other groups of mice were immunized intramuscularly with 50 \u03bcg of G protein using a commercial vaccine. All mice were challenged intracerebrally at day 90 post-vaccination using a vampire bat rabies virus which is used to evaluate commercial vaccine in Mexico.

Because of all this, legislation is necessary, both at global and local levels, on the research and development of biological products using transgenic plants as a platform. In this regard, Hungary became the first Central European country to adopt legislation on the regulation of genetic engineering activity. Its Gene Technology Law entered into force in January 1999 with the concomitant establishment of an advisory body (The Gene Technology Committee). Subsequently, several countries of Central and Eastern Europe adopted regulations about genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Before 2000, the differences between the US and the European community in their approach to the regulation of biotechnology had arisen because of the different initial cognitive frameworks, a different level of trust in the government, and the dissimilar agro-political situation. The dissimilar cognitive frameworks arise primarily because many Europeans appear to view the environment as a fragile ecosystem that may be easily unbalanced by transgenic plants. In contrast, the dominant view in the United States is of a resilient environment that can easily adapt.

Another such word that should be avoided is \"mutation\" since it is associated with an organism that causes harm and that it is against nature, association that comes about due to its use in science fiction.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Public Perception"}, {"text": "The use of biolistics as a method for plant genetic transformation and the use of plant expression vectors with constitutive promoters helped to achieve the development of carrot and corn plants that express the G protein of the rabies virus. These plants were successful antigen production systems. According to the results obtained in this study, it was found that the G protein expressed in the plant systems under evaluation was functional, even though it had suffered some posttranslational modifications. When immunity assays were carried out, it was found that corn tissue was the most effective in providing greater protection when challenged with rabies virus from hematophagous bats, which are the main transmitter of this virus in Mexico. Results show that both carrot and corn are convenient systems for the expression of the G protein since good expression levels were achieved and such levels would allow the production of a subunit vaccine. Nevertheless, the expression of the N protein in tomato plants was not satisfactory. It is noteworthy that the use of biolistics allows permanent expression since the transgene is integrated into the plant genome and from there it segregates into future generations thus obtaining a good candidate for an edible vaccine against the rabies virus in animals and humans.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "This study allows us to visualize a rabies vaccine derived from plants since it was demonstrated that plant cells from both species under evaluation are capable of expressing the G protein of the virus in sufficient quantities.
