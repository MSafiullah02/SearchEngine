S1P is a lipid with a particular aminoalcohol structure, known as sphingosine which binds to S1P1-5 receptors [2]. These receptors are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), in which the N-terminal of the proteins forms an amphipathic binding pocket by crafting a helical cap hindering ligands to access the binding pocket [3]. However, it is believed that LPLs attain their binding sites through the cell membrane instead of extracellular region [4].",

After conversion to the phosphate form, fingolimod activates S1P1, S1P3, S1P4 and S1P5 receptors. Although the exact roles for S1P4 and S1P5 receptors remain unclear, the adverse effects of fingolimod are attributed to the activation of S1P3 receptor [11]. Therefore, in different studies several selective S1P1 receptor agonists have been synthesized in order to retain the therapeutic properties of S1P1 receptor agonists with the minimum side effects [5,12,13].",

However, the most rate limiting step in 3D-QSAR studies is the obtaining of appropriate ligand alignment. The Grid-INdependent Descriptors (GRIND) offered an alternative approach in 3D-QSAR analyses in which the alignment of ligands is not required. Instead, the products of interaction energies for each pair of MIFs are used to build the models [15]. There are several examples of successful application of alignment-independent 3D-QSAR methods using GRIND descriptors where the results were comparable to GRID based alignment-dependent studies [[16], [17], [18], [19]].",

Therefore, this compound, currently known as ponesomid, was selected for in vivo studies, in which it could significantly reduce circulating lymphocytes in rat. The current study aimed to generate GRIND-based 3D-QSAR predictive models for agonist activities of these 2-imino-thiazolidin-4-one derivatives both on S1P1 and S1P3 receptors in order to identify structural features relevant for the selective activation of S1P1 over S1P3 receptors.

The quality and geometrical features of the obtained model was checked using PROCHECK and MolProbity programs [[23], [24], [25]]. Then, the 3D coordinates of the antagonist in complex with S1P1 receptor were used to dock the studied ligands into the S1P1 receptor crystal structure using GOLD program (version 5.0, CCDC, Cambridge, UK) running under LINUX operating system [26,27].To determine the ligand binding site on S1P3, the modeled S1P3 receptor structure was aligned on S1P1 receptor-antagonist complex and a new merged complex was built consisting S1P3 receptor and the antagonist. Finally, the position of the antagonist in the new complex was used as the guide for determining the binding site in docking calculations. ChemPLP scoring function in GOLD program was used for the docking calculations. Docking of the experimentally co-crystallized antagonist into the binding site of S1P1 receptor resulted in a solution with 0.51 \u00c5 RMSD to its experimentally observed position. Therefore, for all other dockings the same scoring function was used. The best active conformations for the most active compounds in data set (i.e. compounds 61 and 14 for S1P1 and S1P3 receptors, respectively) were selected based on their docking scores. The best conformers for the rest of compounds were selected based on the maximum shape similarity to the most active compound (i.e. compounds 61 and 14 for S1P1 and S1P3 receptors, respectively) using Tanimoto algorithm implemented in Shape-it program [28].",

Finally, the encoding of MIFs were processed by the Consistently Large Auto and Cross Correlation (CLACC) algorithm [31] which resulted in more consistent variables compared to Maximum Auto- And Cross-Correlation (MACC) method. The obtained values were then used for generating correlogram plots in which the product of node-node energies is represented against the distances between the nodes. The selected variables were used to build 3D-QSAR models using partial least square (PLS). The generated models were checked from the quality point of view by internal cross validation methods. Fractional factorial design (FFD) method was employed to extract the most relevant variables to the compounds activities. FFD selection was repeated several times on the models until no improvement in the statistical parameters (r2, q2and SDEP values) was observed.",

As seen in Fig. 4\nDRY-N1 (10.4\u201310.8 \u00c5) variable connects thiazolidine ring to hydroxyl moiety at the most end of the structure indicating that the presence of an hydrophobic region (for example thiazolidine ring in compound 61) at the distance of 10.4\u201310.8 \u00c5 from a hydrogen acceptor group (i.e., hydroxyl group in compound 61) positively influences the biological activities as well as the selectivity of the studied compounds towards S1P1 receptor. On the other hand, analyzing the PLS coefficients revealed that the positive impact of DRY-N1 variable is higher for the compounds 02, 04, 21, 23, 25, 25, 26, 28, 29, 59 and 62 whose selectivity towards S1P1 is higher compared to the compounds 44, 45, 46, 56 and 58 as the least selective compounds towards S1P1 over S1P3 receptor. Another selectivity inducing variable, DRY-O (12.4\u201312.8 \u00c5), connects a hydrophobic region (i.e., thiazolidine ring in compound 61) to a hydrogen donor group (i.e., etheric oxygen in compound 61), far apart 10.4\u201310.8 \u00c5 from each other which adversely affects the S1P1 receptor agonistic activity. The impact of this variable is lower for the S1P1 selective compounds such as compounds 22, 25, 42, 60 and 62 which are the S1P1 selective compounds rather than S1P3 receptor. Taking into account all these explanations, it seems that DRY-N1 and DRY-O variables can be considered as the S1P1 receptor selectivity-introducing factors for the studied compounds.",

The molecules identified by similarity search (1706 structures) were docked on the binding site of S1P1 and S1P3 receptors. The agonistic activities for the best docking poses of the identified molecules were predicted based on the developed 3D-QSAR models. The results demonstrated that compounds 400 (PubChem ID: 136647497), 452 (PubChem ID: 72785505), 798 (PubChem ID: 18758433) and 799 (PubChem ID: 18758427) could bind to S1P1 receptor with predicted EC50 values of 0.65, 3.63, 1.35 and 0.68 nM, respectively, while their predicted affinities towards S1P3 receptor were estimated to be considerably low (Table 7\n). Comparing the predicted affinities towards S1P1 and S1P3 receptors showed excellent selectivity for compound 452 (S1P3 EC50/S1P1 EC50: 13489). This level of predicted selectivity is comparable with the selectivities reported for S1P1 agonists in clinical trials such as ozanimod [19] and siponimod [40] and much greater than that of compound 61, indicating that compound 452 is noteworthy to be evaluated in experiments for development of a potent and selective S1P1 agonist. Moreover, among the selected compounds, compound 799 showed high predicted EC50 value (0.68 nM) with acceptable S1P1 over S1P3 selectivity (5888 times), demonstrating its feasibility to be explored as a potent and selective S1P1 agonist. Overall, it seems that the selected compounds from PubChem search can be considered as promising selective and potent S1P1 receptor agonists.",

            "text": "The 3D illustrations of the obtained best docking pose for compounds 61, 400, 452, 798 and 799 in complex with S1P1 receptor are shown in Fig. 6\nand compared with S1P1 receptor co-crystallized antagonist. As seen in Fig. 6, compound 61 from the data set interacts differently with the receptor compared to S1P1 receptor co-crystallized antagonist and the compounds identified from PubChem search. However, the latter compounds bind the same site as the antagonist, which may indicate their capability of S1P1 receptor recognition. Analyzing the chemical structures of the selected compounds reveals some important details about the observed results in terms of predicted potency and selectivity of these structures. Table 8\nsummarizes the physic-chemical properties of the selected compounds in comparison to compound 61, S1P, ozanimod, and siponimod. The analysis shows that those compounds more hydrophobic than compound 61 have higher predicted activities, which may be attributed to the easy penetration of more lipophilic compounds into the innermost binding site of S1P1 receptor (Fig. 7\n). In an effort to identify the interaction modes of agonists with the receptor, the 2D illustrations of the bindings were generated using Discovery Studio Visualization (version 17.2.0) program (Fig. 8\n). The results revealed that the binding of compounds 400, 452, 798 and 799 with S1P1 receptor are dominantly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. Site directed mutational studies have revealed the importance of Arg120 and Glu121 residues located at the extracellular end of third transmembrane helix of S1P receptors in signal transduction [41,42]. Gonzalez-Cabrera et al. showed that ligands not interacting with both Arg120 and Glu121 residues or interact just with one of them can exert agonistic activity with improved specificity [43]. 2D analysis of the identified ligands docked into the binding site of S1P1 receptor (Fig. 8) revealed that they do not interact at a time with Arg120 and Glu121. These observations are in agreement with the selective agonistic S1P1 activities predicted for the identified compounds obtained from database search [43,44]. Moreover, the identified compounds also interact with Phe210 and Trp269 residues, which are known essential for agonistic activity as confirmed by the point mutagenesis studies [3]. Further, these ligands interact with Leu276 and Met124 at the binding site of S1P1 which are S1P1 selectivity-inducing residues over S1P3 and S1P4 receptors, respectively [3]. The identification of the selective S1P1 receptor agonists demonstrated in the previous section outlines the potential for selectivity predictions based on the above mentioned qualitative descriptions of the binding modes to S1P receptors defined implicitly in the developed 3D-QSAR models. The interesting finding regarding the most selective compound (452), identified based on PubChem similarity search, was that it binds and inhibits E protein from Human coronavirus. This protein plays a central role in virus morphogenesis and assembly and acts as a viroporin and self-assembles in host membranes forming pentameric protein-lipid pores that allow ion transport. The experimental studies have shown that compound 452 binds to the transmembrane helical segments of E protein. Although, there is no apparent similarity between E protein and S1P1 receptor sequences, both of them are helical transmembrane proteins. The docking studies conducted in this work identified the core of the helical bundle of S1P1 receptor (a member of 7 transmembrane GPCR superfamily) as the binding site for 452, which is in agreement to the experimentally identified binding site of this compound formed by transmembrane helical bundle of pentameric E protein. The alignment between profiles prepared for S1P1 receptor and E protein using their closely related sequences and the known secondary structural information revealed that E protein can be aligned with the 5th transmembrane helix of S1P1 receptor as demonstrated in Fig. 9\n. Although not very conclusive, but one may state that the binding sites available on S1P1 receptor and E protein for compound 452 could share similar environment.",
