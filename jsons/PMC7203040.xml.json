Images of struggling hospitals in some of the wealthiest countries continue to fill news cycles, showing government plights of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) shortages, low stock and unsatisfactory distribution of ventilators, and cries over the capacity to treat critical patients. Entire hospitals constructed within a matter of weeks with adequate resources on stand-by have drawn praise for the responsiveness of healthcare services in these regions. Within these countries, the pandemic has proven challenging, as well as stretched the capability of their existing systems.",

COVID-19 has the potential to cripple such systems, including areas where strides have been made to strengthen current systems and improve provision. This is even more desperate when reviewing the context and situation within temporary healthcare settings, from field hospitals in regions of conflict to clinics situated within refugee camps.",

Having worked in 23 different countries and delivered more than 95 healthcare projects to date, the organisation drew on its medical expertise and available resources to formulate four comprehensive and practical checklists. The checklists, which are freely available online, focus on preparedness for COVID-19 and are tailored to healthcare work in humanitarian and low resource settings. At present the checklists have reached both settings in 15 countries across Sub-Saharan and East Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. Additional support is provided to offer hands-on training on the checklists' usage and in-country supervisory learning in various locations. The checklists are summarised in greater detail below.Checklist 1: Prepare Logistically\n",
