Recent advances in molecular virology have led to the discovery of previously unrecognized respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 4, human coronaviruses (HCoV) HKU1 and NL-63, and human bocavirus. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2013based testing has allowed detection of newer agents and improved the ability to detect old viral infections, such as influenza virus and rhinovirus (Table 1\n). Widespread use of newer vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae has changed the epidemiology of childhood and adult pneumonia. These changes have led to recognition of the greater and more widespread role of respiratory viruses in CAP in all age groups. Although not addressed in this article, respiratory viruses are a very important cause of severe pneumonia and respiratory failure in patients who are immunocompromised, particularly recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplant.1, 2\n",

RSV has been detected in 3% to 31% of children hospitalized with CAP. The incidence and severity varies with age; younger children are generally more likely to have RSV-associated pneumonia and are the most severely affected. Important studies in the mid-1990s demonstrated that RSV was an important cause of CAP in adults.4, 5 Dowell and coworkers5 studied noninstitutionalized adults admitted to two Ohio hospitals and found that 53 (4.4%) of 1195 adults admitted during the RSV seasons and 4 (1%) of 390 in the off-season had serologic evidence of RSV infection. RSV has been identified in 4% to 7% of adults with CAP.6, 7, 8, 9 RSV-associated CAP seems to be more common and severe among older adults.10 Using viral surveillance, hospitalization, and mortality data, Zhou and colleagues11 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that the rate of hospitalization for RSV for persons older than 65 was 86 per 100,000 persons per year, compared with a hospitalization rate for influenza of 309 per 100,000 in that age group. RSV was listed in the discharge codes in fewer than 2% of the hospitalizations for RSV among older persons, suggesting marked underrecognition. RSV causes substantial mortality. Thompson and colleagues12 estimated that during the 1990s, RSV was associated with an average of more than 11,000 deaths each year in the United States. Most of these deaths were in persons older than 65.",

More than 50 serotypes have been described. Adenoviruses cause a wide variety of infections, including conjunctivitis, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, pharyngitis, URI, pneumonia, meningitis, hepatitis, and gastroenteritis. Conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, or rash may be present with pneumonia and provide a clue to the cause, but this is uncommon. Serotypes differ in tissue tropism and their tendency to cause severe respiratory disease, although the mechanisms for this are poorly understood. Severe respiratory disease is associated with adenovirus serotypes 5, 7, 14, and 21. Historically, adenovirus pneumonia has been primarily documented among children; immunocompromised adults33; and outbreaks in hospitalized patients34, 35 and healthy adults in closed settings, such as military recruits.36, 37, 38 However, severe disease can occur in immunocompetent adults.39 The genetic diversity of adenoviruses has limited the sensitivity of culture and PCR-based diagnostics, so the true rate of adenoviral pneumonia may be underestimated.",

All four HCoV show distinct winter seasonality. They are associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in all age groups.52, 53, 54 In a prospective study from Scotland that included a control group of patients with no respiratory symptoms, HCoV HKU1, HCoV NL63, and HCoV OC43 were isolated significantly more often from patients with lower respiratory tract infections than from control subjects, supporting the etiologic role of these viruses.52 In a prospective study of hospitalized patients with pneumonia in Thailand, coronaviruses were detected by PCR in 5.9% of 734 patients in the first year of the study. However, in the second year when a control group was included, coronaviruses were detected in only 1.8% of 1156 patients and were detected in 2.1% of control subjects.55 Thus, this study did not demonstrate an epidemiologic association of coronaviruses with pneumonia, but it is unclear if this was caused by variation in intensity of the season. In a prospective study of patients with severe pneumonia undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage about half of whom were transplant recipients, coronaviruses were detected in 5.8%, mostly as the sole pathogen.56 Thus, the role of coronaviruses in pneumonia has not been completely clarified but it seems clear that they cause some cases of CAP in normal hosts and cause severe pneumonia in transplant patients.",

Rhinoviruses were long known to cause common colds, otitis media, asthma exacerbations, and exacerbations of COPD, but lower respiratory tract infections were thought to be rare, perhaps because of the belief that rhinoviruses grow poorly at 37\u00b0C.

Shedding generally does not persist beyond 2 to 3 weeks, but few studies have done careful molecular subtyping, making it difficult to separate shedding from reinfection. The rates of rhinovirus detection in asymptomatic patients are generally substantially lower than among patients with lower respiratory tract infection or pneumonia. In a review of published studies of viral detection in asymptomatic subjects, Jartti and coworkers3 found a mean rate of rhinovirus/enterovirus detection by PCR of 15%, with higher rates among children and very low rates (2%) among the elderly. In preliminary results from the CDC Etiology of Pnemonia in the Community (EPIC) Study, rhinovirus was detected in 31% of 1320 children hospitalized with CAP and 22% of 442 control children who were undergoing elective surgery.",

Human bocavirus is a recently described parvovirus that has been frequently detected in respiratory secretions of children with respiratory tract infection.71, 72 The role of bocavirus in CAP remains unclear. Interpretation of human bocavirus detection has been complicated by relatively common detection in asymptomatic children and prolonged detection after infection. However, in a study of Thai patients hospitalized with pneumonia, Fry and colleagues73 found that compared with control patients, detection of human bocavirus was associated with hospitalization for pneumonia. Four patients with human bocavirus and pneumonia were older than 65. However, 83% of pneumonia patients with human bocavirus had coinfection with another pathogen. Brieu and coworkers72 detected human bocavirus in 10.8% of 508 children hospitalized with respiratory illness and none of 68 control subjects. Pneumonia was diagnosed in four of the children with human bocavirus. Most bocavirus-infected children had a coinfection, but viral loads were higher in the mono-infected children. Christensen and coworkers74 detected bocavirus in 10% of 1154 children with respiratory tract infection and a similar proportion of control subjects. Of those with bocavirus, a second virus was detected in 75%. Bocavirus viral load greater than 106 copies/mL was not associated with respiratory infection; higher viral load was however associated wlth LRTI. Thus, the exact role of bocavirus in pneumonia remains unclear.",

The apparently lower proportion of S pneumoniae has led to speculation that viruses now cause an increasing proportion of CAP in adults.

            "text": "\nTable 3 summarizes six prospective studies that included viral PCR to determine the cause of CAP in 1762 hospitalized adults (a small number of outpatients are included in the study by Templeton and coworkers48). At least one virus was detected in 15% to 54%. In the five studies that reported bacterial causes, bacterial pathogens were detected in 20% to 58% and coinfection was detected in 4% to 30%. Viral infections are generally a more prominent cause of CAP among older adults.81 Johnstone and coworkers8 reported that patients with viral infections were significantly older than those without viral infections (median age, 76 vs 64 years), and were more likely to have underlying cardiac disease (66% vs 32%) and to be frail. Influenza virus was among the most commonly detected viruses in adults hospitalized with CAP, detected in 4% to 12%. RSV was detected in 2% to 7% of adults. Influenza and RSV detection were highly seasonal. Detection of rhinovirus/enterovirus varied from 2% to 17%, but these viruses were often detected as a coinfection. Parainfluenza and coronaviruses were detected at variable rates (0%\u20138% and 2%\u201313%, respectively). HMPV and adenovirus were somewhat less commonly detected (0%\u20134% and <1%\u20134%, respectively). A putative pathogen could not be detected in 24% to 61% of patients in these studies despite the use of multiple methods including PCR for detection of viruses. This proportion is considerably higher than in studies of CAP in children, but the reasons are unclear. Possible explanations include a greater role of bacterial infection for which current diagnostics remain inadequate, the greater role of viral infection and coinfection in children, greater incidental detection of viral shedding in children, or lower viral copy number in the nasopharynx of adults with viral infections of the lower respiratory tract, making detection more difficult.",

Toikka and coworkers90 found that procalcitonin (median, 2.09 vs 0.56 ng/mL; P = .019) and C-reactive protein concentrations (96 vs 54 mg/L; P = .008) were significantly higher in children with bacterial CAP than those with sole viral cause, but there was substantial overlap. Nascimento-Carvalho and coworkers,89 however, reported that a cutoff of procalcitonin less than 2 ng/mL had a negative predictive value of 95% for excluding bacterial infection. In adults, procalcitonin levels are also higher in bacterial pneumonia.91 However, procalcitonin values are not static; they increase rapidly during bacterial infection and fall during appropriate therapy. To get around the limitations of a single cutoff value, treatment algorithms using sequential procalcitonin levels have been studied in several randomized trials as a way to guide therapy.88, 92, 93 For a complete discussion see the article by Niederman elsewhere in this issue.",

However, the evidence base is not optimal. Two classes of drugs are available for the treatment of influenza virus infection: the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantidine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir [Tamiflu] and zanamivir [Relenza]). Widespread and stable resistance to the adamantanes has rendered this class of limited use.96 Oseltamivir and zanamivir were initially studied in randomized controlled trials among adults and children with uncomplicated influenza.97 These studies demonstrated reductions in the time to the primary endpoint of resolution of all symptoms of approximately 1.25 days when neuraminidase inhibitors were begun within 48 hours of symptom onset; larger benefits were seen for return to functional status. Few patients with risk factors for complications were enrolled in these studies and with low rate of events the individual studies did not demonstrate reductions in hospitalizations or pneumonia. Kaiser and coworkers98 performed a pooled analysis of oseltamivir clinical trials including 1340 patients, and reported statistically significant reductions in the development of lower respiratory tract infections resulting in antibiotic use and in hospitalizations and a nonsignificant reduction in pneumonia. Although statistically significant, the absolute risk reductions in generally healthy patients were relatively modest.",

Detection of influenza infection can clearly lead to use of antivirals and in most cases limit the use of antibiotics. The use of sensitive and specific influenza tests is appropriate for children and adults with CAP during influenza season, and is recommended in recent guidelines.133, 134 In younger children with moderate to severe CAP and immunocompromised patients viral pneumonia is common and testing for an array of viral causes of pneumonia can direct therapy and improve infection control. However, additional studies are needed to determine the impact of viral testing in other groups. The combined use of biologic markers and viral testing holds the promise of correctly identifying patients for whom antibiotic exposure can be safely limited.
