Present testing solutions are based on the extraction of RNA from patients using oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, and then testing with real-time PCR for the presence of specific RNA filaments identifying the virus. This approach is limited by the availability of reactants, trained technicians and laboratories. To speed up the testing procedures, some attempts have been done on group testing, which means that the swabs of multiple patients are grouped together and tested. Here we propose to use this technique in conjunction with a combinatorial replication scheme in which each patient is allocated in two or more groups to reduce total numbers of tests and to allow testing of even larger numbers of people. Under mild assumptions, a 13\u00d7 average reduction of tests can be achieved.",

Quarantine and personal isolation have been applied nearly worldwide. Such restrictions can be made both less stringent and more effective if tests can early detect the presence of infectious individuals. The scarcity of reactants, accredited laboratories for virus testing, and trained technicians have so far severely limited the number of tests. At the moment of writing, although randomized sampling has not yet been implemented on geographical scale by any country, some attempts are going to be implemented soon to understand the real prevalence and stratification in population by one of the countries that has been first affected by the pandemic outbreak, namely Italy. Such attempts suffer from the aforementioned limits in testing capabilities, and therefore only a sample with a size in the order of hundred of thousands individuals can be obtained, with no longitudinal data.",

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is then used to detect and evaluate the abundance of proteins that are virusspecific. In order to test as many people as possible, studies have shown the possibility of group testing [1] , which means that the result of the test is given for a group of people, rather than for a single patient. In the simplest case, this might be applicable to people living in the same apartment, or sharing the same working spaces. In case of a positive person in a group, each individual in the group is singularly tested. It is easy to show that, at low levels of prevalence, such methodologies can provide a decrease in the overall number of tests needed, when compared with individual testing. In some studies, the possibility of using replicas is also analyzed [2] . Pool replicas organize patients in such a way that when one patient is positive, it is possible to directly identify him or her from the positive pools. In case of high prevalence in population, multiple positive patients might appear in the same pools, and other individual tests are necessary to identify them.",

Therefore, we propose an optimized allocation of patients in duplicated pools in order to decrease the total number of tests and the time needed to obtain the results.

We developed an automatic tool to allocate patients to replicated groups that, under certain assumptions, directly provide the information on the positive person in a group [4] .
