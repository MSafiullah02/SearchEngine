The technician had provided dental treatment to the complainants' horse which included the use of power tools under sedation. The complainants alleged that the equine dental technician caused undue suffering to their horse which ultimately led to the horse's death. Expert evidence was obtained by the Board which indicated that the horse had suffered from acute pulp exposure and subsequent pulp necrosis and tooth death. The most likely cause of the damage was considered to be the inappropriate or excessive use of power equipment. The veterinarian in this case had been contracted to perform the sedation only. Nevertheless, the Board held that the veterinarian was the supervising vet and had a duty to act at all times to ensure the welfare of the horse. As the supervising veterinarian there was a responsibility to ensure that any procedures carried out did not put the horse's health or welfare in jeopardy. The Board found the veterinarian failed to adequately supervise the equine dental technician and the treatment provided to the horse compromised its health. The veterinarian was found guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct and issued with a caution. Oversupply and dwindling incomes pose a threat to the ability of Australian veterinarians to provide quality animal welfare services.",

            "text": "Qualified veterinarians, having undertaken five or more years of full-time university study in one of the most expensive courses offered by universities, enter a profession currently offering one of the lowest salaries for professionals in Australia. With a private practice average salary of around AUD$67,000, it is also significantly worse than the North American average of USD$121,000. 3 Of even greater concern is that veterinary salaries have been decreasing compared with the Australian national average for the past 30 years 4 and graduates unable to find fulltime employment have doubled in the past five years. 5 The high incidence of stress and depression within the veterinary profession has recently been the subject of some research. Although the causes of this are multifactorial, finances appear to be a pivotal factor, with suggestions that lack of pay rises and low pay rates are the greatest cause of dissatisfaction among veterinarians. 6, 7 Veterinarians are four times more likely to commit suicide than the general population and twice as likely as other high-risk health professionals, such as doctors and dentists. 8 Onethird of medical general practitioners committing suicide have financial difficulties and the statistics are likely to be similar within the veterinary profession. 8 The Australian government was advised that future need for veterinary services could be met with four veterinary schools, but this recommendation has gone unheeded. 9 There are now seven schools, with an expected increase in graduates of 50% from 2008 to 2013. This is in addition to a near 100% increase in the number of registered veterinarians from 4757 in 1991 to 9700 in 2009. Australia already has at least 30% more veterinarians per capita than the USA and UK. 1 A fundamental concept of basic economics is that of supply and demand. Price of veterinary services (and in this case, wages of veterinarians) reflects the supply-demand relationship in this industry. Given the existing price competition between clinics and decreasing wages of veterinarians, we have an oversupply of veterinarians and veterinary clinics in Australia.",

            "text": "The corollary of this is that veterinarians will eventually be forced to abandon the profession due to a combination of factors stemming from low wages and lack of employment. This is undoubtedly devastating news to individuals who have already invested much time and money in completing an arduous and expensive university degree. Switching to another professional career (such as law, medicine or dentistry) takes significant time and self-funding, leaving students with massive debt, difficulties in starting a family and delaying eventual retirement. Universities should be informing potential students of the anticipated financial debt and expected career outcomes prior to course entry. 10 Hourly wages for veterinarians in rural areas are lower and the hours longer due to the vast distances between clients. There is also a reliance on income from lower numbers of companion animals. Average farm expenditure is only AUD$200 per year on veterinary fees. 9 in Western Australia rely on non-veterinary income to support themselves. 11 Wages and lifestyle are the predominant reasons cited for leaving rural practice. Contrary to some reports, there is no shortage of rural veterinarians, but there is low demand for veterinary services and a lack of clients willing to pay appropriate fees to support rural veterinary practice. In North America, the American Association of Bovine Practitioners has taken a more sensible approach, publicly releasing a statement in regard to the false information on supply-demand and wages, clarifying that there is no shortage of rural veterinarians. 12 Some have suggested the oversupply will abate due to increased female part-time workers, large numbers of rural veterinarians retiring from the workforce and expansion into other disciplines such as aquaculture and biosecurity. Wage trends, current veterinarian numbers and retraction of government veterinary employment, from 50% to 10% in the past 50 years, collectively refute such statements. 4, 5, 9 In one study, 92.4% of pre-veterinary and veterinary students wanted to work in general practice on graduation. 6 The stress of the pay rates and on-call hours are not recognised until after commencement of employment when some may consider nonpractice careers. 6 By this stage there is a competitive disadvantage in the job market for non-practice positions because knowledge is out-of-date and graduate training programs are no longer possible in these other areas. Additionally, the intensive number of university contact hours during semesters and clinic rotations makes the completion of traditional internships and cadetships in non-practice areas more difficult. Challenges of transitioning to alternative employment may contribute to a feeling of entrapment, which has been determined as a stress factor in veterinarians. 8 Veterinary deans are concerned about decreasing graduate quality due to faculty funding and poorly perceived rewards from a veterinary degree. 3 Further decreases in practitioner quality could be expected if the course is diversified to increase graduate skills in non-practice areas. With the expanding length of veterinary degrees, it is possible that ambitious individuals may seek non-veterinary pathways where it is easier and quicker to achieve high marks, postgraduate qualifications (Masters or PhD) and work experience in specific animal health fields, such as aquaculture and public health. The international veterinary profession is currently experiencing increased market tension with paraprofessionals such as equine dentists, 13 online pharmacies 14 and even lawyers 15 taking on tasks and responsibilities previously the preserve of veterinarians.",

The reasons for this include trends towards over-servicing, increased reliance on industry-funded continuing education, sales of non-evidence-based therapies to support income, inability of clinics to purchase quality equipment and hire capable staff, paraprofessionals performing veterinary duties and an exodus of talent from the profession as disillusioned veterinarians seek jobs that are more rewarding, both morally and financially.We currently face the prospect of private practice veterinarians comprising inexperienced recent graduates, individuals trapped by the burden of student debt, practice owners with high capital investment, secondary household income earners and those who are satisfied raising a family on the lowest of finances or happy to retire at a late age. Instead of working in the veterinary industry, people who wish to advance the welfare of animals would instead pursue more highly valued and highly paid professions, and simply donate to respectable animal charities. For the benefit of the veterinary profession and allied animal welfare in Australia, it is sincerely hoped that this situation does not occur.",
