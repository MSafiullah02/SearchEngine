            "text": "\nOver the last 30 years the recombinant DNA revolution has catalyzed our discovery of fundamental principles in biology, which continue to lead to translational applications in human medicine and agriculture. This new era started in 1975 when a small group of scientists, recognizing the potential for recombinant DNA technology to work for and against humankind, met at Asilomar to discuss a way forward [1]. A self-imposed moratorium on recombinant DNA research gave way to experimentation following the principles of the Asilomar Conference, and codes of practice formulated by national bodies in various countries with significant input from scientists [2]. This resulted in the development of a transparent, best-practices system of science that assured the potential of recombinant DNA research could be achieved in a safe manner, and remains a model for regulation of science by scientists [3]. In the United States, the first iteration of the Recombinant DNA Research Guidelines (National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines) were drafted with public input in 1976 by a National Institutes of Health federal advisory committee that eventually became known as the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) (see also Chapter 12) [4]. Initially the RAC reviewed all Principal Investigator (PI)-initiated proposals (referred to as registration documents) that involved recombinant DNA, but since 1978 the review and approval of most registration documents has been conditionally delegated to the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) at research establishments (see also Chapters 2 and 12Chapter 2Chapter 12). The drafted NIH Guidelines were not static and were modified as new technologies were developed, and as our understanding of risk evolved from intuitive to empirical based on new knowledge. Led by CDC and NIH initiatives, the NIH Guidelines were the starting point in a partnership with the life sciences community to develop a code of practices for biosafety in microbiological and biomedical laboratories. In 1984 this collaboration resulted in the publication of Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL)\n[5].",

The rise of nonstate-sponsored terrorism in the latter part of the last century, the recognition that biotechnology was pervasive, and that life sciences research had a dual-use nature, required new approaches to identify and evaluate the research risk. In response to this and other threats, the government enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (see also Chapters 1 and 2Chapter 1Chapter 2). Together this legislation made it illegal to possess biological agents or toxins for nonpeaceful purposes. With regard to the most dangerous pathogens and toxins known as biological select agents and toxins (BSAT), these acts mandated their registration, criminal background checks for users, a regulatory system for storage and transportation, and the creation of a class of \u201crestricted persons,\u201d who were prohibited from their access (see also Chapter 10). Because implementation of this legislation could have the unintended consequence of making the United States more vulnerable to bioterrorism by slowing or blocking the development of the very diagnostics, prophylactics and therapeutics that are needed to protect the country from bioterrorism, the National Research Council of the National Academies of Sciences formed the Committee on Research Standards and Practices to Prevent the Destructive Applications of Biotechnology. The charge of this committee was:\u2026to prevent the destructive application of biotechnology research and to recommend changes in these practices that could improve U.S. capacity to prevent the destructive application of biotechnology research while still enabling legitimate research to be conducted.Ref.

Of its seven recommendations, recommendations 1, 2, 4, and 5 were pertinent to the IBC. Recommendation 1, arguably one of the most important, proposed comprehensive education of persons involved in life sciences research with BSAT with regard to the dual-use dilemma. The remaining three recommendations focused on the actual system of regulation of DUR with BSAT. Recommendation 2 suggested that the IBC, which already reviewed experiments involving recombinant and synthetic DNA and infectious agents, would also review DUR with BSAT that belonged to seven categories (see below). Recommendation 4 proposed the creation of a National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB). The NSABB was proposed to provide case-specific oversight of research and its communication and dissemination, if relevant to national security and biodefense (see also Chapter 6). In addition, it would act in an advisory capacity to alert the government to novel findings that have national security implications. Furthermore, the NSABB would serve as a resource providing education outreach [7], [8], advice to journals concerning DUR (e.g., 2011 influenza A/H5N1 gain-of-function controversy), and international engagement with scientists and professional organizations [9]. Furthermore, the NSABB would conduct periodic review of the implementation of current legislation and existing regulation to ensure an optimal balance is maintained between stimulating life-sciences research, and ensuring national security (recommendation 5). And finally, the NRC 2004 Report recognized the key role federal funding would play in the development of this new system:\u2026successfully implementing the system \u2026will require significant additional resources at each stage; we do not attempt to provide an estimate of those costs. Otherwise, concerns for unfunded mandates could be a significant barrier to full consideration of the proposal by the scientific community.Ref. [6]\n",

A well-publicized example of DUR that can be considered DURC came from a project that used ectromelia virus to develop an immune-contraceptive vaccine for wild mice. Ectromelia virus is a risk group 1 agent that is 95% identical to variola virus at the nucleotide level and is used to model smallpox infections. Ectromelia virus was modified by recombinant DNA techniques to express a gene for murine zona pellucida glycoprotein-3 (ZP-GP-3), which is part of an extracellular matrix surrounding the developing mammalian oocyte. Upon infection of mice with this ectromelia-ZP-GP-3 recombinant virus, the immune system of the mouse recognized the ZP-GP-3 as a foreign antigen, and synthesized antibodies against it. These anti-ZP-GP-3 antibodies subsequently attacked the developing oocyte and ovaries of the mouse resulting in sterility of about 6 months duration. This is an example of DUR that arguably meets the definition of DURC as it provides a \u201croad-map\u201d for the construction of a recombinant virus based on existing knowledge and techniques that could infect and transmit efficiently in human populations resulting in sterility [13]. At the time this research was published it received little attention, underscoring how difficult it is to recognize DUR, and emphasizing the need for a comprehensive and mandatory education program for DUR and relevant policies as called for in the NSABB 2007 Report.",

Because of the narrow focus of the 2015 DURC Policy, one of the two studies of the 2011 influenza A/H5N1 gain-of-function controversy would not have been covered by that policy even though both studies examined gain-of-function mutations in the influenza A/H5N1 hemagglutinin (H) that contribute to transmissibility of influenza virus between ferrets. The study from the Fouchier laboratory at the Erasmus Medical Center utilized a natural isolate, influenza A/H5N1/Indonesia/5/2005 virus that was genetically modified by site-directed mutagenesis of the H surface protein, and the acquisition of additional mutations by subsequent serial passage in ferrets [15]. This study would be explicitly covered by the 2015 DURC Policy. On the other hand, Kawaoka and colleagues at the University of Madison used receptor-binding studies and animal experiments to identify four mutational changes to the same H protein when expressed in a virus containing the remaining seven gene segments from a 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus [16]. A whole 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus or one containing the gene for the H of the more pathogenic influenza A/H5N1 virus is not covered by the 2015 DURC Policy, even though the Kawaoka virus construct was based on a 2009 influenza A/H1N1 virus that is highly communicable and few humans are thought to have protective immunity to H of influenza A/H5N1 virus. This arbitrary exclusion of one of two studies from enhanced review when both employ a similar gain-of-function approach and seek to answer the same experimental question supports the idea that all life sciences research should be evaluated at the institutional level for DURC as proposed by the NSABB 2007 Report.",

Influenza A/H5N1 virus is included in the 2015 DURC Policy, whereas coronaviruses (CoV) severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern rsespiratory syndrome (MERS) are not. SARS initiated a ~9-month global pandemic in November 2002 that resulted in 8096 infections, 774 deaths and a case-fatality rate of 9.6% [17]. MERS-CoV, emerged in 2012 and as of June, 2015, has caused 1342 infections, 513 deaths, and a case-fatality rate of 38% [18]. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have infected more individuals in a shorter period of time (cumulative ~3 years) than influenza A/H5N1 virus, which is credited with 842 clinical infections, 447 deaths, and a case-fatality rate of 53% between 2003 and 2015 [19]. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are readily transmissible in human populations, while influenza A/H5N1 virus is not. These examples underscore a problem with the current USG approach for regulation of DURC. The reliance of the 2015 DURC Policy on a list of 15 BSAT suggests other potential pathogens are of less importance, and has the inherent danger of creating a false sense of security [20]. The 15 BSAT list may be expanding as in October of 2014 the USG announced a pause in DURC gain-of-function research projects (2014 Funding Pause) that would enhance the pathogenicity and/or transmissibility of influenza virus, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV in mammalian species by the respiratory route of infection.

Both the Fouchier and Kawaoka groups selected a gain-of-function experimental approach to search for genetic changes in the H5 that would permit efficient transmission of an influenza A/H5N1 virus between ferrets, a model of human influenza virus transmission. Of the experimental approaches available for answering this research question, gain-of-function is the most direct and time-proven. Understanding the factors that governed the evolution of influenza A/H5N1 virus transmission between humans has important implications for public health. If the research failed to identify mutations that enhanced transmission in the ferret model, it could suggest the existence of a genetic barrier to creating a highly transmissible influenza A/H5N1 virus. Influenza A/H5N1 virus infections for humans would be destined as \u201cdead-end\u201d interactions, as are infections with hemorrhagic disease viruses such as Lassa fever and Junin viruses. In this regard, a number of influenza virus researchers believe only influenza viruses with H subtypes of H1, H2, or H3 are capable of pandemic potential. A failure to demonstrate ferret transmissibility with mutated influenza A/H5N1 virus could support a reduction of investments in pandemic preparedness and research for influenza A/H5N1 virus. For example, worldwide at least five vaccines have been licensed against influenza A/H5N1 and more are in development.

The seven individuals infected in the BSL-2 containment laboratories may not have used respiratory protection as it is not required by the BMBL\n[5], whereas the four LAI from the BSL-3 laboratories would have employed no, N-95 type, or PAPR respiratory protection. The BMBL mandates respiratory protection only for research activities in ABSL-3 facilities, whereas the need for respiratory protection for BSL-3 facilities would be determined by the IBC risk assessment [5]. Without knowing the respiratory protection of the individuals who were infected, it is difficult to use the data to calculate probabilities of a LAI occurring as a result of influenza A/H5N1 research in BSL-3 Enhanced containment laboratories where the PAPR is the universally prescribed method of respiratory protection. Importantly, PAPR provides almost 100% protection against an aerosol infection when operating properly [27]. Similarly, the Henkel publication provided the number of individuals working in all of the reporting BSL-2, BSL-3, and BSL-4 containment laboratories, but did not attribute an individual number to each biosafety level. And, finally, influenza A/H5N1 virus experiments are carried out at BSL-3 Enhanced, which contain a number of additional safety features over BSL-3 that would minimize the frequency of exposures and the probability of a LAI.",

In order to continue to improve best practices for biocontainment and biosecurity, it is especially important to have accidental exposure data (or the lack thereof) from the new state-of-the-art BSL-3/4 National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center and Integrated Research Facility at Frederick, MD, and from similar facilities in other countries.

The NIH Guidelines delegate review and approval of registration documents conditionally to the IBC. The NIH Guidelines require certain experiments that potentially involve DURC (Table 13.2) to require additional levels of review. For example, the deliberate transfer of a drug resistance trait to a certain microorganism could require IBC review, RAC review, and NIH Director approval prior to initiation of the study (NIH Guidelines, Section III-A). Also, the cloning of a toxin molecule with LD50 of less than 100 ng/kg requires IBC and NIH/Office of Biotechnology Activities (NIH/OBA) approval (NIH Guidelines, Section III-B). The NIH Guidelines also recognize that certain influenza virus studies involving genes from 1918\u20131919 H1N1 (1918 H1N1), human H2N2 (1957\u20131968), and influenza A/H5N1 viruses require special consideration (enhanced biocontainment), but not additional review.

The IRE uses a risk\u2013benefit assessment analysis to determine whether proposed research is DURC. If the research is determined to be DURC, the PI, working in conjunction with the IBC, would draft a risk mitigation plan to guide the conduct and communication of the DURC. The risk mitigation plan would need to be approved by the USG funding agency. This approach raises at least three questions. First, would using the agency that funded the project to review a risk mitigation plan be a conflict of interest? Second, what individual(s) or group of individuals would carry out the review? For example, would the program officer operate in another capacity to review the risk mitigation plan or would it be someone who was trained in risk-benefit analysis? And third, how would independent funding agencies ensure consistent reviews of mitigation plans for an identical DURC?",

Under this framework an influenza A/H5N1 virus gain-of-function research proposal would be reviewed for Scientific Merit and dual-use issues by the funding agency. If the proposal is in the fundable range, and passes the seven-point DHHS criteria, it would be forwarded to DHHS for a further rigorous review based on scientific and public health benefits, biosafety and biosecurity risks, and risk mitigation plan. If the research project passes the DHHS review process, the funding agency is approved to send the PI a notice of award. The 2013 DHHS framework also raises numerous questions, three of which are listed here. Would the funding agencies require an IBC reviewed registration document, including a risk\u2013benefit analysis and risk mitigation plan, to accompany the funding solicitation? This would make sense as otherwise the DHHS review committee would have to generate de novo the risk\u2013benefit analysis and the risk management plan for each project it reviewed. Although perhaps advantageous for the DHHS review committee, this approach would increase the IBC workload as most IBCs review registration documents only after the award of funds as ~80\u201390% research proposals are not funded. If the DHHS review committee did generate its own risk\u2013benefit analysis, would the IBC be able to modify a DHHS-approved risk mitigation plan or would the DHHS risk\u2013benefit assessment replace that aspect of the IBC review? And, finally, would the DHHS risk mitigation plan replace the need for the risk mitigation plan mandated in 2015 DURC Policy, since the plans likely would end up in the same place, that is the funding agency? It is not clear how this will work in practice, but the PI and IBC will have additional responsibilities and reporting requirements when these policies and guidelines take effect.

Identified DURC would be managed by a risk mitigation plan developed by the IBC and PI, with no additional level of review described. The NRC 2004 Report proposed review of DUR involving BSAT at the level of the IBC. For most DURC an acceptable risk management plan would be developed between the PI and IBC, however, the authors of the NRC 2004 Report recognized that certain DURC would have a greater degree of inherent risk, and would require an additional level of review. Based on the success of the NIH Guidelines at facilitating research while protecting public safety, the NRC 2004 Report proposed a similar hierarchical review process for evaluating DURC.

The increased responsibility is based partly on recent USG policy expanding its review role for DURC with the 15 BSAT. Our view is that IBC review of DURC should be expanded even further than mandated by the 2015 DURC Policy to include all of life sciences research. Although this would further increase the workload of the IBC, it would result in a more comprehensive picture of DURC in life sciences research, especially research carried out in laboratories that have low to no biosafety containment and biosecurity. An example of this type of research leading to DURC is the immune-contraceptive ectromelia-ZP-GP-3 recombinant and the vaccine proof ectromelia-IL-4 recombinant described above. IBC expanded review would also eliminate the gaps in current 2015 DURC Policy by regulating research with all pathogens with pandemic potential, not just pathogens currently on a \u201clist.\u201d The DUR dilemma is now at least 25 years old, and although it has not been adequately addressed, in many ways it is an old debate.

The IBC is well suited to explain to local communities the review process, including the risk\u2013benefit assessment that is a component in the evaluation of DURC. A series of USA Today articles have suggested that not all of the nation\u2019s biocontainment laboratories are being operated in a safe and secure manner [31]. This comes at a time when trust between the scientific establishment and the public is already strained due to the inadvertent shipment of live Bacillus anthracis\n[32] and live influenza A/H5N1 virus [33] from CDC laboratories; the shipment of Bacillus anthracis from the Army\u2019s Dugaway Proving grounds in Utah over a 12-year period to at least 194 laboratories in all 50 states, Washington, DC, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and nine other countries [34]; and the release of Burkholderia pseudomallei from a high-containment BSL-3 laboratory at the Tulane National Primate Research Center [35].

In addition, synthetic biology offers the possibility to modify microorganisms by the addition of functional \u201cgenetic circuits\u201d and metabolic pathways for such practical purposes as the production of pharmaceuticals and biofuels, to break down pollutants, and, in the longer term, to create new life-forms [39]. And finally, in agriculture the continual increase in the world\u2019s population under changing environmental conditions and decreasing water supplies will drive the plant biotechnological revolution to generate new solutions for food security (see Chapter 9 for crop-specific IBC issues) [40]. All of these new areas of research will require a certain level of oversight that the IBC is best positioned to provide.\n",

For this system to work effectively, the PI that prepares the IBC registration document will self-identify DUR that may be considered DURC. For its part, the IBC will need to separate DURC into projects that can be evaluated completely at the level of the IBC, and those needing secondary review by the expanded RAC. This process must be consistent among IBCs. Ideally, projects with similar DURC would be managed by similar risk management plans, even at different IBCs. Also, it would be advantageous for the local IBC to be staffed with the required subject matter experts such that each registration document receives a thorough evaluation. This could be difficult for some smaller institutions, and it would be important to have an expanded availability of commercial, virtual IBCs and/or a national register of trained ad hoc IBC members. Equally important, the PIs and members of the IBC must receive education and training on DUR, especially risk\u2013benefit analyses.",

The Office of Biotechnology Activities in the Office Scientific Policy at NIH sponsors a comprehensive website that provides education materials on DUR [42]. More recently, the 2015 DURC Policy directed that institutions must provide education and training for individuals conducting life sciences research with the 15 BSAT. In addition to these educational materials, members of the NSABB engage target audiences on the issue of DUR, and the Office Biotechnology Activities presents \u201cNIH Guidelines 101\u201d at the American Biological Safety Association\u2019s annual meeting and at other venues.",

Focusing largely on human and animal subjects\u2019 protection, the article presents a call to action, to consolidate regulatory activities, streamline duplicative and unnecessary reporting, and reduce costs. Other similar discussions in the literature are available [41], [44], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50]. Few would argue that any progress has been made in reining in regulatory burdens during the 13 years that followed this plea. In fact the problem appears to be getting worse.

Of particular interest was the observation that many researchers were more concerned about committing a violation than they were about personal injury. These data present a disturbing picture of the kinds of pressure (both personal and regulatory) that many users of the IBC may be experiencing, although the date of the survey (2009), only 5 years into the federal BSAT program, leaves room for the possibility that IBC regulations have since been clarified and attitudes have adjusted.",

In contrast, a similar accounting of papers focused on Klebsiella pneumoniae found a smaller decrease (from 26 to 17 research papers per millions of dollars of US funding). Thus, BSAT research activity dropped by 65%, while general pathogen research dropped by only 17%. While the authors recognized a number of problems with the analysis (so that the numbers may be \u201csoft\u201d), the data clearly indicated that there was a 2\u20135-fold decrease in certain BSAT research, as estimated by the number of BSAT research papers published in the United States.",

Many researchers complained that they had to use research funds to upgrade their laboratories to appropriate security standards [20]. Gaudioso and Salerno bemoan the loss of personal and institutional talent applied to BSAT research, and relate the flight from the field directly to the burdensome nature of registration and compliance; more than one high-profile researcher announced that they would change their research focus, rather than submit to the regulations [54]. BSAT requirements have grown only more restrictive and demanding in the ensuing years. Sutton [50] argues that researchers are the sole targets of current biosafety and biosecurity regulations; indeed, Sutton develops the argument that the alleged perpetrator of the anthrax attacks of 2001 would not have been detected under (then) current BSAT Program, and adds:It may be time to rethink the regulatory framework for the nation\u2019s biodefense research, focusing more on fully implementing the background investigation requirements and better perimeter security, and placing less emphasis on filling out forms, filing reports and counting units of self-replicating organisms (2009).\n",

Both direct and indirect costs of research represent real institutional expenditures. Direct costs, of course, are those elements that are readily identified (and represent the bulk of an award) in a research project, such as supplies, research equipment, investigator salaries, etc. Indirect costs are not so clearly linked to a given project, but include expenses for facilities, infrastructure, and operational activities (e.g., electricity, heat, ventilation, maintenance, disposal of hazardous waste), as well as costs associated with the administration of awards (e.g., compliance with regulations, cost controls and financial reporting, information security). In the case of research involving BSAT, there are additional indirect costs involved with security systems and personnel, maintenance of specialized engineering controls such as HVAC systems, administrative panels to evaluate the suitability of research-related personnel (\u201cpersonnel assurance programs\u201d), and the requirement for a Responsible Official to oversee program administration (see also Chapters 3 and 6Chapter 3Chapter 6). The impetus for the federal government to set Facility and Administration (F&A) rates, of course, was to support the indirect costs associated with the conduct of federally funded research. Hence, F&A rates are negotiated by institutions that receive federal funding, typically via audits that are undertaken (at an institution\u2019s expense) every 3 years. While an institution\u2019s F&A rate is subject to change (either up or down) over time, the maximum amount of administrative expenses that an institution can claim is capped at 26% of direct costs of a federal award, a rate set in 1991.",

Indeed, a range of suggestions emerged from a 2013 conference aimed at tempering some of the negative effects of the 2012 BSAT Regulations [42]:1.The USG and research institutions should jointly develop a new, systematic approach for promoting, supporting, and overseeing BSAT research.2.The USG should provide a funding mechanism to support maintenance of existing facilities and infrastructure upgrades (both physical and personnel security efforts) to meet the new security requirements for tier 1 BSAT.3.The USG BSAT Program should prepare letters of interpretation or frequently asked questions for the most prevalent and/or concerning security findings encountered during inspections, particularly when inconsistent findings have arisen.4.Increased training, communication, and flexibility amongst regulators and between institutions are needed to introduce consistency into the inspection process and uniformity in the implementation of the regulations.\n",

In one of the great ironies of our times, these advances carry not only enormous opportunities for discoveries that can improve human health, but also opportunities for such discoveries to be used as weapons. Balancing the benefits of such research against its risks is a critical undertaking for the scientists who make the discoveries, the institutions that support their work, and the society whose members endorse the scientific endeavor. In recent years, the costs of maintaining that balance have grown and are visited disproportionately on the institutions in which the scientific work occurs. For these advances to continue, a rebalancing of the historically successful university\u2013federal partnership is needed. We believe that the changes proposed in this chapter could rebalance that partnership and allow research institutions to remain viable enterprises, accommodating both scientific discoveries that can benefit human health and the precautions necessary to ensure the safety and security of the broader society.",
