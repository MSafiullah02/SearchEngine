The most common underlying conditions present in influenza C infected patients were cardiovascular and chronic pulmonary disease. None of these patients had immunocompromising conditions including transplant, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or recent chemotherapy. Two of the 13 samples had another virus codetected along with influenza C; 1 patient was coinfected with influenza A and another was coinfected with respiratory syncytial virus. No codetection with human metapneumovirus was found.",

With the recently reported outbreaks of influenza C in children, we evaluated a cohort of adults to determine if influenza C was significantly associated with heath care utilization, especially hospitalization, in older adults. Despite the reported disease burden in children, little medically-attended disease due to influenza C was appreciated in adults including older adults. Of the 2681 hospitalizations for acute respiratory illness over a 6-year period, only 5 (0.19%) were associated with influenza C. Our cohort included a substantial number of immunocompromised patients (96 transplant patients, 355 cancer patients, 13 asplenic patients). We hypothesized that influenza C might be more common in the immunocompromised adult population. However, in these populations, no adults were found to have influenza C. The most common underlying disorders in patients with influenza C were asthma or COPD (5 patients, 38%). Patients with detectable influenza C presented to the ED, hospitals, and an outpatient clinic, but the proportion of those with influenza C detected were higher in the outpatient setting (0.55%).",
