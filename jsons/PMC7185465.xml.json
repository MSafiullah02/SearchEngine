Improved understanding of U.S. OD markets can bridge the gap between macro-level strategic planning and micro-level network planning to support long-term optimization and stability. Aggregation at the macro-level leads to decision making that is calibrated by all of the U.S. OD markets. Our strategy is to analyze OD market peer groups, clustered by three intrinsic characteristics, to compare a market's risk and return relative to its peers. Today, airline planning is akin to a financial investor choosing to obligate additional assets to a given investment on the basis of that investment's prior performance (e.g., invest $100 in GOOG because it grew at 5% over the previous period) without consideration of the opportunity cost of investing that $100 (e.g., how is GOOG performing relative to other technology stocks, or the NASDAQ index).",

If the investor were to compare his holdings in similar companies, the investor makes better-informed decisions about the risk and return of his holdings relative to its peers. Similarly, airline network planners can apply portfolio thinking to analyze the risk and return of it investments (resource allocation) in its various OD markets (e.g., short-haul, high volume, business markets or long-haul vacation/leisure markets) to determine an acceptable level of risk and expected return over the long-term. Our research leverages financial portfolio thinking and statistical cluster analysis to enable comparisons across and within network clusters, allowing for a richer context in assessments of market performance.",

A common method to facilitate portfolio analysis is a growth-share matrix where the performance of products or companies is plotted with respect to their relative market share and market growth rate into four quadrants: split into high-low market share and high-low growth rate. Here we adapt the growth-share matrix concept to airline network planning. In order to assess performance within peer groups, we plot the OD markets within a peer group into four different quadrants based on the linear weighted averages of revenue growth and passenger volume stability to derive strategic implications for airline market portfolio development (Fig. 4\n). We adapt the growth-share matrix from market share and market growth to revenue growth and passenger volume stability in order to measure the volatility of the OD markets. The bubble size represents an OD's total annual revenue to consider its scale. Similar to the growth-share matrix, the quadrants are defined using the industry-median passenger growth rate and volatility. Qualitatively, the quadrants can be summarized as follows, clock-wise from upper-left:\u25ba\nNiche: low volatility and low growth, low volatility markets which have limited profit expansion opportunities\u25ba\nInvest: high growth, low volatility markets which consistently outperform the industry\u25ba\nQuestion Marks: high growth, high volatility markets requiring careful consideration of profit potential\u25ba\nDivest: low growth, high volatility markets which consistently underperform the industry\n",

We introduce a measure to \u201cnormalize\u201d the expected returns of the OD markets with respect to the risk associated with such an investment. In finance, this is most often based on the Sharpe Ratio (Sharpe, 1966), defined as:S=E[R\u2212Rf]VAR(R\u2212Rf)where S, the Sharpe Ratio, is the ratio of the expected difference in return from the asset, R, and the benchmark or industry average asset, R\nf, to the standard deviation of the difference in return from the asset and the benchmark. As a rule of thumb, a Sharpe Ratio of 1.0 is a favorable investment, 2.0 is a very favorable investment, and 3.0 is an excellent investment. The Sharpe Ratio maintains an R\n2 between .66 and .989 for each of the seven peer groups, verifying the efficacy of the Sharpe Ratio for airline network planning (Fig. 5\n). The slope of the line between a plotted OD market and the origin is the Sharpe Ratio for that particular market.
