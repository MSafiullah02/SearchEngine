            "text": "Polyoxometalates (POMs) are oxygen rich class of inorganic cluster systems exhibiting remarkable chemical and physical properties, which have been applied to various fields such as catalysis, materials and medicines [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. POMs perform significant biological activities, with high efficacy and low toxicity. In particular, the sizes and globular structural motifs of many POMs are similar, and in some cases nearly identical to some water-soluble fullerene derivatives showing fairly good anti-HIV activity (human immunodeficiency virus) [6], [7], [8]. So far, various biological effects of the POMs have been reported on antitumor and antivirus activities [9], [10]. With regard to the antibacterial activity of the POMs, we found that the polyoxometalates with Keggin, lacunary Keggin, Wells-Dawson, double-Keggin and Keggin-sandwich structures enhanced the antibacterial activity of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) [11], Helicobacter pylori\n[12] and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [13].",

A number of attempts have been made to disperse POMs on inert supports, with the goal of effectively increasing their surface areas and hence the number of accessible active catalytic sites. Several materials such as carbon [14], zirconia [15], titania [16], alumina [17] and porous silica [18], [19] have been used as solid supports for the dispersion of POMs. To find a suitable support able to attach itself firmly and to disperse the POMs would be of great practical interest because catalytic activity will be related to the higher surface area and to the thermal stability of the supported heteropolyanion.",

Among these, bamboo is recognized as one of the most popular bioresources, and its adsorption characteristics have been the subject of many studies [21], [22]. In our research work, we try to combine H5PV2Mo10O40 with bamboo charcoal, aiming to explore a kind of water-insoluble and biocompatible antimicrobials. In order to explore the antibacterial effects of BC/POM composites, zone of inhibition testing, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and the plate-counting method were used in this study to examine the antibacterial activity of the BC/POM composites against gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and E. coli JM109 (pUK18), and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis).",

The weight ratios of BC:POM prepared were approximately equal to 1:0.25, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3.

The test was performed three times for each strain, and results in agreement on two or more occasions were adopted as the MIC of the strain. After the MIC has been determined, 0.1 ml of inoculum from each of the tubes broth without visible turbidity was subcultured on nutrient agar plate and incubated at 37 \n\u00b0C for 24 h. The number of grown colonies on this subculture after incubation period was counted and compared to the number of CFU/ml in the original inoculum.

As shown in Fig. 1, BC/POM samples, the absorption bands assigned to the M\u2013Oc\u2013M and M\u2013Oe\u2013M stretching at 865 and 780 cm\u22121, respectively, are shifted to 873 and 800 cm\u22121. These results indicate that there were interactions between the BC particles and the POM. Fig. 2\nshows the UV\u2013vis spectra of the POM and BC/POM composites. The UV\u2013vis spectra of POM and BC/POM composites dissolved in solution show prominent bands at 217 and 309 nm, its intensity distinctly increased with increasing POM content.

            "text": "\n31P MAS-NMR is a useful tool in detecting the local environments of POM, since the chemical shift of the phosphorous atom depends not only on its local environment within the metal cluster but also on factors such as associated water molecules, metal ions and solid supports [28]. Fig. 3\nshows the 31P MAS-NMR spectra of unsupported bulk POM and BC/POM composites. All the samples displayed more than one phosphorus resonance, which indicates that the structure is complex. Bulk POM exhibited a sharp and intense peak at \u22123.3 ppm along with shoulders at \u22122.3 and \u22124.2 ppm, typical of Keggin structures [28]. The main peak indicates the presence of P in a highly uniform environment in a hydrated structure of POM. The small shoulders at \u22122.3 and \u22124.2 ppm are due to the presence of some P atoms in environments with different degrees of hydration [19]. After supporting POM on BC, the 31 P NMR signals broadened considerably and shifted to high field (\u03b4\n = \u22123.9 and \u22127.9 ppm). The up-field shift of the resonance signal suggests some destruction of the heteropolyanion. Therefore, the broadness of the 31P NMR resonances of supported samples can be attributed to a significant distortion of the heteropolyanion symmetry and the long-range order created by water molecules in the hydrated state is lost, due to a chemical interaction between the POM anion and mesoporous BC support [19].",

As shown in Fig. 4\n, ultra-fine and disaggregated POM particles were homogeneously distributed on the surface of the BC. Pure BC has a porous surface (Fig. 4A). The POM particles are granular in nature and seem to be nanosized, typically in the range of <100 nm (Fig. 4D). EDX analysis confirmed the existence of POM in the BC matrix and qualitatively revealed the POM nanoparticles content (Fig. 4E). Table 1\ngives the POM content, S\nBET and pore diameter of each BC/POM composite, and shows that POM content increased with increasing initial concentration of POM solution, pore diameter of the BC/POM composites was about 3.40 nm, and S\nBET of the BC/POM composites decreased with increasing POM content, due to the direct blockage of pores by POM particles. Particle size and S\nBET can be controlled by changing the POM content. Too small a value of S\nBET will lead to weak adsorption capability, rendering the BC/POM composite useless in the purification process. Thus, as the antibacterial activity of BC/POM composites is significantly influenced by the loading amount of POM on the BC particles, further studies should be performed to estimate the amount of POM required to suppress bacterial growth and ensure strong adsorption capability.",

After 24 h of incubation, the zones of inhibition of the BC/POM composites against bacteria ranged from 9.4 to 27.0 mm, whereas BC did not show any zone of inhibition. The BC/POM composites exhibited significant efficacy against bacteria, especially against S. aureus, MRSA and E. coli JM109, and the efficacy increased with increasing POM content. The results in Table 3, Table 4\nshow that the composites have good efficacy against these bacteria. The MIC and MBC values of the BC/POM composites against bacteria were 4\u2013128 \u03bcg/ml and 16\u2013256 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The BC/POM composites have a strong antibacterial activity regardless of gram class, including Ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA), E. coli JM109 and Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which are much more difficult to kill. Thus, it is likely that the highly negative charge of POM will stimulate the cell to result in the easiness of the bacterial morphological change from bacillary form to coccid form, reflecting the bacterial death [12]. In addition, the antibacterial efficacy of the BC/POM composites was better than that of zeolite/Ag (MIC: 256\u20132048 \u03bcg/ml) [29]. This result may be due to the uniform and fine POM particles distribution on the surface of the BC.",

Fig. 6 shows the relationship between samples and the number of bacterial colonies grown in the presence of 20 mg/ml of BC/POM composites. In all these samples, the particles caused a growth delay of S. aureus, and increasing the POM loading amount of the composite increased this growth delay. As demonstrated in Fig. 6E, the bacterial colonies of S. aureus were completely killed after 18 h of incubation in BC/POM-3 composite. The dynamics of bacterial growth were also monitored in liquid MH medium supplemented with 107 CFU S. aureus cells and with 50 mg/ml of BC/POM-1 inoculated for different lengths of time. Fig. 7 shows that the bacterial colonies of gram-positive S. aureus were completely killed after 24 h of inoculation and the percentage reduction of bacteria was approximately 100% after 8\u201360 h of inoculation. The mechanism for the antibacterial activity of the POM against gram-negative strains has been considered as follows: the fluorescent X-ray analysis results showed the uptake of the POM into the bacterial cell. The gram-negative strains can take the hydrophilic compounds into the periplasmic space through the porin protein, which is pore-form protein working for penetration of the hydrophilic compounds in the outer membrane [12].",
