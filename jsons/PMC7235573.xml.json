However, a higher risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death, promoted by the drug-induced QT-interval prolongation [4], is feared by the medical community.

The safety profile of chloroquine and analogs is favorable, although cardiovascular side effects are known, including hypotension, bradycardia, ECG changes such as QRS and QT-interval lengthening, and cardiac rhythm disturbance [8,10,11].

Differences in the speed of repolarization of the cell layers of the ventricles may produce transmural voltage gradients and heterogeneity of repolarization rates, which are the predisposing factors of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias like \u201cR on T\" premature ventricular beats and torsade de pointes [12].

Nonetheless, they did not experience any arrhythmic complications during the hospital stay, like syncope or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Interestingly, patients with QTc-interval longer than 480 ms showed higher levels of transaminase. This is not a novelty since a prolonged QTc interval has been previously reported in patients with liver disease, due to electrolyte imbalance, autonomic nervous system dysfunction with a prevalence of sympathoadrenergic activity, and increased plasma concentrations of cytokines and vasopressors [16]. Given that our COVID-19 cohort did not show any dysionia during the ECG recordings, it is reasonable to believe that the inflammatory response and the cytokines release were more severe in patients with higher levels of transaminase. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1), and interleukins IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, have a potential role in causing prolongation of the QT interval [17].",
