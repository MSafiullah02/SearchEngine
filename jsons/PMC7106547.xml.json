Far less data have been published that specifically address the impact of coronavirus (CoV) infection in these patients [9]. Lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) due to CoV has been described on a case-report level [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], but a retrospective analysis of 46 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from HSCT recipients with any acute pulmonary process did not identify CoV in any sample [3]. Later, a prospective surveillance study in allogeneic HSCT recipients performed at a single center over the course of one year found a relatively high cumulative incidence of CoV infection (11%) in the first 100 days following allogeneic HSCT, but only one case in which CoV was detected in a lower respiratory tract sample [15]. Other series studying the impact of respiratory viral infections have not specifically or directly assessed the clinical impact of CoV in patients with hematologic malignancies and HSCT recipients [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22].",

The clinical characteristics of CoV infection in these 28 patients were examined and compared to episodes of mono-infection with other respiratory viruses (PIV1-4, hMPV, RSV, and RhV/EnV) in the same patient population. The median age of those infected with CoV was similar to the other respiratory viruses analyzed. Surprisingly, CoV was identified significantly more often in females (64%) than males compared to hMPV, PIV1-4, and RhV/EnV, with a trend toward the same finding for RSV.",

While the frequency of respiratory illnesses in the general population has been described to be higher among females, perhaps due to increased exposure [27], if this was responsible for the higher burden of CoV infection among women compared to men, then a similar pattern might be expected for the other respiratory viruses as well.

However, these results must be interpreted with caution since bronchoscopy, which we used as a criteria for defining \u201cproven LRTD\u201d, is no longer done in many cases when a respiratory virus is identified in an upper airway sample at this institution or others [24]. Analyzing \u201cpossible LRTD\u201d instead, CoV was indeed associated with significantly less disease compared to all the other respiratory viruses analyzed except RhV/EnV, with the rate of possible LRTD due to the other respiratory viruses in this report being generally consistent with the published literature [9], [24]. However, not all patients had radiography performed at the time of diagnosis of respiratory viral infection, which may bias the results toward those more likely to have evidence of lower respiratory tract illness.",

Additionally, all cases occurred in the setting of acute or chronic GVHD. Taken together, these findings suggest that CoV may be inherently less virulent compared to other respiratory viruses, and therefore, requires augmented immune suppression after HSCT in order to progress to LRTD. The low number of CoV-associated LRTD in this study precludes meaningful risk factor assessment but additional studies may make this more feasible.",

Namely, 30% of outpatients were admitted to the hospital based on manifestations of CoV infection, and hospital acquisition occurred in 5 cases, with a cluster of 4 nosocomially-acquired cases occurring within a 2 month span. Additionally, 50% of CoV-infected patients received an empiric course of antibacterial therapy (data not shown). Notably, while CoV is detected as part of the respiratory virus panel used at our institution during the study period, the CoV results were not reported in the medical record since the assay was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. In theory, a \u201cnegative\u201d respiratory virus panel result may lead to more frequent admission to the hospital for further medical evaluation, antibacterial use, or nosocomial transmission. However, we found the rates of these events during CoV infection to be similar to those during infection with other respiratory viruses (Table 2 and data not shown), highlighting the overall impact of respiratory viral infections in these patients in terms of utilization of medical resources.",
