The recent threat of pandemic influenza outbreaks and anticipated increase in demand for seasonal influenza vaccine owing to expanded vaccination recommendations require evaluation of alternative non-egg based technologies for manufacturing influenza vaccines [5]. The production of the egg-derived vaccine is not easily scalable and is limited by the availability of chicken eggs [6]. The egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturing process is labor intensive requiring long term planning and long annual production cycles [7]. These difficulties in production scale-up and potential exposure of chicken flocks to avian influenza viruses have prompted the evaluation of cell culture vaccine production platforms as alternatives to egg dependent production [8].",

In addition to MedImmune's cloned MDCK cells we used two human cell lines to evaluate and compare infectivity and replication to assess whether the production system had an impact. The human cell lines used for evaluation are human lung carcinoma (A549) cells and human muco-epidermoid bronchiolar carcinoma (NCI H292) cells. These cells previously have shown to have different susceptibilities to influenza viruses. A549 cells were used in this study because they support productive viral replication to levels and kinetics similar to the human primary lung cells [13]. NCI H292 cells have been previously shown to be good for isolation and replication of many human viruses including vaccinia virus, HSV, adenovirus, polyoma BK virus and paramyxoviruses [14]. NCI H292 cells have also been suggested as an alternate to primary rhesus monkey kidney cells for isolation and replication of human paramyxoviruses [14]. Viruses that do not replicate in NCI H292 cells include CMV, VZV, SV-40, respiratory coronaviruses and some influenza A and type B viruses. Additionally, A549 and NCI H292 cells have been studied to evaluate influenza virus replication, proinflammatory cytokine responses and influenza virus induced apoptosis [15], [16].",

The test virus used represented egg and cell produced H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B virus represented by A/New Caledonia/20/99, A/Wisconsin/67/05 and B/Malaysia/2506/04 virus, respectively. The three seasonal strains were produced by a classical reassortment process according to the currently licensed LAIV master virus seed (MVS) process. The cell produced virus for the study was generated from the same virus seeds used to manufacture the egg-derived 2006\u20132007 viruses. Briefly, the egg produced virus strains were produced in 10- to 11-day-old SPF eggs inoculated with 0.1 mL of 3.1 log10\n TCID50/mL each. The inoculated eggs were incubated at 33 \u00b1 1 in the presence of 70% humidity for 48 h for H1N1 and H3N2 virus and 60 h for influenza B virus. The virus containing allantoic fluid was harvested, stabilized with sucrose phosphate buffer and further processed for downstream purification. The final purified bulk was tested for virus concentration and stored at or below 60 \u00b0C until further use. The egg produced viruses were subjected to four passages in eggs during the MVS manufacturing process. The MDCK cell produced viruses were propagated in MDCK cells using sufficient quantity of cells for bioreactor inoculation. The cells were allowed to attach to the microcarriers with controlled pH in the presence of CO2. Viral infection of the MDCK cell culture was achieved by allowing the microcarriers to settle and by addition of infection medium and appropriate volume of master virus seed stock. Upon addition of infection medium and virus inoculum the cell culture was maintained at 33 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C for 48 h. At the end of infection the cell culture supernatant was collected and further processed through downstream purification. The final purified bulk was tested for virus concentration and stored at or below 60 \u00b0C until further use.",

In MDCK cells infected at 0.1 MOI, a difference of no more than 0.4 log10\n FFU/mL in virus peak titer was observed between EP and CP A/New Caledonia/20/99, A/Wisconsin/67/05 and B/Malaysia/2503/04 virus (Fig. 1\n).
