            "text": "Mapping the epitope of an antibody on its corresponding antigen is fundamental to our understanding of the mechanisms of molecular recognition and provides the basis for rational vaccine and drug design (Irving et al., 2001). Solving the three-dimensional (3D) structure of an antibody\u2013antigen complex is the most accurate way to determine an epitope. When such a complex is not available (or cannot be obtained), a customary approach is to map the location of the epitope using a phage display library (Barbas et al., 2001). In this technology, peptides that bind the antibody of interest with high affinity are selected from a large pool of random peptides. These affinity-selected peptides are assumed to mimic the genuine epitope in terms of their physicochemical properties and spatial organization. Hence, a resemblance of a selected peptide to a linear region of the antigen is often indicative of the genuine epitope location. However, epitopes are often conformational, being comprised of a number of discontinuous segments of the antigen brought together via folding. Thus, an affinity-selected peptide may have similarity only to non-linear fragments of the antigen. Advanced computational methods are hence needed to correctly infer the epitope from the selected peptides.",

Thus allowing users to run and compare two epitope prediction algorithms that rely on two different methodological approaches via a single web platform. These algorithms were proved successful in predicting discontinuous epitopes based on affinity-selected peptides (Bublil et al., 2006, 2007; Enshell-Seijffers et al., 2003; Mayrose et al., 2007; Tarnovitski et al., 2006). Furthermore, the combined algorithmic option executes both PepSurf and Mapitope and combines their results into a single epitope prediction. Pepitope enables the alignment of short, hypothetical or synthesized, sequences to a 3D structure and is thus not confined to mapping random peptides derived from phage-display experiments. Pepitope also provides a powerful visualization tool to examine the predicted epitopes and each of the peptide-to-structure alignments. It allows non-expert users to predict epitopes with no previous algorithmic knowledge, yet incorporates advanced options for expert users to fine-tune their predictions.",

The main differences between Pepitope and the other servers are described at the \u2018OVERVIEW\u2019 web section. Although some of the features of Pepitope were previously suggested, it is the only tool that uniquely combines all of the following features: (1) It takes into account both identities and similarities, e.g. using the BLOSUM matrix, when aligning linear peptide sequences to the antigen 3D structure. (2) It allows any number of gaps in the alignment and distinguishes between terminal gaps and non-terminal ones. (3) It clusters the resulting matches on the protein surface, thus providing an epitope prediction, which is based on the entire set of peptides collectively. (4) It optionally accounts for the number of times a peptide was selected in the phage-display experiment. A short description of the Pepitope methodology is provided herein, and a more detailed description is available under the \u2018OVERVIEW\u2019, \u2018GALLERY\u2019 and \u2018QUICK HELP\u2019 web sections. The ease of using Pepitope is exemplified by predicting the human monoclonal antibody (mAb) Bo2C11 epitope for coagulation factor VIII (FVIII).",

Bo2C11 was used to screen a combinatorial phage-display library resulting in a set of 27 affinity-selected peptides (Villard et al., 2003). Figure 1 illustrates the main Pepitope output. Pepitope predicts an epitope that significantly overlaps the benchmark epitope. The predicted epitope is comprised of 30 residues, of which 12 are part of the genuine epitope. The 18 remaining predicted residues, although false-positive predictions, are located in close proximity to the genuine epitope and may also contribute to the mAb binding.\n",
