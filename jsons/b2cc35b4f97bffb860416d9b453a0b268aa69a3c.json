Additionally, the dry season of Africa is about to come, the abrupt decrease of daily mean temperature would be conducive to the spread of the disease. Consequently, the COVID-19 would probably outbreak in Africa if no strict prevention and control measures are implemented in these countries. This study aims to simulate and predict the epidemic spread in African countries under different epidemic intervention scenarios through modeling, and to propose a series of epidemic prevention and control measures, which will be crucial in containing the epidemic spread in these countries. The researches are mainly conducted in six African countries of South Africa, Egypt, Algeria, Nigeria, Senegal and Kenya.

These variables in total constitute the whole population. The parameters represent the protection rate (considering the intervention), infection rate, average incubation time, average quarantined time, cure rate, and mortality rate, respectively. With the laps of time, the recovery rate will increase and the mortality rate will decrease, and the adoption of interventions (such as wearing masks) will reduce the exposed significantly. Assuming the incubation period remains unchanged, the diagnosis of all cases depends on the intervention and the average quarantined time, as well as the exposed cases.",

Fortunately, the South Africa and Senegal are in line with this scenario. If the response speed of the governments to take prevention measures is slow and there are loopholes in the intervention measures (such as lower testing rate), the spread of the epidemic may meet the second scenario (mitigation) and the basically control time will be delayed by about 10 days by comparison with the first scenario. The results showed that Algeria, Nigeria and Kenya are adopted the palliative measures, and the curves are accord with this scenario. By comparison, the third scenario (mildness) is the worst, with the outbreak being basically contained in late May, when the number of infections doubled. Presently, the changes of the epidemic spread in Egypt is similar to the third scenario, so it is necessary to timely adjust the strategies to make the curve as close as possible to the second scenario. Besides, the epidemic will be probably uncontrolled without the rapid public health response, along with the poor awareness of the disease, insufficient prevention and control measures, and the lack of self-protection awareness. Although the relevant national departments (such as Egypt) have issued strict prevention and control measures, the containing effects on the spread of the virus are not significant according to the simulation and prediction results. Therefore, stronger, earlier interventions and a sense of public self-protection will be the essential measures to fight this disaster (John et al., 2020) . It should be pointed out that this prediction is a conservative estimate under the condition of the uncertainty of the data (such as low testing rate).",

Considering the is the ratio of exposed period to generation time). In order to reduce rapidly, more aggressive actions of prevention and control measures should be taken urgently for curbing the spread of the disease in these six countries.Taking the strongest epidemic prevention and control in China as a reference, the six countries can basically control outbreaks in late April with , while the number of infected cases may be separately in 2760~3380 (South Africa), 1300~1600 (Egypt), 1640~2100 (Algeria), 270~340 (Nigeria), 300~370 (Senegal), 180~220 (Kenya). However, considering the low social economy level, and the limitation of medical condition, the methods of epidemic prevention and control used in Africa cannot reach that used in China.Therefore, the second intervention scenario (after the MH parameter optimization, the scenario intervention factor ) is slightly better. Forecasting trends indicated that the six countries can basically control outbreaks in early May (compared with the first scenario, basically controlled will delay about 10 days). The number of confirmed cases will probably Senegal), 270~340 (Kenya). The infected cases will be increased by 1.43~1.55 times as that in scenario one, and the medical overstretched will highlight and this is bad for the development of the social economy. Therefore, it is crucial to take effective measures (such as quarantine all cases in an attempt to cut off the source of infection) to put the \"mitigation\" scenario closer to the \"suppression\". The epidemic spread could belong to the third scenario ( ) under the conditions of a lower understanding of the epidemic and the government adopted effective prevention measures lag behind, as well as the public self-protection consciousness is weak, and poor medical conditions (such as lower virus testing efficiency). In this case, the infection cases will exponentially increase, the medical overstretched phenomenon becoming serious, and there will emerge a large number of death cases. The epidemic outbreak will be by and large controlled in late May (about 20 days later than the second scenario), when the number of cases could reach between 8000~10000 (South Africa), 3470~4250 (Egypt), 4850~5950 (Algeria), 825~1010 (Nigeria), 850~1050 (Senegal), 540~670 (Kenya), which will be doubled of that in the second scenario. It can be found that earlier implementation of reasonable interventions will significantly reduce the number of infections. If government interventions does not work, i.e., populations are devoid of self-awareness. Combined with the poor social environment in African countries, epidemic will be a comprehensive \"outbreak\" from the middle to late April. African countries will face more severe social and economic challenges. And it will be unfavorable to realize the",

It is obvious that the severe prevention and control measures are implemented by both South Africa and Senegal, where the spread curves are closer to the first scenario (2760~3380, 300~370). Mitigation measures are implemented in Algeria, Nigeria and Kenya, and the curves correspond to the second scenario (2500~306, 420~520, 270~340). However, the response of prevention and control measures in Egypt lags behind obviously. Therefore, both South Africa and Senegal should continue to maintain and strengthen the current prevention and control measures.

In particular, Egypt must adjust the control strategies and take defensive measures implemented timely to make the curve as close to the second scenario as possible.",
