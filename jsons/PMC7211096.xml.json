For example, immunomodulatory treatments may not be the best option when the mechanism of myocardial injury is stress cardiomyopathy or ACS, unless there is a non-cardiac indication for administration.",

However, this is often restricted by the need to reduce additional exposure and in the setting of non-myocarditis causes of myocardial injury, the diagnostic utility may be low. Given these concerns, advanced imaging with cardiac MRI would be the preferred non-invasive modality for tissue characterisation and can serve as a surrogate for biopsy to differentiate between aetiologies of myocardial injury. Nonetheless, challenges with exposure during patient transport and contamination of the MRI scanner limit widespread adoption.",

To address this constraint, there has been growing interest and several initiatives to use point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for characterising systolic function and strain. The ability to rapidly identify regional wall motion abnormalities provides discriminatory ability to differentiate between the causes of myocardial injury, although it is unlikely to be confirmatory. For example, stress cardiomyopathy may mimic ACS or focal myocarditis on echocardiography.",

Standardised cardiac and inflammatory biomarker testing in combination with POCUS and clinical correlation may provide more accurate phenotyping in many cases while constraining exposure. For example, if CRS is felt to be the leading culprit, then we would anticipate an uptrend in both cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers without regionality in left ventricular dysfunction. Correlation with postmortem pathological examination may confirm accuracy of diagnosis, although autopsies have also been limited by similar concerns of exposure to healthcare workers.",
