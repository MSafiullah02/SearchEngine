            "text": "Lassa virus (LASV) is a single-stranded ambisense RNA virus belonging to the Arenavirus genus in the Arenaviridae family (Radoshitzky et al., 2015). LASV causes an acute hemorrhagic illness in humans\u2014Lassa fever disease (LFD), which is characterized by fever, muscle aches, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, chest, and abdominal pain (Ogbu et al., 2007). However, the mild manifestation of LFD and asymptomatic infection with LASV is common (Frame et al., 1970, Ajayi et al., 2013). The natural host of LASV is the multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis, person-to-person transmission was reported, particularly in nosocomial settings). The role of M. erythroleucus as a natural host of LASV is under discussion. These rodents are ubiquitous and highly commensal in Africa (Keenlyside et al., 1983, Monath et al., 1974). Despite the wide distribution of M. natalensis, LASV is endemic only in West African countries, including Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, Benin, Mali, and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (Frame et al., 1970, Safronetz et al., 2013). Based on estimates, the number of LASV infections ranges from 300,000 to 500,000 cases in endemic areas (Siddle et al., 2018) with a fatality rate of 1%. (Ogbu et al., 2007). Humans primarily become infected with LASV through inhalation or ingestion of infected rodent excreta. In addition, the infection can occur due to handling and preparation of infected M. natalensis for grilling, as they are considered delicious in the West African region (Ter Meulen et al., 1996). Person-to-person transmission was also reported, especially in nosocomial settings (Monath et al., 1973).",

However, this method has a relatively low sensitivity (ranging from 102\u2013105 PFU/ml) (Jahrling et al., 1985). This peculiarity limits its usage, particularly at an early stage of LFD because of the low viral load in the biological fluids of patients. In addition, serological methods based on specific antibody detection in the case of LFD cannot be used during the initial days of the onset of the disease because a considerable concentration of LASV-specific IgM appears during 10\u201320 days (Salvato et al., 2018). However, a lack of an antibody response has been reported in some fatal cases of Lassa fever (Wulff and Johnson, 1979). Moreover, differing antibody responses depending on the virus strain used (Emmerich et al., 2008). Therefore, RT-qPCR technique is most suitable for the diagnosis of LASV (Salvato et al., 2018), particularly during the initial days after LFD onset and is the preferred method for the rapid and early diagnosis of Lassa fever because of its high sensitivity and easy implementation (Gunther and Lenz, 2004). In this paradigm, a number of RT-PCR assays for LASV detection were developed and evaluated. Most of them targeted the S-segment encoding the glycoprotein precursor and nucleoprotein as limited information is available regarding LASV sequences (Drosten et al., 2002, Trappier et al., 1993, Demby et al., 1994, Trombley et al., 2010). However, some LASV strains were not detected using the developed RT-PCRs (Trappier et al., 1993). From the new information regarding the sequences of the S-segment, LASV is a virus of high genetic variability and designing reliable LASV-specific primers and probes is problematic (Bowen et al., 2000). The appearance of a sufficient number of the L-gene sequences facilitated in designing an assay that could be more reliable for LASV detection because RNA polymerases that are encoded by the L-gene share conserved amino acid motifs even between different virus families (Poch et al., 1990, Poch et al., 1989). During the past 10 years, several LASV genomes have been completely sequenced, and the L-gene sequences of LASV also demonstrate high genetic variability even within one genetic lineage. Therefore, the genetic diversity of LASV is a natural peculiarity, which most likely will be a limitation in the usage of RT-qPCR in the diagnosis of LASV.",
