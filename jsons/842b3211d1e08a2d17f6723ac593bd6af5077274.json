            "text": "The Wheezing Illnesses Study Leidsche Rijn (WHISTLER) was initiated in December 2001 as a single-centre prospective birth cohort study and will include a population-based sample of at least 2000 healthy newborns. The aims of WHISTLER are to investigate determinants for wheezing illnesses (including neonatal lung function, viral infections, asthma-susceptibility genes and endotoxin exposure) and to derive a comprehensive risk score, that is appropriate for use in primary health care and allows for efficient planning of early preventive strategies. Baseline examination includes a questionnaire evaluating known risk factors for wheezing illnesses; anthropometric measurements; measurements of infant and parental lung function; and sampling of infant and parental DNA. Participants will be followed for respiratory events using data from a daily respiratory symptom questionnaire; visits to the general practitioner (primary health care visits, drugs prescriptions and hospital referral); viral sampling during wheezing episodes; and house dust sampling. Based on actual neonatal care practice and embedded in a larger epidemiological study, the Utrecht Health Project, WHISTLER will provide an unique framework to address issues in childhood respiratory disease that are currently insufficiently understood. In particular, WHISTLER will provide a well-balanced view on the prognostic power of neonatal lung function and genetic and environmental factors (including viral infections and endotoxin exposure) to predict wheezing illnesses from birth to young adulthood and beyond. In the scope of prevention, WHISTLER is expected to support the design of solid based prevention measures to reduce respiratory morbidity, mortality and associated costs, and to improve quality of life.",

            "text": "Wheezing illnesses are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in infancy and childhood and have a large impact on health care [1, 2] . The prevalence has increased substantially over the last few decades [3, 4] . Of equal importance is the growing evidence for a link between childhood wheezing illnesses and chronic respiratory disease in adult life [5, 6] . For effective targeting of prevention strategies more insight in risk factors for different wheezing phenotypes is necessary [7] . Moreover, such strategies should probably be implemented as early in life as possible. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, studies specifically aiming at the identification of the highrisk infant in primary care at a very early age are not available. The Wheezing Illnesses Study Leidsche Rijn (WHISTLER) is designed firstly, to investigate determinants of different wheezing phenotypes and secondly, to derive a comprehensive risk score for wheezing illnesses, that is appropriate for use in pri-mary health care and allows for efficient planning of early preventive strategies. This paper describes the rationale and design of WHISTLER.",

Recent data on British pre-school children show that 29% of all children have a history of ever wheezing, 26% are current wheezers, 19% have been diagnosed to have asthma and 26% are treated for wheeze [3] . The rising prevalence around the world imposes a growing burden on society in terms of consultations in primary care, hospital admissions, associated health care costs and quality of life of affected children and their families [2, 8] . It is estimated that preschool wheeze in the UK costs the health service a total of 53 million UK pounds. The largest expenditure, 34 million UK pounds, is for primary care, followed by prescriptions costs representing 11 million UK pounds [2] . In addition, wheezing illnesses in early childhood predispose to chronic respiratory disease in later life, which requires long-term care with additional financial and social impact [5, 6, 9] .",

Foetal growth, male gender, neonatal lung function, maternal age, breastfeeding, family history of asthma or atopy, day care attendance, number of siblings, tobacco smoke exposure, air pollution, socio-economic status and pet keeping are associated with wheezing illnesses [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Unfortunately, easily applicable scores to reliably estimate the risk to develop wheezing illnesses in healthy newborns are not available [21] . Such risk scores are a prerequisite to target prevention measures and early interventions. More general measures such as avoidance of tobacco smoke and allergen exposure are already advocated in very young children [22] [23] [24] . However, many other preventive actions require more individually tailored risk estimations. WHISTLER will combine the prognostic value of different risk factors for wheezing illnesses and aim at developing a prediction rule. This model should be an easy applicable algorithm that will support the physician to detect high risk children in daily practice. Apart from established risk factors, WHISTLER will pay specific attention to other putative determinants, such as impaired neonatal lung function, asthma-susceptibility genes, viral infections and endotoxin exposure.",

            "text": "There is ample evidence that a relatively small airway calibre contributes to the risk of wheezing illnesses [14, 25] . Impaired foetal or neonatal lung growth might lead to smaller airway calibre and consequently to an increased risk for wheezing during viral infections or asthmatic inflammation. Only a few small prospective cohort studies investigated premorbid lung function in association with subsequent respiratory illnesses [14, [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, because neonatal lung function testing is technically difficult and often requires sedation, sufficient sample size is difficult to obtain and results are conflicting. Some authors found a relationship between lung function and subsequent wheezing [14, 25, 26] , while others did not [27, 28] . Non-invasive techniques for neonatal lung function measurement have recently been developed to assess compliance and resistance of the respiratory system under normal breathing conditions. These techniques rely on the relaxation of respiratory musculature after a brief airway occlusion during expiration (Hering-Breuer reflex) and primarily reflect the mechanical properties of the lung and airways [29] [30] [31] . These techniques are rapid and simple to perform by experienced staff during the baby's natural sleep. International guidelines are available to ensure safety, precision and reproducibility [32, 33] . WHISTLER aims to elucidate the relation between neonatal lung function and subsequent wheezing illnesses in a large populationbased cohort using this relatively new technique. Notably, measurement of passive airway mechanics seems particularly suitable for predictive purposes in a general population of newborns. WHISTLER will investigate the possibility to use neonatal lung function as an additional predictive parameter for wheezing illnesses in routine daily practice.",

Different genomic regions that contain so-called ''atopy/asthma genes'' have been identified. Identification of susceptibility genes in these regions and knowledge about gene-gene and gene-environment interactions will increase our understanding of the genetic basis of wheezing and asthma, which may be crucial for the development of primary prevention strategies. The role of viral infections in the inception of asthma remains controversial. Early exposure to certain viral respiratory infections (e.g., hepatitis A) may protect against wheezing illnesses, whereas some other infections (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus) may exert the opposite effect [35, 36] . The relation between neonatal lung function, wheezing and specific viral infections is not known. In addition, the exposure to endotoxin and other bacterial wall components, found in many indoor and outdoor environments, is important to investigate. This may play a role in the development of tolerance to allergens found in natural environments and consequently in the development of atopic diseases [37] .",

A birth rate of 100/2500 inhabitants/year will lead to an expected 400 births in 2004 and at least similar numbers over the next years. In the future there will be seven primary health care centres, each eventually serving 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants. Each centre will have approximately five general practitioners with supporting staff and a pharmacist. Every two centres will have their own well-baby health care facility, an obstetric practice and a first aid service. This infrastructure provides an excellent basis for epidemiological research. In 2000, a large health monitoring study was initiated in Leidsche Rijn, the Utrecht Health Project (Dutch acronym LRGP: Leidsche Rijn Gezondheids Project, www.lrgp.nl). This study aims to generate valuable data from all inhabitants on determinants of health and disease and on the use and efficiency of innovative healthcare. Inhabitants are invited to participate in the study when they register with their new general practitioner. Written informed consent is obtained from all participants. During an extended first consultation an ''Individual Health Profile'' (IHP) is compiled that provides an update on the health status of the participant and contains information that is relevant for the physician as well as for research purposes. This IHP comprises the following components: an update on medical history and pharmacotherapy; questionnaires on socio-economic status, mental health, cardiovascular risk, trauma, dietary intake, life-style factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol) and housing; and biometry (age, gender, weight, length, blood pressure, blood sample for total cholesterol, HDL/LDL cholesterol and glucose, 12-lead electrocardiogram and pulmonary function). Medical history as well as follow-up (including drug prescriptions, additional examinations and referral to other primary care staff or to secondary care) is registered in the patient's electronic database (Medicom \u00d2 , PharmaPartners, the Netherlands) by the general practitioners during routine health care using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) [38] .

Measurements are performed during natural sleep without use of any sedation and with the infant in supine position. The resistance (R rs ), compliance (C rs ) and time constant (t rs ) of the total respiratory system are measured using the single breath occlusion technique (SBT). Briefly, end-inspi-ratory airway occlusion induces a Hering-Breuer reflex with complete relaxation of respiratory muscles and passive expiration after release of the occlusion. During periods of no flow, rapid pressure equilibration can be reached. The pressure at airway opening (P ao ) represents the elastic recoil pressure of the respiratory system and can be related to changes in volume and flow in order to calculate the compliance and resistance of the respiratory system. The slope of the descending portion of the passive flow-volume loop represents the expiratory time constant of the respiratory system [30, 31] . Flow is measured using a heated Lilly-type pneumotachimeter (series 8300, linear range 0-10 l/min; Hans Rudolph Inc., Kansas City, MO, USA) attached to a face mask sealed with silicone putty (Magic Putty, medium, Oldelft Benelux BV, Delft, The Netherlands) to prevent air leaks and to minimize dead space (Figure 2 ). Volume is obtained as the electronic integration of flow. Pressure inside the facemask is measured with a pressure transducer (Honeywell, type 163PC01D75, Morristown, NJ). Flow, volume and pressure at the infants' mouth are recorded and presented on a monitor. Brief occlusions are performed manually close to maximal inspiration. The occluded airway opening is released when a plateau in mouth pressure is reached. Measurements are done according to the guidelines of the European Respiratory Society with a smooth expiration within 10% of the previous expiration and without evidence of glottic closure, braking or active expiratory effort, duration of a pressure plateau P100 ms and variability <10 Pa and linearity of the descending part of the passive flow-volume loop over at least 40% of expiration with r 2 > 0.99 [33] . At least three technically acceptable flow-volume curves are required to calculate mean resistance, compliance and time constant. Lung function measurements are performed by WHISTLER staff. Elaborate interrater reliability studies are performed as part of WHISTLER.",

Given a non-response of around 25%, this number will be achieved in 6-8 study years. The association between lung function parameters and wheezing illness will be analysed using logistic regression techniques. An estimated 20-30% of children will attract some form of (first) wheezing illness that requires medical attention of a general practitioner [3] . This will enable multivariate prognostic modelling with many variables. All available prognostic variables will first be univariately evaluated with respect to outcome (wheezing illnesses or not). Subsequently, a multivariate model will be constructed from all univariately relevant variables except lung function. Internal validity of models will be evaluated using bootstrapping methods. The additional predictive capacity of lung function parameters will be evaluated by adding these to the first model. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves of different models will be compared (Hosmer-Lemeshow). These procedures will be repeated within certain risk groups of children.",
