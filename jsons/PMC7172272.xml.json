(2000) reported almost complete sequence of segment 2 and partial sequence of segment 1 by cloning and sequencing and divided human PBVs into two genogroups (genogroups I and II) based on the sequence of segment 2 that encodes for RdRp. For the specific detection and typing of PBV, they designed primer pair Pico B25 and Pico B43 for genogroup I and primer pair Pico B23 and Pico B24 for genogroup II. Viruses that do not belong to either genogroup I or II are called genogroup non-I, non-II (Ganesh et al., 2012a, Ganesh et al., 2012b). Subsequently, Fregolente and Gatti (2009) proposed a standard nomenclature to assign a clear and unique name to each strain of PBV. According to their recommendation, the strain name starts with identification of genogroup (GI, GII, non-GI or non-GII) followed by PBV, common name of host species, three letter country code, strain name, and year of isolation.",

In animals, the role of PBV has been studied primarily in swine and most recently in chickens and turkeys. In a Venezuelan study, 27 of 244 (11.1%) samples from swine gastroenteritis cases were positive for PBV (Ludert et al., 1991). In Brazil, PBV was detected in 15.3% of pigs with diarrhea and 9.6% of pigs without diarrhea (Gatti et al., 1989).",

Recently, distinctive sequences of PBVs were identified by metagenomic analysis in a pooled intestinal sample collected from enteritis-affected turkeys in North Carolina (Day et al., 2010). On the basis of RdRp gene sequences of turkey PBVs, only 49.5\u201370.0% nucleotide identity was reported with PBV strains from humans, pigs, dogs, rats and snakes. Additional characterization by RdRp gene sequences revealed that turkey PBV had 62.0% nucleotide identity with PBV of greater Rhea (Rhea Americana) (Day and Zsak, 2014). Although complete genome sequences of human, lapine and bovine PBVs have been reported, there is no report on complete genome characterization of PBV in birds.",

            "text": "Viral enteritis in domestic poultry places an economic burden on poultry producers worldwide. Recently, two new syndromes have been described in Minnesota turkeys namely, the \u2018poult enteritis syndrome\u2019 (PES) and \u2018light turkey syndrome\u2019 (LTS). The PES is an intestinal disease of young turkeys between 1 day and 7 weeks of age and is characterized by diarrhea, depression, and lethargy with pale intestines and/or excessively fluid cecal contents (Jindal et al., 2010). The LTS is characterized by lower weight of market age turkeys as compared to their standard breed character. It is believed that PES at a young age sets up conditions for the development of LTS later. Three enteric viruses (astro-, rota- and reoviruses) have been shown to cause concomitant infections in LTS and PES flocks in Minnesota (Jindal et al., 2010, Mor et al., 2013). The same three viruses have also been found in apparently healthy turkey flocks. The PES and LTS are considered a part of the poult enteritis complex (PEC). Recently, we tested a pool of fecal samples collected from LTS turkeys by NextGen Illumina sequencing and found the evidence of PBV sequences. The present study was undertaken to analyze the complete genome of turkey PBV and determine the prevalence of PBVs in Minnesota turkeys.",

The PES-affected birds continue to be uneven in size and may develop LTS at marketing age. In this study, we found high prevalence of PBVs at 2\u20133 weeks of age in LTS flocks (as compared to non-LTS flocks), which indicates possible involvement of PBVs in LTS. This is well known that as the age advances, poults become more resistant to enteric virus infections; hence, high incidence of PBV at 5 weeks of age in non-LTS flocks may not affect the growth of the birds. Future experimental studies with PBVs are indicated to determine their impact on LTS in poults.",

Phylogenetic analysis of 15 sequences based on RdRp gene divided them into four subgroups (IA to ID) under genogroup I. An interesting finding was that the previously reported turkey PBVs from cases of PEC in North Carolina formed different subgroups (IE and IF) indicating that there may be geographical differences in turkey PBV strains in the USA. The divergence observed in our sequences is in correlation with previous findings in chicken and turkey PBVs (Day and Zsak, 2014, Silva et al., 2014). Day and Zsak (2014) reported that turkey PBVs were distinctly related to genogroup I. However, in this study we observed that only subgroups IC and ID were distinctly related to genogroup I and all other chicken and turkey PBVs are related to PBVs from different species. This indicates that sequencing of additional chicken and turkey PBV sequences is necessary to obtain a better comparison of PBVs from chickens and turkeys.",

In this study, we did see some sequences with dual peaks but did not pursue this work further to determine the types of variants present in a single sample. Similar to Day and Zsak (2014), who developed an RT-PCR of amplicon size \u223c1100 bp, we developed RdRp primers with a product size of 995 bp. Due to high variations among PBVs, the large sequence size will be helpful to make better comparison among PBV variants. We detected insertions and deletions along with nucleotide substitutions in RdRp region of the virus; however, significance of these findings is not yet clear. This may possibly be the reason for low typing rate using capsid gene primers in the present study.",
