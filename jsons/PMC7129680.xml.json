The median number of days with each individual symptom was reported owing to the nonnormal distribution of this information. The total number of days with symptoms was calculated by summing the maximum number of days reported with the most prevalent symptom in each week. Thus, the maximum possible total number of symptom days was 56. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the treatment and placebo groups for each of the 8 symptoms and the total symptom days. We also compared the 2 groups each week separately for persons reporting symptoms of any kind vs no symptoms at all. \u03c72 or Fisher exact tests were used to compare these data.",
