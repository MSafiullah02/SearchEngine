NC of hantavirus was shown to have a critical role in directly mediating viral translation initiation via two ways: (1) The NC interacts with the 43S preinitiation complex and replaces eIF4G (which links the mRNA cap with the 43S preinitiation complex) and eIF4A (a helicase necessary for translation initiation) to facilitate the loading of ribosomes onto capped mRNA and ensure the efficient translation of viral mRNA,24 and (2) the NC specifically interacts with ribosomal protein 19 (a structural component of the 40S subunit), which causes the host translation machinery to preferentially bind to the viral transcripts by facilitating ribosome loading on capped viral mRNAs owing to the higher affinity of the NC to bind to ribosomal protein S19.25, 26 The cellular protein eEF1A interacts with the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication complex by binding to the NC and consequently facilitates gRNA synthesis and viral production.27 An eEF1A plays a similar role in tobacco mosaic virus28, 29 and tomato bushy stunt virus30, 31 via interaction with the NCs. Another example of NC association with cellular protein is that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) NC binds to Tat and significantly reduces the level of Tat but not mRNA expression via the proteasomal pathway, which results in the decrease of transcriptional activation at the late stage of the viral infection cycle.32 Furthermore, both poly [ADP\u2013ribose] polymerase 1 and poly (A)\u2010binding protein (a host cellular protein that enhances translational efficiency) play an important role in the Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) life cycle via their interaction with the NC; the former increases the propagation of PRRSV, and the latter enhances viral replication.33, 34\n",

In a previous study, the transcription of coronavirus gRNA was regulated by the template switching to generate shorter, longer subgenomic (sg) mRNAs and gRNAs through a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism36 (Figure 2(a)). The phosphorylation of NC\u2010regulated glycogen synthase kinase\u20103 (GSK3) is required for the template to switch from discontinuous to continuous transcription, and NC\u2013GSK3 interaction is the base of the direct phosphorylation effect of GSK3 on NCs. Furthermore, phosphorylated NCs can recruit the RNA helicase DEAD (Asp\u2010Glu\u2010Ala\u2010Asp) box helicase 1 (DDX1) to the phosphorylated NC\u2010containing complex through directly interaction with DDX1,9 which is critical for the production of longer several subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) and gRNAs.36 Therefore, GSK3 inhibition, DDX1 knockdown, or helicase activity substitution reduces the production of longer sgmRNAs and gRNAs but not short sgmRNAs.36 As a result, viral RNA synthesis and replication were also decreased, suggesting that NC phosphorylation mediated by GSK3 plays an important role in regulating the viral life cycle.8\n",

The core protein of HCV also affects the viral life cycle by interacting with various cellular proteins. Previous studies have shown that the association of the core protein of HCV with AP2M1 is essential for viral assembly but not for HCV RNA replication. The phosphorylation of AP2M1 by the serine/threonine kinases AAK137 and GAK38, 39increases the binding of core protein to AP2M1; conversely, dephosphorylation of AP2M1 by PP2A40 impaired its interaction with core protein and HCV assembly. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of core protein\u2010AP2M1 interaction was shown to negatively regulate HCV assembly41 (Figure 2(c)). In addition, triglyceride\u2010synthesizing enzyme acyl CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 can recruit core protein to lipid droplets to facilitate the interaction between core and NS5A proteins42 (Figure 2(c)). Core protein was also found to interact with mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase\u2010activated protein kinase 3 (MAPKAPK3), a serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated by stress. HCV infection can increase MAPKAPK3 expression at both the RNA and protein levels. Knockdown of MAPKAPK3 resulted in a reduction of viral proteins and HCV propagation but not HCV RNA levels. MAPKAPK3 increased HCV IRES\u2010mediated translation, and this activity was further increased by core protein, suggesting that HCV core protein facilitates its own propagation by modulating MAPKAPK343 (Figure 2(c)).",

Another study showed that M protein is necessary and sufficient for Newcastle disease virus VLP budding (Figure 2(d)). Furthermore, that group suggested that M\u2013NC interactions are responsible for the incorporation of the NC into VLPs and that F protein is incorporated indirectly owing to interactions with NC and HN protein.45 Similarly, in Mopeia virus, the incorporation of the NC into viral VLPs is highly selective39, 46 and induced by matrix Z protein; the same is true for Nipah virus47, 48 and HPIV1.49\n",

By destroying the PKR antiviral response, the NC of ANDV ensures the continuous synthesis of viral proteins required for efficient viral replication and survival in infected hosts77 (Figure 3). Other studies showed that the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus NC binds to the kinase domain of I\u03baB kinase\u2010related kinase (IKK\u03b5) to block IKK\u03b5 autocatalytic activity and the ability to phosphorylate IRF3, and the NC\u2010IKK\u03b5 interaction plays a crucial role in arenavirus\u2010host interaction.77 With the exception of Tacaribe virus, all the NCs of arenaviruses from both Old World and New World antigenic groups disrupt innate antiviral defense by inhibiting the activation of IRF\u20103 as well as the nuclear translocation of IRF\u20103,78 and several residues spanning residues 382\u2013386 of the NC of prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus have been found to contribute to the inhibition of type I IFN production.79 For Lassa virus, an Old World arenavirus, a conserved DEDDH RNase domain within the NC is involved in type IFN suppression, thus allowing the establishment of a productive early viral infection and possibly contributing to the process of viral RNA replication.80 All the catalytic mutants D389A, E391A, D466A, D533A, and H528A showed a complete loss function of suppressing IFN.81, 82, 83 Furthermore, natural killer (NK) cells are strongly activated, and antigen\u2010presenting cell\u2010mediated NK cell responses were also significantly increased as evidenced by the responses of NK cells to dendritic cells and macrophages when infected by recombinant Lassa virus with mutations at residues D389A in the NC.84 The NC of borna disease virus, a nonsegmented, negative\u2010stranded RNA virus, inhibits IFN induction by preventing the nuclear localization of IRF785 (Figure 3).
