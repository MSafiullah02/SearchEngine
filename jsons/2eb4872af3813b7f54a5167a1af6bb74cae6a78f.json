For example, given the sacredness of cows in India, some Hindus are drinking cow urine to prevent COVID-19, a practice backed by government officials [4] . In Iran, social media accounts circulated false stories of curing COVID-19 by drinking high-proof alcohol, poisoning over 2,000 people due to the inadvertent consumption of methanol with bleach to hide its color [5] . The quick spread of misinformation regarding nonevidence-based treatments for COVID-19 may be due to feelings of fear, helplessness, and hope. Because there is no definitive treatment for COVID-19, people J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f seek remedies based on their level of knowledge and personal or popular beliefs, which is detrimental to both their own health and the public's health.",

Even though chloroquine derivates are not approved treatments for COVID-19, President Trump has tweeted and publicly suggested the therapeutic benefit of the drugs. Due to the media attention surrounding chloroquine, an Arizona man died after ingesting chloroquine phosphate (an additive to household products meant to treat fish parasites) in an effort to prevent himself from getting infected with coronavirus. [8] . In Madagascar, President Andry Rojoelina launched an herbal coronavirus \"cure\" produced from the artemisia plant, yet the WHO stated that the tonic is not evidence-based and is potentially toxic [9] . Touting unproven COVID-19 treatments will only worsen the current healthcare crisis, as people will certainly experiment with these remedies. As a result, health care systems will become overwhelmed with many critically ill patients, from both COVID-19 and those with toxicity from nonevidence-based treatments.",

Use of Chinese herbal products for treating viruses is not guided by viral pathology, rather herbs are prescribed by herbalists according to Chinese diagnostic patterns (inspection, listening, smelling, inquiry, and palpitation) [12, 13] . The implications of medicating with herbal-based formulas is serious and dangerous because there is no scientific evidence suggesting that these alternative remedies can prevent or cure COVID-19. There are several adverse effects noted with herbal medications, such as hepatotoxicity, and there have been numerous reports of toxic contaminants, including pesticides and heavy metals [14] . Furthermore, although supplementing with vitamins and minerals may improve immune function, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of any supplement will prevent or cure COVID-19. Similarly, \"cures\" spread by Iranian social media accounts (which include gargling vinegar and rosewater or salt, and drinking concoctions of mint or white willow with saffron, turmeric, and cinnamon) are not evidence-based, though they may have other nutritional benefits [15] . Medicating with these herbal formulas or supplements may lead to adverse health effects due to imprecise dosing of the supplement or herb, inherent toxicity of the herb itself, or toxicity of the contaminants in the product, thus complicating the clinical picture.",

Such treatments include nucleotide analogs (remdesivir), anti-malarial drugs (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), protease inhibitors (lopinavir/ritonavir), interferon-, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists [1, 2, 3]. The unprecedented circumstances surrounding this pandemic does not discard the responsibility of respecting medical ethics, ensuring that medical information is accurate, and the published data meets expected scientific standards. Clinical trials testing the efficacy of single and combination treatments are needed to make clear recommendations for treating COVID-19. To date, there are no evidence-based treatments for COVID-19.",
