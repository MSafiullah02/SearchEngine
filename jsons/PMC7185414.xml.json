As the number of infected patients increased, more drastic measures were instituted\n12\n, \n13\n, \n14\n. These included closure of schools, travel advisories to SARS\u2010affected areas, Home Quarantine Orders to persons exposed to SARS patients or returning from SARS\u2010affected areas and increased education on good social behaviour (e.g. to avoid spitting in public). Violations of these laws were punishable by fines and/or jail terms. By 31 May 2003, SARS had infected 206 people in Singapore, with slightly more than half of those infected being health\u2010care workers or hospital inpatients\n15\n. In order to control the transmission of SARS from patient to health worker, the Ministry of Health enforced strict hospital infection control protocols to help break the chain of transmission\n16\n. These measures included compulsory SARS screening for all patients, relatives and visitors. This involved temperature checks both at the main entrances and at entrances to all departments, compulsory filling in of a SARS exposure risk questionnaire, compulsory use of personnel protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, gown, goggles and N\u201095 mask by health\u2010care workers, and wearing of mask and gown by patients (Fig. 1). The hospital also implemented a \u2018no visitor\u2019 rule (with a limit of one visitor if there were compassionate grounds), restricted physical access into hospitals, and implementation of a 1 week on, 1 week off team approach for all staff, that is, radiotherapy centre staff were divided into two groups with each alternating group working every other week. At the National University Hospital (NUH) Radiotherapy Centre, these measures were strictly enforced.",

In multiethnic Singapore, cultural and subcultural influence is strong, thus achieving patient satisfaction is challenging. This is made more difficult with inherent problems of communication because of language barriers between doctor and patient, and non\u2010disclosure at the family's request. With the outbreak of SARS, implementation of infection control measures were strictly enforced and education about the need for such measures was communicated through the media. Despite such efforts, confidence in these measures was still low, with more than half of patients surveyed believing that contraction of SARS was still possible despite preventive measures.

One example was that in order to minimize patient contact, greeting patients with a handshake was discouraged. Another example is mask wearing, which is uncomfortable, and in Singapore made worse because of hot weather and high humidity. However, patients were, overall, satisfied in wearing their mask and seeing their doctors wearing a mask.

Often in Asian societies, where decision\u2010making primarily lies with the family, older patients are not told of their diagnosis or prognosis\n28\n. There is a perception that if the diagnosis is revealed to the patient they might have difficulty dealing with the knowledge that they have cancer. Thus, in Singapore, the non\u2010disclosure rate is high (17% overall for our patients but 24% for patients aged 66\u201380 years old and 72% for patients over 80 years old\n29\n). The lack of knowledge by the elderly patient because of non\u2010disclosure may affect doctor\u2013patient satisfaction, as the elderly patient is not involved in the overall decision\u2010making process. They do not see a need for treatment and thus do not understand the rationale for treatment. Of interest was the fact that in our study, patient age only significantly influenced items within the \u2018interpersonal skills\u2019 domain of the questionnaire. This included questions on whether the patient thought enough information had been provided, whether sufficient opportunity had been given to ask questions and how friendly the doctor was.",

It is possible that radiation oncologists spend more time counseling breast cancer patients about this aspect compared to other cancer patients, and would be an interesting area for future research.",

First, it should be noted that patients in Singapore, a society with strict societal obedience and reluctance to question authority, might not be representative of patients in other non\u2010Chinese cultures. This would be a very interesting area for future research. Second, as infection control measures will undoubtedly vary depending on the type of infection, the applicability to other disease outbreaks is unknown. As far as we are aware, this is the only evaluation of patient satisfaction in an oncology setting during an infectious disease outbreak. Third, we used the only doctor\u2013patient interaction satisfaction instrument validated for oncology outpatient visits. Although this instrument was developed for Western patients, it has not been specifically validated in Singapore (for either English or Chinese versions). Singapore is unique as it is a very westernized society with English as its working language; however, some elderly patients are not as competent in English. Our Chinese version of the instrument was professionally translated, assessed by our department's Chinese\u2010speaking staff, and cancer and non\u2010cancer patients, to ensure the accuracy, comprehension and face validity. Supporting Chinese instrument validity was the finding that instrument language was not associated with patient satisfaction on multivariate analysis. In addition, the original instrument was validated in an area of Canada \u2018rich in cultural diversity\u2019, including a large Chinese population\n23\n.",

First, it is apparent that despite dissatisfaction with individual aspects of the doctor\u2013patient interaction, patients were satisfied overall. This was pleasing given the very strict infection control measures that were implemented. It is possible that awareness of the SARS outbreak, and of hospital precautions, might have prepared patients for any impact on doctor\u2013patient interaction. Our multivariate analysis supports this hypothesis: the strongest predictor for satisfaction was a positive perception of SARS precautions. This may support costly public education media campaigns in the future to emphasize the need.",

It is apparent that the \u2018empathy\u2019 domain, which had the lowest overall satisfaction for our patients, could be specifically targeted; in particular, doctors could be educated to show greater interest in patients despite infection control processes. In other domains, doctors could give patients more support for how to care for their condition and try to use more lay terms, particularly where masks already impair effective communication. It appears that older patients and non\u2010breast cancer patients need particular attention in our patient population. It would be interesting to confirm our findings in other cultures, and to investigate why these patient subgroups might be less satisfied. Further research is also indicated to investigate whether targeted interventions can increase satisfaction, and whether the lifting of infection control measures has any impact (positive or negative) on patient satisfaction with doctor\u2013patient interaction.",
