            "text": "It is a complete check up of the ECMO: plugs, fluid connectors, alarms, the integrity of the whole circuit:\nThe position of the device: The ECMO cart should be placed on brake position, with the controller facing the entrance of the patient\u2019s room. It allows any caregiver to have a visual on the parameters immediately as he enters the room.\nPower supply: Check that the ECMO is correctly plugged, if possible, to a secure plug (a red power outlet). Every ECMO device, whatever the brand, has a power and a battery light on the controller; make sure the battery light is off and the power light is on.On some device, there is an additional on/off switch next to the plug itself.Finally, make sure the power supply alarm is switched on which alerts you in case of an accidental unplugging or an electrical dysfunction.\nFluid connections: Fluids (air and oxygen) are connected to a blender which ensures gas exchanges. This blender is then connected to the oxygenator of the ECMO via a simple tubing. Check the absence of kinks, tensions, and the right connection of the fluid tubing to the oxygenator and gas hoses.\nThe cannulas and tubing:For the ECMO to run properly, there must be no kinks on the full length of your cannulas. The sutures of the cannulas have to be in place. The presence of tie-bands in the appropriate places and the safety of all connectors should be checked. The entire circuit (tubing and oxygenator) must be inspected with a flashlight, looking for clots and/or fibrin , and more specifically the connectors, pigtails, or stopcocks that may be on the circuit. Every center has its own tubing configuration, from a simple loop getting in and out the patient through the pump and the oxygenator, to more complex circuits with bridges, multiple pigtails, stopcocks to allow monitoring pressures, use as IV access to infuse volume or medication. The more connections that are present on the circuit, the more stagnation of blood is created. It enhances the risk of clot formation. That is why complex circuits must be watched with much more caution.The ECMO (VV or VA) allows blood oxygenation. Hence, there is a color difference between cannulas: the admission cannula is dark red, deoxygenated blood, and the reinfusion cannula (starting after the oxygenator) is light red, oxygenated blood. The nurse should check this color difference between the cannulas (Fig. 5.1).\n\n\nThe circulatory parameters of the pump: Circulatory support is the essence of the ECMO, to ensure a correct support or replacement of the cardiac function for VA ECMO or to ensure an adequate gas exchange for VV ECMO.The pump being nonocclusive, the flow rate must always be above 2 L/min. Under that flow rate, there is a risk of backflow, leading to an inefficient ECMO run.The ECMO flow depends on a few parameters:The preload: determined by volemia, venous tone, the position, and the size and length of the admission cannula.The afterload: determined by vascular resistance, the position, size and length of the reinfusion cannula, and the length of the tubing between the pump and the oxygenator.Cannulae sizes: 17\u201319 Fr for reinfusion cannuale, 21\u201323 Fr for admission cannulae, and 5 Fr for the reperfusion line for PVA ECMO.\n\n",

            "text": "The parameters are the rotations per minute (RPM) and the blood flow. The therapeutical goal set by the team is the blood flow. For the nurse, writing down these two parameters has no relevance. The correlation of the RPM and blood flow and its evolution through time will allow an effective management of the ECMO run. For example, at 2 pm, the RPM is set up at 4500 L/min for a blood flow at 4 L/min. At 5 pm, for a similar RPM, the blood flow went down to 2.5 L/min. It can be a sign of hypovolemia maybe due to blood loss or the patient may have moved and kinked partially part of the tubing.\nThe setting of the gas blender: The blender ensures gas exchanges through the oxygenator\u2013\u2013oxygen supply is adjusted via the FiO2 and the CO2 removal via the gas flow. It is essential to write down at each round the gas blender settings. In addition to patient\u2019s saturation, ventilator\u2019s settings, and blood gases results, it enables a timely decision-making.\nThe alarms: They must be set regarding the therapeutic goal. The pump being nonocclusive, it is recommended to maintain the blood flow above 2 L/min to avoid any backflow.It is also crucial to know on which mode your ECMO is working.In a free mode, when an alarm is activated, the ECMO will keep working, but when the ECMO is on intervention mode, as soon as an alarm is set on, the ECMO stops working, and an immediate action must be set to resolve the problem. The choice of the mode depends on the human resources; if a nurse, ECMO specialist, or a perfusionist is constantly present at the patient\u2019s bedside, the intervention mode is possible, but if a nurse is taking care of more than one ECMO patients and cannot intervene immediately when the pump stops, the free mode will be safer.\nThe emergency kit: It should be available at the bedside or in the unit, allowing an immediate response to any adverse events\u2013\u2013clamps, emergency hand crank, emergency supplies (appropriate-sized connectors/shears/tubing/rapid access line, fluid, tie-gun and tie-straps/sterile gloves, preprimed pump, etc.)\n",

            "text": "\n\nThe Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) area: Bleedings in this area are almost unavoidable. Mouth care is then difficult, and sometimes ineffective. With a nose bleed, the nurse can start by digitally pressuring the nostrils for a 5-min period. If the bleeding persists, insert a resorbable hemostatic wick in each nostril. If this technique fails too, the last resort is to insert a nasal compression probe (it is possible to use a urinary catheter). By inflating the balloon of the probe, a compression is made in the posterior fossa, stopping the bleeding.For the mouth, oral care stays crucial even if it seems ineffective. The mouth of the patient should still be gently suctioned to remove drooling, blood, and clots, and cleaned with smooth mouth sticks but only with water. Mouthwashes usually contain alcohol, which can maintain the bleeding and provoke a burning sensation to the patient. In the most severe bleedings, ENT specialist can perform a packing of the mouth: the entire oral cavity and throat will be then packed with hemostatic wicks. Oral care is then impossible, but to avoid pressure ulcer on the palate and tongue, the \u201cpacking\u201d must be humidified with saline every 4\u20136 h and completely removed after 48 h.\nThe dressings: Bleedings can occur on all the patient\u2019s dressing, insertion point of IV lines, suction drains, and ECMO insertion point. The use of hemostatic dressings can avoid redoing the dressings several times a day.\nThe neurological status of the patient: Look for any signs of intracranial hemorrhage\u2013\u2013bilateral pupillary response, level of consciousness, patient\u2019s reaction to the decrease of sedatives [4].\nThe aspect of the lung secretions: Intra-alveolar hemorrhage can occur. Bleeds can be related to the disease itself, especially for patients on VV ECMO with severe ARDS, but it can also be caused by a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) for patients on VA ECMO. It is recommended for patients on VV ECMO to use a humidifier on the ventilation tubing. Warming and humidifying the bronchial tree could minimize clot formation.\nThe aspect of the urine: Although rare, presence of blood in urine can occur. The urine color is then bright red. Be careful not to cofound it with the \u201cdark reddish\u201d color of the urine in case of hemolysis.\nThe digestive tract: Presence of blood in stools can be seen. If there is a doubt, use hydrogen peroxide on a stool sample. If foam appears, it means there is blood. In the absence of external bleeds or in severe DIC cases, a gastric lavage should be performed to check the presence or absence of blood.\nGeneral treatment: It is essential that the team understands and finds the right balance between pro- and anticoagulants to manage the patient properly. The daily blood count can assess the blood loss and the need to transfuse the patients with packed red blood cells or platelets. It is still a debate in the ECMO community to determine the cutoff for red blood cells transfusion; some teams (La Piti\u00e9 Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re is part of them) recommend to transfuse only when the hemoglobin is under 7 g/dL; others argue that an ECMO patient should have a normal hemoglobin to allow an optimized oxygenation, so that the transfusion limit will be 12 g/dL.For long, ECMO teams have been reluctant to discontinue heparin during ECMO runs. Experiences from several teams and data show that in case of severe hemorrhage and if the patient is nonresponsive to transfusion and a decrease rate of the heparin infusion, the discontinuation of the heparin is possible [5] for hours and even days, with a strict control of the aPPT and a thorough check of the oxygenator and cannulas looking for clots and thrombin. In a worst case scenario, using recombinant factor VIIa has been done safely by several teams with a major decrease of bleedings, but must be a last resort therapy with an extreme caution and surveillance of the ECMO circuit [6\u20138]\n",
