On the following day, the Federal Council of Medicine (CFM, Conselho Federal de Medicina) reinforced the recommendation of suspending elective medical consultations, but considered that if this is not possible, doctors can carry them out as long as they are in accordance with the determinations of the local authorities and the Service Technical-Director, respecting the recommended rules of hygiene, individual protection and contact restriction.",

Therefore, the recommendation is to restrict the number of elective face-to-face consultations, maintaining only the treatment of patients with diseases whose treatment cannot be postponed during this crisis period. We advise performing a telephone screening of patients with scheduled consultations or those who request elective appointments. Patients with fever, cough, sudden anosmia and/or flu-like symptoms without dyspnea should be instructed to undergo home isolation for 14 days. Patients with dyspnea or severe symptoms, on the other hand, should be instructed to seek emergency care in referral hospitals. If the doctor and the patient agree, elective consultations during the COVID-19 crisis may be carried out in the ways provided by Telemedicine, according to the new resolution by CFM and the Ministry of Health (described in detail in the section on telemedicine). In case of elective consultations that cannot be postponed, we suggest scheduling appointments at longer intervals between patients, in order to avoid the crowding of people at the reception or waiting room. In the absence of face-to-face care during this period, we suggest that doctors, if possible, offer a communication channel with patients, which allows for adequate recommendations.",

However, due to the lack of conclusive studies in relation to COVID-19 and extrapolating from the recommendations of systemic corticosteroids, we advise that chronic topical nasal corticosteroid use be maintained and continue to be indicated, and in the occurrence of fever or other symptoms suggestive of flu syndrome, the doctor may consider temporary interruption.

However, it was disclosed that the NISS could facilitate the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the lower airway or that it could spread the virus through the environment, but without scientific evidence to support it. Therefore, we recommend that chronic NISS use be maintained and continue to be indicated. The indication of NISS in acute infectious conditions should be assessed on a case-by-case basis in this context of COVID-19, as it is considered an option by the guidelines. However, we reinforce the need for adequate hygienization of the hands, nasal irrigation instruments and the environment in which the NISS is to be performed. Regarding the sinonasal endoscopic surgeries, especially those using drills or microdebriders, there have been reports of infection of the entire team in the room by a patient with COVID-19 in China, even with the use of adequate protective clothing and N95 masks. Therefore, in accordance with the CFM, we recommend not performing nasal or sinonasal surgeries in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In urgent cases or in case of extreme necessity to perform the surgery, we suggest performing the test to identify the new coronavirus (COVID-19) using the new 24-hour test.

In these cases, the tracheostomy is considered to prevent laryngotracheal stenosis, to accelerate weaning from mechanical ventilation and to facilitate the cleaning of respiratory secretions. Elective tracheostomy can be indicated from the 4th to the 21st day, most commonly between 10 and 14 days of intubation.",

When maintaining prolonged intubation, care should be taken to use tubes of the adequate size, with cuff pressure measurement, if used, and to maintain the child's comfort to avoid tube movement and damage to the laryngeal and tracheal mucosa. The indication for tracheostomy in children is more related to the lack of perspective to resolve mechanical ventilation dependence.",

Since the mean time of mechanical ventilation in the patient with COVID-19 is approximately 21 days, many of these patients could be considered candidates for conversion to tracheostomy. On the other hand, the tracheostomy is a procedure considered an aerosol generator, representing an increased risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to the surgical team and to the hospital environment through which the patient will move. Unlike droplets, which due to their weight and the effect of gravity have a limited transmission field, aerosols can remain in suspension for a long time and travel longer distances, with an increased risk of virus transmission. This occurs not only during the procedure, but also in the postoperative period, since the handling of a tracheostomy, with the need for frequent aspirations and the risk of decannulation with the need for repositioning, generates aerosols. Therefore, when considering carrying out the procedure, it is important to take into account patient severity, their prognosis and the risk of care team contamination, which are crucial for fighting the pandemic.",

            "text": "Therefore, we suggest avoiding the elective tracheostomy whenever possible in a patient with COVID-19. When tracheostomy is considered necessary, the following are recommended: avoid using an electric or ultrasonic scalpel as they may favor the formation of aerosols; do not use ventilation rooms with positive pressure, as they favor the dispersion of aerosols; whenever possible, use closed-circuit suction systems and antiviral filter and operating rooms with negative pressure. In their absence, use rooms with normal pressure and keep the doors closed; the surgical team must consist of the least possible number of professionals. In a patient with prolonged intubation, curarization is suggested, especially when removing the tube and placing the tracheostomy cannula, to minimize the risk of coughing, which promotes aerosolization. Another care procedure suggested by the Brazilian Society of Thoracic Surgery18 is the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, deflating the tracheal tube cuff and its disconnection from the ventilation system BEFORE the tracheal incision. After insertion of the tracheostomy cannula and cuff insufflation, the mechanical ventilation system can be connected, and ventilation restarted.",
