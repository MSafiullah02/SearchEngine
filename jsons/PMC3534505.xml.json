Although the majority of those infected by the influenza A/H1N1 virus presented mild symptoms that were self-limiting, a subgroup of patients followed an adverse clinical course, thus requiring a greater level of medical attention and more aggressive management\n[2]. In Mexico the lethal rate was estimated to be 1.2% for cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) and 5% for confirmed cases of influenza A/H1N1\n[3]. Some co-morbidities (e.g., immunosuppression, pre-existing pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, diabetes, asthma that requires regular medical attention, smoking, and obesity) have been demonstrated to increase the risk of hospitalization for infection with influenza A/H1N1\n[4,5]. The risk is also augmented in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and when treatment with oseltamivir is prescribed five days after the onset of the illness\n[6]. In addition, the results of certain laboratory tests (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), >600 IU/L; hypoxemia (PaO2, <60 mm Hg); C-reactive protein (CRP), 10 mg/dl; and leukopenia <5000/mm3) have been associated with greater mortality from infection by influenza A/H1N1 virus\n[7,8].",

The secretion of cytokines by infected cells appears to be necessary for the initiation of the immunological response that controls the replication of the virus\n[11]; in addition, the presence of immunopathological mechanisms, such as hypercytokinemia (\u201ccytokine storm\u201d), generally is considered to contribute to the severest evolution of the infection\n[11-13]. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12 IL-15, and IL-17) have been found, up to ten days after the onset of symptoms, in the plasma of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by influenza A/H1N1\n[9,10,14]. The genes that code for these molecules are polymorphic and certain alleles have been associated with susceptibility to various diseases that cover a wide range of pathologies, from infectious to oncological, including pulmonary and systemic diseases\n[15-30]. The role that the polymorphisms of the genes encoding these cytokines play in the severity of the disease is not clear.",
