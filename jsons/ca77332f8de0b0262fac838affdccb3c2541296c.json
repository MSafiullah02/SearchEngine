Seven of these vaccines have reached Phase III trial ( Table 2 ). Much of this recent interest has focussed on T-cell epitopes, with all of the vaccines to reach Phase III being T-cell based. For many diseases, however, B-cell responses also play an important role in immune protection, but peptide-based vaccines based on B-cell epitopes have proved more challenging for a number of reasons. Owing to the small size of peptides, they are generally poorly immunogenic. In addition, T-cell epitopes required for the establishment of a robust immune response may also be absent in smaller peptides. To address these issues, carrier proteins or adjuvants are typically included in the vaccine formulation. Peptides are also prone to enzymatic degradation; to combat this, the epitopes can be modified by conformational stabilization or cyclisation, or peptide mimetics that are resistant to proteolysis can be used.

Second, we describe the unique features of these antigens and their interactions with antibodies, highlighting those properties that render them particularly suited to the development of peptide vaccines. In particular, we note that disordered epitopes appear invariably to be linear epitopes, so the challenge of capturing conformational epitopes in a peptide vaccine may not apply.

Intrinsically disordered proteins are found throughout biology, [6] and are particularly enriched in the context of molecular signaling and regulatory functions. [7] Consistent with this regulatory role, the extent of disorder within the proteome of individual species tends to increase with the environmental complexity of the organisms life-cycle. [8] Thus, organisms that live in diverse or highly variable environments tend to have highly disordered proteomes, reflecting the need for sophisticated regulatory mechanisms to survive such environmental diversity. As a result, disordered proteins are particularly abundant in a range of pathogenic organisms, and in some viruses, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] which must survive diverse and often hostile host environments. In these contexts, disordered proteins play important roles in host-pathogen interactions, [11] and accordingly, disordered proteins are often exposed to the host immune system. [12] Even amongst bacteria, which have significantly more ordered proteomes than eukaryotic species, many proteins involved in pathogenic effector mechanisms appear to be disordered. [11] It is often assumed that disordered antigens impede the development of an effective immune response, and hence that their abundance represents an adaptive mechanism enabling the pathogen to evade the immune response. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Mechanisms proposed to account for this immune evasion are diverse and contested, and we critically assess several of these mechanisms in section 3 below. Despite the fact that these hypotheses have received limited direct experimental support, the underlying assumption that repetitive or disordered antigens will fail to elicit an effective antibody response continues to enjoy significant currency. [19] [20] [21] However, recent sequencing of the genomes of several species of parasite has demonstrated that low-complexity and disordered sequences are unusually abundant in a wide range of genes, including many that do not appear to be antigenically important. [22] This suggests that the presence of such sequences in these parasites is not primarily a strategy to evade the host immune response. This has prompted significant debate surrounding the mechanisms responsible for generating and maintaining this abundance of low-complexity sequence. [23] [24] [25] In fact, it seems likely that distinct classes of low-complexity sequences exist within parasite genomes, suggesting a diversity of contributory mechanisms.

It is not surprising, then, that a substantial fraction of malaria vaccine candidates contain regions of disorder, and that these regions are often important targets of antibodies. The most prominent example is the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the dominant antigen on the surface of the sporozoite, the parasite form that is injected into the host by the mosquito and which must replicate within host hepatocytes prior to the establishment of the symptomatic blood-stage infection. [26] CSP has been extensively studied as an antigen for inclusion in a malaria vaccine, and the recently-approved vaccine RTS,S includes the C-terminal half of CSP, fused to the hepatitis B S-antigen and assembled as a viruslike particle. [27] The RTS,S antigen includes the thrombospondin repeat domain at the C-terminus of CSP, although it is not clear that this domain is correctly folded in the vaccine formulation. [28] The rest of CSP is predicted to be disordered, and these predictions have been confirmed experimentally for the tetra-peptide repeats of CSP that appear to be immunodominant and are targets of protective antibodies induced by RTS,S. [29] [30] [31] [32] A second important malaria vaccine candidate that is entirely disordered is merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2). Antibodies targeting MSP2 arise in the course of malaria infection, and the presence of these antibodies correlates with protection from subsequent infection. [33] [34] [35] MSP2 also induces robust antibody responses when used as a vaccine, and these responses were shown to mediate protection in a Phase IIb trial in Papua New Guinea. [36, 37] The conformational and antigenic properties of MSP2 have been the subject of extensive study, [38] [39] [40] [41] providing important insights into the interplay between antigenicity and disorder, to which we will return in section 4 below.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 717, "end": 721, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 956, "end": 960, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1141, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1375, "end": 1379, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1380, "end": 1384, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1389, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1394, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1666, "end": 1670, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1671, "end": 1675, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1676, "end": 1680, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1848, "text": "[36,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1849, "end": 1852, "text": "37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1951, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1952, "end": 1956, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1957, "end": 1961, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1962, "end": 1966, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| I N TR ODU C TI ON"}, {"text": "Many additional antigens of significant interest as vaccine candidates against malaria and other diseases are known or predicted to be disordered, and we highlight a number of examples in Table 3 .

[45] This may reflect the fact that residues that score highly in disorder predictors are more likely to be solvent-exposed, [43] as solvent exposure is both a prerequisite for, and established predictor of, antigenicity. [46] 3.2 | Affinity maturation of antibodies to disordered antigens It has been argued that disordered antigens may impede the development of an effective immune response by interfering with the process by which B-cells mature and differentiate into memory or antibody producing cells. [14, 15, 40, 42] In the process of this maturation, antibodies undergo somatic hypermutation and selection for high-affinity antigen binding. This affinity maturation is essential to the development of a high-affinity and long-lived antibody response.

[43] Highly repetitive antigens are capable of eliciting B-cell responses that are independent of the T-cell help normally required for B-cell maturation. Such responses are characterized by defective affinity maturation and a failure to establish a conventional memory response. [47] As such, this has been proposed as one reason that B-cells to repetitive and disordered antigens may fail to mature. [15] Indeed, the repetitive malaria antigen CSP can induce a B-cell response in the absence of Tcell help, but this response is much weaker and more transient than that in the presence of T-cells. Thus, the normal response to this prototypical repetitive antigen is T-cell dependent. [48] FIG URE 1 Disordered antigens are bona fide targets of antibody recognition. A, Epitopes within disordered protein regions are more likely to be targets of positive antibody binding assays.

[51] Nonetheless, coupled folding and binding places both kinetic and thermodynamic constraints on the interaction. [52] In particular, the significant entropic cost of folding reduces the overall binding affinity of these interactions, unless this cost can be offset by other means. [53] Thus, the interactions of disordered proteins are often of relatively low affinity, despite maintaining high specificity. These properties are ideally suited to mediators of signals that must be switched on or off rapidly, accounting for the enrichment of disorder in proteins involved in signal transduction and regulation.

[54] [55] [56] In fact, using our dataset of ordered and disordered epitopes from the IEDB, we have shown that disorder accounts for very little of the wide variation observed in the affinities of antibodies for protein antigens. [43] Specifically, we observed an approximately seven-fold difference in median affinity between antibodies that recognize ordered epitopes and those that recognize disordered epitopes, a loss of affinity that is very much smaller than might be expected on the basis of the expected entropic cost of coupled folding and binding ( Figure 1C ). [54, 55] To investigate the structural basis for the relatively high affinity with which antibodies recognize disordered antigens, we crossreferenced our IEDB-derived dataset of ordered and disordered antigens with the Protein Databank (PDB), [57] resulting in a set of 872 structures of antibody-protein complexes, of which 69 represent disordered epitopes. [43] Comparison of these structures revealed that disordered epitopes involve substantially fewer residues than ordered epitopes, perhaps as a means to minimize the entropic cost of binding ( Figure 1D ). Thus, disordered epitopes rarely span more than 12 residues of the antigen primary sequence, and the majority of these residues make direct interactions with antibody. These structural observations are consistent with epitope mapping experiments with a large number of antibodies against several disordered antigens, [38] which imply that disordered epitopes are overwhelmingly linear epitopes, and that antibody recognition is determined largely by the local antigen sequence.

These structural features imply that antibodies to disordered epitopes are better matched to the bound conformation of that epitope than are antibodies to ordered epitopes. It is likely that this reflects to some extent the ability of the disordered epitope to adapt to its binding site on the antibody. Indeed, this flexibility permits some disordered epitopes to adopt distinct conformations bound to different antibodies.

The mAbs 4D11 and 9G8 are able to bind to parasite MSP2 by western blot and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) whilst the mAbs 9H4, 6C9 and 1F7, show significantly weaker signal by IFA and no binding by western blot, despite the five antibodies recognizing overlapping linear epitopes. The close proximity of the C-terminal region to the parasite surface via its GPI tether may influence the local conformation, making parts of the epitope inaccessible to antibody binding. Understanding the conformation of epitopes bound to antibodies such as 4D11 and 9G8 affords a good platform for further peptide vaccine design. By presenting the immune system with epitopes that are accessible on the parasite surface whilst removing distracting sequences, a more efficient and specific immune response may be elicited.Recently, the crystal structure of 4D11 Fv bound to its minimal binding epitope MSP2 215-222 , which it also shares with 9G8, was solved at 2.2 \u00c5.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
