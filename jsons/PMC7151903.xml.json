The AIDS pandemic is best described as the sum of discontinuous and overlapping epidemics of disease among populations of variable and varying risk (see Chapter 76). The predominant modes of transmission of HIV (perinatal, sexual, and parenteral) result in a bimodal distribution of disease, with peaks among young children and young adults. The risk of infection or disease due to tropical pathogens varies widely with differences in ecological, political, and socioeconomic conditions (including access to medical care); related specific host factors such as age of exposure, pregnancy, behavior, and nutrition; and host genetics. Disease due to a coinfecting pathogen may be due to primary infection, recurrent infection, or the reactivation of latent infection. For some pathogens, the risk factor responsible for the acquisition of HIV may also be the risk factor responsible for the acquisition of the coinfecting pathogen. As a consequence of this epidemiologic complexity, both the prevalence and the expression of coinfection are likely to be variable across ecological, economic, political, behavioral, and cultural divides.",

The ability to diagnose and monitor coinfection may be compromised by aberrant serologic responses, including false positives due to polyclonal B-cell activation, false negatives due to blunted antigen-specific antibody responses to newly acquired pathogens in late HIV disease, and false serologic reversion after treatment in late HIV disease.5 Diagnosis may also be hindered by unusual presentations of disease with coinfecting pathogens. Finally, a plethora of intercurrent pathologic conditions may lead to a dulling of Ockham's razor during the evaluation of disease in AIDS patients. A single pathogen, multiple pathogens, HIV infection, side effects of therapeutic drugs, or a combination of these may be responsible for the presenting complaints. Given the suboptimal response to the chemotherapy of many infections in the presence of profound immunosuppression, drugs may need to be given in greater numbers or for a longer duration. With many pathogens, in the absence of immune reconstitution resulting from highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), lifelong suppressive therapy is necessary. Drug therapy in the HIV-infected patient may be complicated further by increased rates of drug allergy as well as by untoward drug interactions in the setting of polypharmacy.16 Prophylaxis against coinfections may be compromised by substandard vaccination responses.17, 18, 19 Finally, the presence of HIV coinfection can complicate the public health consequences of tropical diseases. AIDS may increase the transmissibility of secondary infections and provide fertile soil for the development of drug resistance. Public health resources devoted to the AIDS pandemic may divert resources away from the control and prevention of other infectious diseases.",

Of the more than 100 agents known to cause OIs in AIDS patients, several are classic tropical pathogens.20 These are mostly found among the intracellular protozoans, bacteria, and endemic fungi; there is a marked absence of metazoans. Overall, the clinical expression of AIDS in many resource-poor areas of the tropics appears to involve a different spectrum of OIs than those common in North America and Europe. In place of the high incidences of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), disseminated Mycobacterium avium, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) found in the resource-rich north, the clinical expression of AIDS in much of the tropics has been marked by frequent tuberculosis (the most common serious AIDS OI in the world), chronic diarrhea, wasting, chronic fever without an obvious localizing source, and pulmonary disease.23\n",

Understanding the spectrum of AIDS-associated OIs in any given area depends on the presence of adequate surveillance systems, which are often lacking in resource-poor regions of the tropics. In the presence of inadequate infrastructures, limited financial resources, and difficult access to medical care on the part of the socially disadvantaged, surveillance is likely to be sporadic and to involve mainly the sampling of subgroups of AIDS patients at late stages of disease.21 Where resources are limited, diagnostic reporting is likely to be biased in favor of OIs that are inexpensive to diagnose (or misdiagnose).21 Even the common impression that the progression of AIDS is more rapid in sub-Saharan Africa than in industrialized countries24, 25, 26, 27 rests on data that are less than robust.28 A more rapid observed course (presumed due to a higher frequency and virulence of coinfection and problems of nutrition and access to medical care) may represent in large part a systematic bias in favor of later initial diagnosis of HIV infection and AIDS.21,\n23 Conversely, it has been suggested that the burden of illness and mortality in early HIV disease (often unrecognized as such) due to high-grade pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the salmonellae, may rival that due to the OIs of late-stage AIDS in the tropics.29,\n30\n",

The central role of ongoing viral replication in HIV pathogenesis is firmly established, and the set point concentration of plasma viremia correlates well with long-term clinical outcome.31 It is presumed that any increases in viral replication have the potential for accelerating the course of disease. Efficient replication of HIV in CD4+ T cells is dependent on cellular activation. Similarly, activation of monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells can stimulate HIV replication by increasing transcription factor binding to the HIV long terminal repeat region (LTR), enhancing LTR-directed transcription. Coinfecting pathogens can stimulate such immune cell activation either directly (e.g., stimulating signaling through pathogen recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors32 or upregulating transcription factor transactivation in coinfected immune cells) or indirectly (e.g., promoting the generation of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1] or activating CD4+ T cells as part of the adaptive immune response). Immune activation can also lead to upregulation of the expression of HIV coreceptors,33 thereby facilitating the infection of fresh cells.",

            "text": "In addition to the viral sequelae of generalized immuno-logic activation, induction of specific alterations in the immunoregulatory environment of the host by ubiquitous tropical pathogens has been postulated to accelerate the course of HIV. Cross-regulating subsets of CD4+ T cells have been distinguished by their cytokine profiles and functional activities: Th1 cells (producing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, among other cytokines) are important in classical macrophage activation, the development of CMI, and the generation of humoral responses involving complement-fixing antibody isotypes; Th2 cells (producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, among other cytokines) are important in alternative macrophage activation, the generation of immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses, eosinophilia, mast cell responses, and atopy. The immunologic response to most helminthic parasites is dominated by the production of Th2 cytokines. Evidence from murine systems shows that helminth-driven Th2 polarization can shift the immunologic response to heterologous antigens and pathogens from a Th1- to a Th2-dominant pattern, as well as significantly suppress CD8-mediated viral clearance.60,\n61 Such responses have also been found to impair antigen-specific Th1 immune responses in both mice and humans.60,\n62 Helminthic infection is chronic and widespread in the tropics. The resultant Th2 \u201cpriming\u201d of the immune system may favor progression of HIV disease.63 Several mechanisms have been postulated. First, a Th2-polarized immune system may directly suppress CD8 T cell\u2013mediated anti-HIV responses.61 Second, HIV may preferentially replicate in Th2 cells.64 Third, T cells from HIV-seropositive people undergo abnormal activation-induced apoptosis,9,\n10 which is thought to play a role in the depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells over time. Th2 cytokines can amplify such activation-induced apoptosis.65 Fourth, Th2 cytokines can upregulate HIV coreceptor expression by CD4+ T cells and monocyte/macrophages.66,\n67 Of note, it has been demonstrated that peripheral blood cells from patients with intestinal helminth infection are more susceptible to in vitro infection with HIV than are cells from helminth-uninfected patients.68,\n69\n",

Whether disease is present or not, sterile immunity is not thought to be achieved after infection with most intracellular protozoans. This is as much the case with the tropical and subtropical agents of leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease as it is with the ubiquitous agent of toxoplasmosis. These are thus lifelong infections, with serious disease often resulting when an HIV-infected host defaults on his or her side of these immunologic \u201cnegotiations.\u201d From the point of view of the clinician in a nonendemic area, this necessitates obtaining a lifetime travel history for all HIV-infected patients. From the perspective of the clinician from either endemic or nonendemic areas, it is equally necessary to have an appropriate index of suspicion for HIV coinfection when contemplating the possibility of a tropical infectious disease. In the process of giving this important virus its diagnostic due, however, it is critical to avoid letting the presence or suspicion of HIV infection distract from the careful consideration of etiologic agents that present and respond similarly in HIV-seronegative and HIV-seropositive people.",

            "text": "The first significant clinical effect of HIV on malaria was found in the setting of pregnancy. In areas of high malarial endemnicity, the high degree of immunity that women of childbearing age have developed to severe malaria is compromised by pregnancy. The placental vasculature shields parasitized erythrocytes from the systemic immune response, allowing localized erythrocytic replication of the parasite. Placental parasitemia has been associated with low birth weight and, hence, increased infant mortality. Local uteroplacental immune responses do restrict parasite replication, however, and the effectiveness of these local responses increases in subsequent pregnancies under pressure of recurrent malarial exposure. In 1996, a study performed in rural Malawi demonstrated that the beneficial effects (maternal, placental, and neonatal) of parity in the control of parasitemia during pregnancy were markedly attenuated in the face of HIV coinfection.22 Since then, multiple studies performed in sub-Saharan Africa have probed the effects of coinfection on the outcome of pregnancy.90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 Such studies have shown that (1) HIV infection is associated with increased rates and levels of peripheral and placental parasitemia, clinical malaria, and maternal anemia in pregnant women, and (2) coinfection is associated with a higher risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, intrauterine growth retardation, and postnatal infant mortality.101 Although placental parasitemia is associated with increased placental HIV viral loads in coinfected patients,90 it remains unclear as to whether malaria infection increases the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Conflicting results (enhancement, protection, and no effect) have been published.96,\n97,\n100 A World Health Organization (WHO) technical consultation has recommended that HIV-infected pregnant women who are at risk for malaria should always have protection with insecticide-treated bed nets, along with (according to HIV stage) either intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine or daily trimethoprim\u2013 sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole; TMP\u2013SMX) prophylaxis.102\n",

A variety of protease inhibitors, as well as the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors delaviradine and efavirenz, inhibit hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes. Principal effects are on the CYP3A4 isoform (with ritonavir being the most potent inhibitor), although the CYP2D6 isoform may also be affected.109,\n110 Nevirapine and efavirenz cause secondary induction of CYP3A4, an effect of ritonavir and nelfinavir as well.109,\n110 Most antimalarial agents are largely metabolized via P-450 enzymes. Mefloquine appears to be no exception, although the details remain poorly understood.111 Proguanil and chloroquine metabolism appears to be largely by the CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 isoforms, respectively.112, 113, 114, 115 Chloroquine also undergoes appreciable renal excretion, whereas doxycycline largely avoids these pathways in vivo. A detailed understanding of atovaquone metabolism appears to be lacking. Actual published pharmacokinetic data suggest that (1) there are no significant drug\u2013drug interactions between nelfinavir or indinavir and mefloquine116; (2) ritonavir has minimal effects on mefloquine pharmacokinetics, whereas mefloquine suppresses ritonavir plasma levels117; and (3) atovaquone increases serum zidovudine (AZT) levels by approximately 30%, although AZT has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone.118 In summary, the actual pharmacokinetics are not easily predictable from theoretical considerations, and there is a paucity of data. Based on the current data, mefloquine, doxycycline, chloroquine, and malarone (atovaquone + proguanil) are likely to be safe and to retain efficacy for prophylaxis of sensitive strains of malaria.",

There are no actual data, however. Whether there are clinically relevant effects of these protease inhibitors on the metabolism of artemisinin compounds (dependent at least in part on CYP3A4) remains unknown. Uncomplicated malaria can probably be safely treated with chloroquine (if sensitive), pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine, or mefloquine. Use of quinine, quinidine, or artemisinin compounds remains essential for the parenteral therapy of severe chloroquine-resistant malaria. For those on ritonavir (and/or other protease inhibitors, delaviridine, or efavirenz), the normal loading dose of quinine or quinidine should probably be given, along with some reduction of the maintenance infusion dose. Obviously, careful monitoring needs to be done for the potentially fatal arrhythmic consequences of quinine/quinidine overdosage in this setting. Given the lack of data, however, underdosing may also be a potential problem. The \u201cwashout\u201d period for the metabolic effects of ritonavir is thought to be 24 to 48 hours.",

Human babesial disease has been reported mostly from temperate climates (see Chapter 91). A significant clinical interaction with HIV infection has been suggested for Babesia microti, raising the possibility that disease with tropical babesial species may be a risk for AIDS patients and providing the rationale for the current discussion. There are five reported cases of babesiosis due to B. microti in HIV-infected people.122, 123, 124, 125, 126 Two cases occurred in splenectomized patients; in one, chronic low-level hemolysis due to Babesia prior to splenectomy was likely. Patients with intact spleens presented with fevers of unknown origin (FUOs) in the face of CD4 counts less than 200/\u03bcL. In one, the FUO lasted for months and was associated with night sweats, dry cough, weight loss, and dyspnea on exertion. Persistent parasitemia after clinically successful chemotherapy led to the need for chronic suppressive therapy. In another patient, recurrent disease led to retreatment 8 months after initial therapy. Quinine plus clindamycin and atovaquone plus azithromycin both have therapeutic efficacy in acute disease.127 In HIV-infected patients, chronic suppressive therapy appears to be indicated. As with all vector-borne diseases, vector avoidance is the most efficient way to prevent disease. Significant interactions with HIV infection remain to be described for European bovine Babesia species (Babesia bovis and Babesia divergens) and the emerging agents of human babesiosis (WA1, CA1, MO1) in North America.",

The competence of the Th1 axis of cellular response becomes increasingly compromised during the progression of HIV-related immunosuppression, providing a favorable environment for disease due to Leishmania species. Furthermore, in vitro evidence suggests that coinfection of macrophages with HIV and Leishmania can directly upregulate parasite replication.128 In vivo, the overall loss of immunological control of parasite infection is reflected by often aberrant manifestations of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in AIDS, including peripheral parasitemia (found in more than 50% of coinfected people) and parasite dissemination to unusual body compartments.129 An AIDS-related OI occurring at low CD4+ T-cell counts, leishmaniasis may be due either to primary Leishmania infection or to the reactivation of clinically latent infection.130,\n131 Although the published data on the interaction of HIV and Leishmania focus largely on the effects of HIV on leishmanial infection and disease, it should be noted that there is also both in vitro and in vivo evidence that Leishmania can augment HIV replication.132, 133, 134, 135\n",

Gradoni and associates161 suggested that this type of serologic data could be used as an indicator of the sequence of acquisition of the two infections. Support for this concept is provided by a report from Ethiopia of seven cases of VL with HIV coinfection, all with highly elevated antileishmanial antibody titers.162 All patients had lived for many years in a leishmaniasis-endemic area of Ethiopia.162 The recombinant antigen rK-39 appears to be highly sensitive and specific for immunodiagnosis of VL due to L. donovani and L. chagasi in patients without complicating HIV infection; however, the sensitivity of rK-39 for immunodiagnosis of cutaneous cases from Turkey was greatly reduced compared with most cases of VL.163 The utility of rK-39-based diagnostics is not clear in HIV-seropositive people. The peripheral parasitemia displayed by many HIV coinfected individuals allows the detection of parasites from the blood in approximately 50% of cases. Cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of buffy-coat preparations are positive in 70% and up to 100%, respectively.130,\n131,\n164\n",

Liposomally encapsulated amphotericin has the theoretical advantage of being targeted to monocyte/macrophages, host cells for leishmanial parasites. Between 40% and 65% of coinfected patients have initial parasitological cure after treatment with pentavalent antimonials, amphotericin B deoxycholate, or amphotericin B lipid complex.150,\n167,\n168 Among these options, treatment with lipid formulations of amphotericin B appears to have similar efficacy, but less severe toxicity, than the other drugs. However, the experience with lipid formulations of amphotericin B in coinfected patients remains meager.168 These lipid formulations are also quite expensive. Trials aimed at optimizing the therapy of VL in AIDS are clearly needed.168 Even with initial cure, relapse is predictable over time, occurring in up to 80% of coinfected individuals within 1 year.150,\n167,\n169 The optimal drug for secondary prophylaxis remains unclear.

Because the HIV-related Chagas' disease reported to date largely represents reactivation of chronic infection during the course of HIV-induced immunosuppression and not primary infection in the face of AIDS (which is not surprising given the differing patterns of epidemiological risk for these infections: largely rural for T. cruzi and largely urban for HIV), this OI can be expected to appear outside these geographic bounds. It should be noted that activation of latent T. cruzi infection, as well as exacerbated primary infection (transmitted by blood transfusion), is also well described in the face of the iatrogenic immunosuppression used for solid organ transplantation and therapy for hematological malignancies.",

Clinically, such reactivation most commonly involves the central nervous system.179,\n180\nTrypanosoma cruzi was probably late in being recognized as an opportunistic pathogen in those with HIV infection because the most prominent features of central nervous system disease are similar to those of toxoplasmic meningoencephalitis. Enlargement of hemorrhagic foci can produce mass effects simulating brain tumors. Lesions are often multiple, with computed tomographic (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing ring enhancement and preferential involvement of the white matter. Toxoplasmic encephalitis may also be present in the same patient.181 The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings include a slight pleocytosis, increased protein, slightly decreased glucose in some patients, and the presence of trypanosomes. Histologically, the brain lesions show necrotic foci with hemorrhage and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Amastigote forms of the parasite are abundant in glial cells and macrophages and only occasionally in neuronal cells. Myocarditis is a common autopsy finding in those dying of AIDS-related T. cruzi meningoencephalitis.178 Such myocarditis is often clinically silent. Clinical manifestations, when present, involve arrhythmias and congestive heart failure.179,\n182,\n183 Correct diagnosis of reactivated T. cruzi infection depends, first, on considering the possibility based on the geographic origin of the patient and on an appreciation of the clinical picture. If neurologic signs are present, performing a CT scan or MRI is key.184 The imaging pattern of central nervous system (CNS) T. cruzi infection is indistinguishable from that of toxoplasmic encephalitis. Direct microscopic examination of centrifuged sediment of CSF will often show motile trypanosomes. If fever and other systemic signs are present, direct examination of the buffy coat from the microhematocrit tube may also show motile trypanosomes. Since serum antibodies to T. cruzi indicate previous infection with the parasite, this test is only useful for ruling out reactivated infection if it is negative. If other tests are inconclusive, biopsy of a brain lesion to demonstrate characteristic organisms can be done. PCR on blood or CSF requires research laboratory facilities.",

            "text": "Clinically, differentiating HIV-related reactivation of Chagas' disease reactivation from chronic chagasic disease may be difficult. HIV-related reactivation is associated with high parasitemia, however, whereas the parasitemia of chronic disease is very low.185 Indeed, even in the absence of overt, clinical reactivation, chronic Chagas' disease is associated with a higher percentage and level of parasitemia in those coinfected with HIV (independent of CD4 count) than in HIV seronegatives.186 The effects of coinfection appear to be bidirectional. HIV viral load was carefully documented to increase simultaneously with an asymptomatic increase in T. cruzi parasitemia, subsequently returning to baseline in the face of successful antiparasitic treatment.187 Nifurtimox and benznidazole, both of which have moderate antitrypanosomal activity, are the standard drugs recommended for treatment of Chagas' disease. There simply is not enough experience to evaluate the effectiveness of these drugs in the treatment of T. cruzi infections complicating HIV or AIDS, especially in cases with meningoencephalitis. No information is available on the penetration of these drugs into the CNS, and the survival time of reported cases of coinfection has been short. A patient reported by Nishioka and coworkers188 survived for 92 days, with disappearance of trypanosomes from the blood and CSF as well as clearance of a brain lesion while being treated with benznidazole at a dose of 8 mg/kg/day for 80 days. Clinical improvement and reduction in size of a brain lesion were attributed to treatment with benznidazole plus, later, itraconazole and fluconazole in another patient with coinfection who survived for at least 6 months.189 Although there is no other reported experience with the use of itraconazole or fluconazole in the treatment of American trypanosomiasis in humans, itraconazole was reported to be very effective in experimental infections.190 Infected mice given as little as 15 mg/kg/day were protected against death, and concentrations of itraconazole as low as 0.001 \u03bcg/mL inhibited replication of the parasites in macrophages. It has been recommended that treatment of T. cruzi infection in HIV-positive individuals be started early in the reactivation process, when parasitemia is detectable, but before irreversible end-organ damage has occurred.187 Such a strategy would hinge on serological identification of those at risk, something indicated in all HIV-infected individuals with appreciable risk of T. cruzi infection. Although data are lacking, it should be noted that immunological reconstitution through HAART therapy is likely to provide considerable prophylactic and therapeutic benefit in this disease.",

Some patients, immunocompromised as well as immunocompetent, are refractory to standard therapeutic regimens for giardiasis. It may well be that such refractoriness to standard therapy is found more commonly in the face of HIV coinfection.262\n",

More subtle interactions have been explored in schistosomiasis (see Chapter 116). Study of car washers working on the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya, a population with a high intensity of exposure to S. mansoni and an HIV seroprevalence of approximately 30%, has provided insights into the bidirectional effects of coinfection.264 The CD4+ T cell\u2013dependent granulomatous response to schistosome eggs has been shown to be important in egg migration from venules to the lumen of the intestine in mouse models of disease.264 As might thereby be expected, a significant suppression of egg excretion efficiency, controlled for the degree of infection, was found in S. mansoni\u2013infected patients in the presence of HIV coinfection and low CD4+ T-cell counts.265 Although successful therapy of S. mansoni infection with praziquantel may depend on the host antibody response, praziquantel was efficacious in treating schistosomiasis in this HIV-infected cohort.266 Given that schistosome infection likely preceded HIV infection in these individuals, whether praziquantel will have equal efficacy in individuals infected with HIV first remains an open question. Notably, despite similar responses to therapy, individuals with HIV coinfection and low CD4+ T cell counts showed increased susceptibility to reinfection after therapy,267 a response that appears to correlate with blunted immunological responses to successful drug therapy (and the resultant release of parasite antigen) in such individuals.268 A study of HIV/S. haematobium coinfection in Zambia led to findings that mirror these findings with S. mansoni: (1) Coinfected individuals had lower egg excretion, and (2) praziquantel retained efficacy in the face of HIV coinfection.269 No alteration in resistance to reinfection with S. haemotobium was seen in the face of HIV infection, but CD4+ T-cell counts were not performed in this cohort lacking evident HIV-related disease. It thus remains possible that, as with S. mansoni infection, resistance to reinfection with S. haematobium is decreased with progression of HIV/AIDS.",

Indeed, it has been demonstrated that peripheral blood cells from patients with intestinal helminth infection68 (and filarial infection69) are more susceptible to in vitro infection with HIV than are cells from helminth-uninfected patients. The overall hypothesis remains unproven, however. An initial study from Ethiopia indicated that HIV viral load was significantly higher in individuals with various helminthic infections than in individuals without helminths, correlating positively with the parasite load as well as decreasing after elimination of the worms by antiparasitic treatment.70 However, similar studies performed in Uganda and examining far larger numbers of patients have convincingly failed to replicate these findings.71,\n72 These latter studies strongly suggest that helminth coinfection is not associated with faster progression of HIV disease.",

In northern Thailand, up to one-fourth of AIDS patients suffer disease with it, whereas in southern Thailand the prevalence is 10-fold less.320 The environmental reservoir for P. marneffei is unknown, but the organism has been isolated from the organs, feces, and burrows of three species of bamboo rats. The geographic range of these rodents overlaps the previously mentioned known areas of endemicity for disease with P. marneffei\n317, 318, 319 and suggests the likelihood that this fungus is also endemic in Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia.316 Whether bamboo rats are important reservoirs for human infection or just another natural host is unclear. There is no evidence of transmission between rats and humans. The seasonal distribution of the diagnosis of disseminated disease in AIDS patients suggests that the reservoir for P. marneffei expands during the rainy season.317 Exposure to soil appears to be a key factor.322\n",

The fact that reactivation with increasing immunosuppression occurs is supported by the several cases of disseminated disease reported from nonendemic areas in AIDS patients who had a distant history of travel to endemic areas.324,\n325 Many such patients had spent little time in endemic areas, indicating that infection with P. marneffei can occur rapidly. The development of clinically active disease within weeks of exposure in endemic areas326 and the reports of children with vertically transmitted HIV infection developing disease in the first months and years of life327 demonstrate that primary infection can quickly lead to disseminated disease. Finally, the pronounced seasonal variation in disease incidence implies an important role for exogenous reinfection in the expression of disease with P. marneffei in AIDS patients in endemic areas.317\n",

Diagnosis depends on a high index of suspicion, including a careful history to assess possible residence or travel in an endemic area. The differential diagnosis includes tuberculosis, other endemic fungi, and cryptococcosis. Cutaneous lesions may mimic those of AIDS-related molluscum contagiosum, Histoplasma capsulatum and Cryptococcus neoformans. An absence of cutaneous lesions may retard diagnosis. In this regard, a characteristic syndrome of hepatic disease in the absence of skin lesions (fever, hepatomegaly, and markedly elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels) should be noted.328 A presumptive diagnosis can be made by the examination of a Wright's-stained bone marrow aspirate, lymph node aspirate, or touch preparations of skin biopsy specimens.316,\n318,\n329 Intracellular and extracellular basophilic elliptic yeast-like organisms with central septation (as opposed to the budding of H. capsulatum) are characteristic. Indirect fluorescent antibody reagents have been developed that may prove useful for differentiating P. marneffei from H. capsulatum and C. neoformans in tissue.330 Characteristic intracellular organisms have been detected on routine blood smears.331 In the previously discussed series, definitive diagnosis was performed by culture of P. marneffei from blood (76%, even in the absence of routine lysis-centrifugation culture), skin biopsy (90%), bone marrow (100%), and sputum (34%). Diagnostic antigenemia tests that may prove valuable for rapid diagnosis have been developed.332,\n333 Quantitation of urinary antigen by enzyme immunoassay (employing rabbit hyperimmune IgG) is especially promising: High sensitivity and specificity were demonstrated in an area of high endemnicity.334 Of note, P. marneffei infection is a known cause of false-positive reactions in the H. capsulatum polysaccharide antigen immunoassay.335 Current serologic assays are unlikely to be helpful in the diagnosis of AIDS patients but, with improved sensitivity, may provide a useful index of infection.330,\n336\n",

Acute, juvenile disease, occurring in children and young adults and accounting for a small minority of cases (3% to 5%), is marked by a rapid course, disseminated involvement of monocyte/macrophages and lymphoid tissue, and severe suppression of CMI. Chronic, adult disease, accounting for the vast majority of cases, is a slowly progressive disease, predominantly of older men. In most patients, the primary clinical and pathologic manifestations are pulmonary, with nodular, infiltrative, or cavitary lesions progressing to fibrosis. Other frequent manifestations of adult disease include infiltrative and ulcerative mucosal lesions of the oro- and nasopharynx, polymorphic cutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, and adrenal infiltration.

The high prevalence of cryptococcal disease in these same series, which is thought to occur at similar levels of immunosuppression, suggests that this is not the complete answer.382 Diagnostic difficulties may also play a role, but these have been well addressed in several of the cited studies.",

CD4+ T-cell counts are suppressed in tuberculosis patients, both with and without HIV coinfection, and rise with therapy for tuberculosis.412\n",

In the absence of HAART, however, the death rate for those under treatment for tuberculosis is higher for people with HIV infection alone, mainly due to other OIs. Conflicting reports on increased rates of tuberculosis recurrence in the face of HIV coinfection431 have not provided sufficient evidence for increasing the duration of treatment. Combining HAART with tuberculosis treatment is difficult for several reasons: overlapping toxicity profiles of some antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs, drug interactions, and nonadherence with complicated treatment regimens.432 An important problem is the possibility of paradoxical reactions. Such reactions include the transient worsening or appearance of new signs, symptoms, or radiographic manifestations of tuberculosis within days to weeks after initiating antiretroviral treatment. These reactions, likely due to immune reconstitution, may be particularly severe when HAART is started soon after initiating treatment for active tuberculosis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/American Thoracic Society recommendations for tuberculosis treatment are to (1) continue previously started HAART; (2) avoid initiating HAART and tuberculosis therapy at the same time; and (3) always start tuberculosis therapy first, delaying HAART initiation until the first 1 or 2 months of tuberculosis therapy have been completed.432\n",

The importance of CMI in leprosy and leishmaniasis was emphasized by Turk and Bryceson466 in their detailed comparison of skin lesions and histopathology of both diseases. Moreover, the immunopathology of both infections is very similar. In view of the widespread prevalence of leprosy in the tropics and subtropics, the immunosuppressive effects of HIV or AIDS on leprosy would be expected to become readily apparent, but there is little or no evidence of this interaction.

Patients with lepromatous leprosy have a negative lepromin skin test, and biopsies of their skin lesions lack a granulomatous response and show large numbers of organisms (multibacillary).

Another comparison of seropositivity for HIV was carried out among 189 new cases of leprosy matched for age, sex, and district of residence with 481 controls in Uganda. No significant difference in overall positive rates was found (12% in cases vs. 18% in controls), but again, positive HIV reactions were more frequent among multibacillary cases.469 A different clinical association was noted in Zambia in leprosy patients with active neuritis, which suggested that HIV- positive cases had poorer recovery of nerve function than controls after treatment with steroids.470\n",

There is a suggestion from several of the reports cited previously that multibacillary disease may develop under the influence of HIV infection; however, there are several features of leprosy that may tend to obscure an interaction with HIV infection. Both infections are chronic and slow in their progression, so it may simply take more time to recognize an influence of one on the other. Leprosy is predominantly a rural infection involving people not yet caught up with the ravages of HIV and AIDS. Patients with AIDS in the tropics may not survive long enough to display interactions with leprosy. Finally, patients in the early stages of leprosy have relatively subtle clinical manifestations with which physicians in the urban environment may not be familiar. Therefore, there may be more going on out there than we realize.

The diagnosis can be established by the isolation of M. genavense from normally sterile sites (blood, bone marrow, lymph node, and spleen). Specific diagnosis is confounded by the fastidious growth requirements of the organism. Primary isolation on solid media is difficult, and growth in liquid broth may have only 50% sensitivity. Definitive identification demands PCR techniques.476 The clear implication is that a significant percentage of cases ascribed to disseminated M. avium are likely due to M. genavense.\n479 Data on treatment are all retrospective, but therapy appears to be associated both with improvement in symptoms and with survival.

Mycobacterium kansasii is second to MAC among nontuberculous mycobacteria as a cause of disease in HIV-infected patients in the United States.485 Although M. kansasii has been reported as a cause of pulmonary disease in most areas of the world, most case reports of HIV coinfection are from North America and Europe. However, coinfection may be especially prevalent in the gold mines of the Transvaal in South Africa.486 In HIV-infected individuals, disease due to M. kansasii and M. tuberculosis has very similar clinical and radiological characteristics.487 A major difference (with epidemiological and prognostic implications) is that M. kansasii disease tends to occur later in the course of HIV infection. The mean CD4+ T-cell count at the time of presentation is approximately 50 to 60/\u03bcL487, 488, 489; 60% to 90% present with pulmonary disease alone and 20% to 35% with disseminated disease.489,\n490 The incidence in industrialized countries has plummeted in the HAART era.491 With all nontuberculous mycobacteria, differentiation between colonization, contamination, and disease can be problematic. Mere colonization of the respiratory tract with M. kansasii appears to be infrequent in AIDS patients, however. All pulmonary isolates should be taken seriously.488,\n490 Despite relative in vitro resistance to isoniazid,491 the recommended therapy is isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol. Therapy clearly alters survival in patients with pulmonary disease.489,\n490,\n492 Disseminated disease has a particularly poor prognosis.",

            "text": "Along with other genital inflammatory or ulcerative diseases, syphilis (see Chapter 44) has been implicated as a cofactor in HIV transmission. Many case reports have suggested that HIV infection can alter the course of disease with Treponema pallidum. In the presence of concurrent HIV infection, syphilis has been thought to (1) progress more frequently and rapidly to neurosyphilis,519,\n520 (2) lead to an increased incidence of meningitic manifestations of neurosyphilis,521 (3) lead to an increased frequency of \u201cmalignant secondary syphilis\u201d with ulcerating lesions and prominent systemic symptoms,522 and (4) be less amenable to successful therapy with standard regimens as assessed by clinical or serologic measures (including a lack of appropriate nontreponemal titer reduction or a serologic relapse).523, 524, 525, 526, 527 Such concerns, based largely on case reports and retrospective studies, were amplified by the disconcerting finding of T. pallidum invasion of the CNS in early syphilis in HIV-infected patients. Such early invasion of the CNS occurs equally frequently in HIV-seropositive and -seronegative people, however,528 and the \u201catypical\u201d courses of syphilis described previously were well-known in the pre-AIDS era. Knowledge of the actual frequency and relative significance of such events has awaited well-designed prospective studies. Three studies now provide evidence that the clinical presentation and clinical and serologic responses to treatment of syphilis may not be appreciably altered by HIV coinfection.529, 530, 531 A major caveat of these studies is that the mean level of immunosuppression in the patients in these studies, as assessed by CD4+ T-cell counts, was not severe. Furthermore, the number of patients involved was relatively small. Thus, the clinical course of syphilis in the face of severe HIV-induced immunosuppression may in fact be exacerbated, and the response to conventional therapy may lead to the infrequent occurrence of serious adverse treatment outcomes.531 The clinical approach to the HIV patient infected with this cosmopolitan sexually transmitted disease (STD) has been thoroughly discussed elsewhere76, 77, 78, 79\n532,\n533 and will likely continue to evolve.",

As with other such parasites, host defense against infection appears to depend on specific T-cell activation of the microbicidal effector functions of infected cells.539 Radiation, cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, and pregnancy have led to reactivation of disease in animal models.539 Case series have suggested that patients with immunocompromise due to a variety of causes (including leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, bone marrow and renal transplantation, and alcoholism) are more susceptible to both symptomatic acute and relapsing or chronic disease with C. burnetii.\n540, 541, 542 The rationale for expecting more frequent or serious disease in the HIV-infected patient is clear. The data are less so. A study from southern France demonstrated a threefold higher prevalence of antibodies to C. burnetii in HIV-seropositive people.543 This suggestion of an increased rate of transmission in HIV-infected people has not been found in other seroprevalence studies from Paris, Spain, or the Central African Republic.544, 545, 546 Given the differential prevalence of risk factors for the acquisition of HIV infection between the studies, the contradictory data strongly suggest that C. burnetii can be blood-borne and that intravenous drug use is a risk for its transmission. Two studies from southern Europe have further suggested that HIV infection leads to a higher disease-infection ratio with C. burnetii.543,\n547 A retrospective serologic study of 520 patients with acute Q fever from an area of Spain with a high incidence of both HIV and C. burnetii infection revealed no overrepresentation of HIV-infected people, however.546 The clinical features of Q fever do not appear to vary between HIV-infected and -uninfected hosts.543,\n545, 546, 547 However, definitive statements await prospective studies in severely immunosuppressed AIDS patients.",

Data from the tropics on enteric bacterial pathogens are scant. Studies of slim disease (enteropathic AIDS) have not revealed an enteric bacterial cause in most cases.304,\n458,\n459 The prevalence of certain enteric pathogens such as Campylobacter, vibrios, and enteropathogenic E. coli in the tropics has not been accurately assessed because their detection requires the use of special media and experienced laboratory personnel. In the case of less fastidious organisms that are easier to detect, such as Salmonella spp., the phenomenon of bacteremia with nontyphoid organisms has been noted in tropical Africa.29 Since bacteremia with Shigella spp. probably occurs more commonly in patients with HIV disease,565 this association may be expected to occur in the tropics as well. There is no reported evidence to suggest that cholera is altered in the presence of HIV, although the gastric secretory failure that occurs commonly in AIDS may lead to a greater susceptibility to infection to Vibrio cholerae.\n566,\n567 It should be noted that although the live oral cholera vaccine is considered to be contraindicated in people with HIV infection by the USPHS\u2013IDSA working group,213 it has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in HIV-infected adults in Mali.568 Further details on the association of HIV and enteric bacterial infections, including therapy, are presented in Chapters 16 through 21Chapter 16Chapter 17Chapter 18Chapter 19Chapter 20Chapter 21 and in reviews elsewhere.76,\n77\n",

The globally endemic Bartonella species, Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana (see Chapter 40), cause acute and persistent bacteremia as well as localized tissue infection (including bacillary angiomatosis, bacillary peliosis, microscopic abscess formation, and lymphadenitis), primarily in AIDS patients and other immunocompromised people.572 The closely related species Bartonella bacilliformis, which is geographically restricted to Andean river valleys, causes a similar spectrum of disease (including acute and persistent bacteremia and hemangiomatous nodules resembling those seen in bacillary angiomatosis) in immunologically normal hosts (see Chapter 40). Cases of coinfection with HIV and B. bacilliformis do not appear to have been reported.",

In part, of course, this may be a function of a lack of sufficient experience with coinfection with these agents. Among the flaviviruses, (1) two uncontrolled series of patients with St. Louis encephalitis in Texas have suggested the possibility that the ratio of disease to infection, but not the course of symptomatic disease, is worsened in the presence of HIV infection,573,\n574 and (2) there are insufficient data to determine whether HIV alters the course of yellow fever (no case reports; 20% to 50% mortality in the absence of coinfection575), West Nile virus infection (single case report576), or dengue infection (single case report577). Interestingly, the case report of dengue coinfection suggests that dengue fever, like acute measles and scrub typhus, may lead to a reversible suppression of HIV replication.577\n",

There are theoretical risks of vaccine-induced encephalitis and/or hepatic damage due to prolonged viremia in the immunodeficient.575 A handful of cases of postvaccinial encephalitis or multiple organ failure (yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease [YEL-AVD]) have been reported in presumably immunocompetent patients (against a denominator of approximately 400 million people vaccinated).575 Of note, 4 of 23 vaccinees who developed YEL-AVD had undergone thymectomy for thymomas, raising the concern that deficient thymic function may permit fatal vaccine-induced viral infections.578 A single case has also been reported of fatal myeloencephalitis after vaccination in a Thai man with asymptomatic HIV infection, albeit a low CD4+ T-cell count and a high viral load.579 Approximately 100 asymptomatic HIV-seropositive U.S. military personnel received yellow fever vaccination prior to the introduction of routine HIV screening; no adverse effects were detected (R. Redfield, personal communication, 1997). Small published series of travelers have suggested safety and variable efficacy of the 17D yellow fever vaccine in HIV seropositives without severe immunosuppression.580, 581, 582 The immunogenicity of yellow fever vaccination has been noted to be severely reduced, again in the absence of significant adverse events, in HIV-infected children in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire583 (T. Tsai, personal communication, 1997). WHO recommendations are to use yellow fever vaccine in HIV-seropositive patients who are asymptomatic. It remains a part of the WHO EPI.443 Pending further studies, yellow fever vaccine is not recommended for symptomatic HIV-infected patients by WHO.443 The ACIP recommends that HIV-infected people without AIDS or other symptomatic manifestations of HIV infection, who have laboratory-established verification of adequate immune function, and who cannot avoid potential exposure to yellow fever be offered the choice of vaccination.584 Given apparent reduced vaccination efficiency, neutralizing antibody titers should probably be measured prior to travel. If travel requirements (as opposed to actual risk of infection) are the only reason for vaccination of an asymptomatic HIV-infected person, a vaccination waiver letter (which may not be accepted at some borders) should be obtained.584 For all travelers, avoidance of areas of transmission and, if travel to such areas is essential, conscientiously avoiding mosquito exposure is prudent.",

In these reports, giant cell pneumonitis has been the principal complication and the prime cause of death, although fatal subacute measles encephalitis has also been described. CD4+ T-cell counts have not been reported in many of these cases, but where they have been reported they have generally been less than 500/\u03bcL. Such case reports and series are obviously likely to be biased toward the severe end of the spectrum of disease, however. Three substantial studies have investigated HIV\u2013measles coinfection in sub-Saharan Africa.600, 601, 602 A study of children hospitalized with measles in Kinshasa showed similar mortality rates among HIV-seropositive (31.3%) and -seronegative (28%) children.600 The fact that only severely ill patients, with complications, were hospitalized likely obviated the ability to detect differential mortality in this study. An initial study of children with measles in Lusaka revealed a significantly higher mortality rate in HIV seropositives (28%) than seronegatives (8.3%).601 A second prospective study in hospitalized children in Lusaka that distinguished between HIV infection and HIV seropositivity found few differences in the clinical presentation, complications, or mortality of HIV-infected compared to -uninfected children with measles.602 However, enrollment was based on a clinical diagnosis of measles, which would be expected to minimize the ability to detect differences in clinical presentation; there was a bias against enrollment of critically ill children and those dying soon after admission; and there was significantly greater mortality among HIV-infected compared with -uninfected children among those with clinically diagnosed as opposed to confirmed measles.602 Early death prior to mounting diagnostic measles IgM titers in the face of severe immunosuppression was suspected to be confounding. Other positive findings in this study included a higher proportion of HIV infection among children hospitalized with measles than expected from (maternal) population prevalence rates, a greater proportion of coinfected patients hospitalized with measles younger than the age of 9 months, and a longer duration of illness before hospitalization and longer hospitalization in coinfected children.602 Follow-up studies have shown that coinfected patients have a higher risk (90.9% vs. 52.8%) for prolonged (30 to 61 days after rash onset) shedding of measles virus603; and that in vivo HIV replication appears to be suppressed during acute measles.604\n",

In general, there is a strong correlation between levels of neutralizing antibody and protection, but the failure of postexposure prophylaxis with immune serum globulin in preventing fatal giant cell pneumonia in patients with the cellular immunodeficiencies noted previously provides compelling evidence that CMI mechanisms, whether specific or nonspecific, are important even in protection from initial infection. In adults with HIV infection, there appears to be no waning of measles antibody titers with increasing immunosuppression.611, 612, 613 Unfortunately, there are no clear data on the response to vaccination in those adults who lack antibodies to measles.614 In children, the situation is different. HIV-infected infants have a markedly lower rate of seroconversion after measles vaccination, generate lower titers of antibody on seroconversion, and have a high rate of secondary vaccine failure, with antibody titers that decrease with time and with increasing immunosuppression.615 Variable, but generally poor, responses to second doses of vaccine have been reported.615\n",

Although the use of measles vaccine had appeared to be quite safe in HIV-infected children and adults,619 two reports have emphasized the need for some caution. A 20-year-old man with no HIV-related symptoms but a CD4+ T-cell count \u201ctoo few to enumerate\u201d received a second dose of measles vaccine prior to entry into college. One year after vaccination, he developed progressive, vaccine-associated measles pneumonitis.620 A study of the effect of HIV on measles mortality in 356 children hospitalized with measles in Lusaka, Zambia, is also troubling.601 Previous studies have suggested that when prior measles vaccination does not prevent disease, it can reduce the severity of infection.600 In HIV-seronegative boys hospitalized for measles, prior measles vaccination did lead to a significantly lower case fatality rate.601 Although case fatality rates were not significantly lower in vaccinated HIV-seropositive boys or HIV-seronegative girls than in their unvaccinated controls, there was a trend toward a lower case fatality rate in the vaccinees. Surprisingly, however, the case fatality rate was higher in measles-vaccinated than in unvaccinated HIV-seropositive girls. Although this did not reach statistical significance, it is reminiscent of the experience with the high-titered Edmonston\u2013Zagreb (EZ) vaccine. Use of high-titered EZ vaccine at less than 9 months of age was associated with a delayed excess mortality in several study sites.621, 622, 623 This occurred exclusively in female infants for reasons that remain unclear. It is notable that in the Zambian study noted previously, the highest mortality was seen in the youngest, vaccinated HIV-seropositive girls. However, in regions where there is measles transmission, risk\u2013benefit analysis clearly favors measles immunization of all children regardless of HIV status.615 In regions where measles transmission does not occur and where immune status can be monitored, withholding of measles vaccine from HIV-infected children with severe immune compromise is wise.615 WHO recommends measles vaccination for all children in developing countries regardless of HIV infection or symptom status because of the high risk and severity of measles in general in such countries.443,\n624\n",

Data suggest that this utility may be lessened by the presence of HIV infection. Both relative and absolute eosinophilia occur for nonparasitic reasons with considerable frequency in HIV-infected populations. A relative eosinophilia commonly occurs with progressive HIV disease, at least in North American adult AIDS patients,684,\n685 due to a sparing of absolute blood eosinophil concentrations in the face of decreasing concentrations of all other granulocytic and mononuclear leukocyte populations.685 This effect becomes marked with CD4+ T-cell counts less than 200/\u03bcL.685 Nonhelminth-related absolute eosinophilia also occurs with regularity with advancing HIV disease. Absolute eosinophilia in North American HIV-seropositive adults has most frequently been associated with pruritic cutaneous disease, particularly the diagnoses of eosinophilic pustular folliculitis, atopic dermatitis, and prurigo nodularis.686 Most such patients have CD4 counts less than 100/\u03bcL.686 It remains unclear in these patients whether the eosinophilia is primary with secondary cutaneous manifestations or an allergic response to a predominantly cutaneous antigen. A few AIDS patients have presented with what appears to be a variant of the hypereosinophilic syndrome with prominent cutaneous manifestations687,\n688 or a hyper-IgE-like syndrome.689 Rare causes of tissue or blood eosinophilia in AIDS patients have included acute eosinophilic pneumonia690 and high-grade B-cell lymphomas.691 Adverse reactions to various prophylactic and therapeutic agents may also elicit eosinophilia in AIDS patients. Other causes of secondary blood eosinophilia appear to be quite uncommon in North American AIDS patients.691 This includes adrenal insufficiency, despite the high prevalence of adrenalitis at autopsy in AIDS patients.692 The upshot of these reports is that the diagnostic specificity of blood eosinophilia for tissue helminthic infection is probably poorer in HIV-infected than in HIV-free adult patients in the industrial north (a conclusion somewhat undermined by the low population prevalence of helminthic disease in the studies cited previously). It is probably reasonable, however, to avoid an extensive workup for parasitic and other causes of eosinophilia in adult eosinophilic AIDS patients with cutaneous disease from the industrial world; however, in populations at higher risk of helminthiasis, such a conclusion is unwarranted in the absence of prospective studies of eosinophil levels in AIDS patients with tissue helminthiasis.693 Such eosinophilia with advancing HIV disease has not been noted in children in the industrial world.694,\n695\n",

Immune reconstitution was accompanied by the development of robust eosinophila (1500/\u03bcL) that decreased with praziquantel treatment.

Primary prophylaxis was also addressed through review of the recommendations for routine immunization schedules in HIV-infected children. In addition to standard schedules for immunization against HBV, HAV, polio, H. influenzae type b, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertusis, altered schedules for vaccination against S. pneumoniae (use of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine beginning at 2 months, followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at 2 years), influenza (yearly dose recommended), MMR (no administration to severely immunosuppressed children), and VZV (administration only to asymptomatic, nonimmunosuppressed children) were reviewed. Recommendations for secondary prophylaxis were similar to recommendations for adults, with the addition of a recommendation for use of TMP\u2013SMX or IVIG to prevent invasive bacterial infection in the presence of more than two such infections in a 1-year period.213\n",

The applicability to much of the tropics is less clear, however, given differing spectra of OIs, differences in antibiotic resistance patterns, and differences in sociocultural acceptability or feasibility of preventive measures. Limits in the availability of health-care resources (including not just an inability to support the cost of many prevention regimens but also an inability to diagnose HIV disease early enough for preventive measures to be effective, to reliably stage the degree of HIV-associated immunosuppression, and to definitively diagnose OIs) also directly influence the range of prevention options and priorities. It should also be noted that compared with HAART therapy (or prevention of HIV infection), the benefit of OI prevention in reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality may be somewhat modest.702 Adequate global provision of HAART represents an ongoing, immense challenge, however, and wide implementation of simple, cheap, effective OI prevention strategies provides an opportunity to rapidly and widely reduce morbidity and mortality.675 The wide availability of affordable and effective regimens may also encourage people to seek HIV testing.675\n",

Because possession of HAART medications may reveal the traveler's HIV infection, a potential solution is to remove or cover drug labels. Clearly, this is not without its own risks, which demand that careful records (medication names, dosages, frequencies, and physical appearance) be kept in more than one safe place by the traveler. Finally, there is the problem of untoward drug interactions with protease inhibitors. When initial HIV infection diagnosis and/or staging occurs during pretravel evaluation, the traveler may be newly recognized to fall into a group for whom HAART therapy is recommended. For those planning short-term travel, initiation of HAART just prior to departure is probably unwise due to the risk of developing significant side effects\u2014many of which tend to be worse with initiation of therapy and some of which are intensified by stress\u2014in the absence of close contact with a knowledgeable provider. For those in this situation who are planning long-term residence in the tropics, departure should probably be postponed until the traveler is stably on HAART therapy, unless close, timely follow-up can be achieved in the destination country. A critical variable, as ever in the rapidly changing field of HIV clinical care, is adequate, ongoing experience. Travel physicians without extensive, current experience in the care of those with HIV/AIDS should be in close consultative contact with physicians who possess this expertise: Today's verities rapidly become out of date. Textbooks of HIV care with frequent Web-based updates are also valuable resources.76,\n77\n",

In addition to the fact that many tropical travel-associated enteric bacterial infections are more severe in the presence of HIV coinfection, the achlorhydria that occurs in AIDS may markedly lower the amount of inoculum needed for the establishment of infection.566,\n567 Precautions recommended for all travelers should be followed assiduously. Foods and beverages may be contaminated, particularly raw, unpeeled fruits and vegetables; raw or undercooked eggs; meats; seafood; tap water; ice; unpasteurized dairy products (beware of soft cheeses); and food purchased from street vendors.213 Steaming hot foods, meat cooked until brown throughout, water brought to a boil for 1 minute, bottled (especially carbonated) beverages, very hot beverages, beer and wine, and fruits and vegetables peeled by the traveler are generally safe.213 In addition to preventing enteric disease, following these precautions will also lower the risk of infection with T. gondii. Treating water with iodine or chlorine may be done, preferably in conjunction with filtration, when boiling is not practical. Filtration of water, using reverse osmosis or sub 1 micron filters, is efficacious in removing Cryptosporidia from water.716 All tap water should be avoided, even small amounts used for brushing teeth. Recreational water exposure also carries a risk. Obviously, fecally contaminated water should be avoided altogether. Swallowing water while swimming should be avoided.213 Direct contact with soil and sand should be avoided in places where fecal contamination is likely; hands should be washed frequently. Antimicrobial prophylaxis for enteric pathogens is not routinely recommended for HIV-uninfected travelers. For HIV-infected travelers, such prophylaxis may be considered, however, depending on the level of immunosuppression, the risk of infection, and the duration of travel.213 Fluoroquinolones are probably the drugs of choice. All HIV-infected travelers should carry antimicrobials (with or without antimotility agents) for an empirical treatment course in case diarrhea develops. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for 3 to 7 days is a reasonable choice. Alternatives such as TMP\u2013SMX or azithromycin should be used for children and pregnant women. Medical attention should quickly be sought if empirical therapy fails, if shaking chills or hematochezia occur, or if dehydration develops.213\n",
