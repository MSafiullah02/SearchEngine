This trimeric complex homodimerizes, leading to receptor activation.11 44 Expression of the membrane-bound form of IL-6R is largely restricted to hepatocytes, megakaryocytes and leukocytes,45 yet two independent pathways generate a soluble form of the receptor: cleavage by membrane metalloproteinases, primarily ADAM10 and ADAM17, as well as alternative splicing.45\u201347 Soluble IL-6/IL-6R receptor complex can also bind gp130, activating the downstream signaling cascade. The ubiquitous expression of gp130, which has been detected in all human tissues examined, underlies the pleiotropic effects of IL-6, and the near universal responsiveness to the cytokine across cell types. Receptor activation through the membrane-bound IL-6R versus the soluble form of IL-6R are referred to as classical and trans signaling, respectively. Generally, classical signaling contributes to regenerative and anti-inflammatory responses, whereas trans signaling is pro-inflammatory and plays a role in causing tissue damage.",

Antibodies such as tocilizumab, sarilumab and siltuximab inhibit IL-6 signaling by antagonizing ligand-receptor engagement, whereas Jakinibs prevent the downstream signaling cascade. The intracellular domain of gp130 is constitutively associated with the Janus family tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2. On homodimerization, JAKs autophosphorylate and JAK1 phosphorylates 5 tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of gp130, leading to the activation of multiple intracellular signaling cascades. Recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT3 initiates its homodimerization and nuclear trafficking, initiating a transcriptional program associated with proliferation, differentiation, recruitment, survival and transformation in T and B cells and myeloid cells. A negative feedback loop modulates activation of the IL-6-JAK/STAT cascade, as STAT3 upregulates SOCS1 and SOCS3, which directly inhibits the catalytic activity of JAK by binding to phosphorylated gp130 at tyrosine 759, and stops JAK activation through direct binding.11 Phosphorylated gp130 is also a binding site for SH2 domain tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), activating a cascade involving RAS, RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), which culminates in the activation of various transcription factors involved in increasing cell growth, antibody synthesis and acute phase protein generation. JAK also phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is then phosphorylated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to become phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which then phosphorylates PkB/Akt serine/threonine kinase to modulate expression of several genes involved in cellular survival.12\n",
