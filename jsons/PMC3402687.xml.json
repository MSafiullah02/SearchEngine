            "text": "Ebolavirus is a non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus of the Filoviridae family that is associated with outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates in sub-Saharan Africa. Ebolavirus infects a wide range of cell types during an infection, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and hepatocytes. Entry into cells is mediated through the viral glycoprotein (GP), but the process is poorly characterized. Recent studies suggest that the virion enters the cell through macropinocytosis (Hunt et al., 2010, Nanbo et al., 2010, Saeed et al., 2010). Although the trigger for this uptake is not known, several host factors have been identified that could be involved in this step (Hunt et al., 2010, Kondratowicz et al., 2011). Once in the endosome, the virion encounters the cysteine proteases Cathepsin B (CatB) and Cathepsin L (CatL). These proteases cleave GP within a disordered loop (Chandran et al., 2005, Kaletsky et al., 2007, Schornberg et al., 2006). Although this cleavage appears to be necessary for entry, it is not sufficient to induce viral fusion with the host membrane. A subsequent step requiring cathepsins is also necessary (Kaletsky et al., 2007, Schornberg et al., 2006). The substrate of this second cathepsin cleavage has not been defined. Recently, Niemann\u2013Pick Type C1 (NPC1) was identified as a host protein important for entry of Ebola virus (Carette et al., 2011, Cote et al., 2011). NPC1 is thought to interact with the processed form of GP (Cote et al., 2011), but a mechanism of action has not been determined.",

Several different screening strategies have been used in the past to identify host factors involved in entry, with varying success. Chinese Hamster Ovary K1 (CHO-K1) cells are a functionally haploid cell line that is naturally genetically diverse. For decades, these properties of CHO-K1 cells have been exploited to isolate variants with alterations in specific processes, such as diphtheria intoxication (Moehring and Moehring, 1977). Such variants were subsequently used to elucidate the mechanism of the given process being studied.",

The cell lines were analyzed for defects in established host factors involved in ebolavirus entry, and all four were found to have a defect in expression of NPC1. Exogenous expression of NPC1 restored susceptibility to infection in all four clones. Additionally, overexpression of several other purported ebolavirus entry factors did not overcome a defect in NPC1. Although NPC1 is not expressed in any of these clones, the mutations leading to this loss of expression are unique in each clone. The fact that we isolated multiple clones with distinct, natural mutations in the NPC1 gene lends weight to the recent evidence suggesting that NPC1 is a key host factor necessary for entry of ebolavirus.",

Infection of unmutagenized CHO cells with VSV EboGP mCherry at an MOI of 8 produced numerous colonies. In contrast, infection with VSV-GFP, a VSV vector expressing its own glycoprotein and a GFP marker, did not produce any viable colonies. This observation suggests that there is a high level of natural resistance to ebolaviral entry in CHO cells. After expansion, colonies were pooled and cloned by limiting dilution. Clonal cell lines were tested for susceptibility to VSV EboGP mCherry and VSV GFP. Four clonal cell lines (R1, R2, R4, and L2) that displayed complete resistance to VSV EboGP mCherry, while maintaining susceptibility to VSV GFP, were chosen for further characterization. These four cell lines were derived from resistant colonies isolated from separate plates challenged with VSV EboGP mCherry. The R2 and L2 cell lines display a similar morphology to wildtype (WT) CHO-K1 cells while R1 cells are much larger than WT cells with a more fibroblast-like appearance, and the R4 cells are larger and rounder than the CHO-K1 parent.",

Infection of WT CHO-K1 cells with VSV EboGP mCherry produces a similar pattern. In contrast, for the R1, R2, R4, and L2 cell lines neither expression of the mCherry marker nor the cytopathic effects of VSV replication is seen with either high or low MOIs of VSV EboGP mCherry at any time point up to 48 h post-infection. Given the rapid kinetics of VSV replication in these cells, even low levels of infection would be apparent by 48 h. A more quantitative analysis using flow cytometry demonstrates that all four cell lines are effectively infected with VSV GFP (Fig. 1b). On the contrary, while an average of 33% of WT CHO-K1 cells express mCherry 12 h after challenge with VSV EboGP mCherry, less than 0.2% of R1, R2, R4, and L2 cells express mCherry (Fig. 1b).

All four resistant clones had similar levels of transduction with HIV/VSV G as WT CHO-K1 cells, as determined by the percent of cells expressing GFP (\nFig. 2a). In contrast, while on average approximately 26% of WT CHO-K1 cells expressed GFP following transduction with HIV/ZEBOV GP, less than 2% of the resistant cells were transduced. This represents less than ten percent of the level of transduction of WT CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 2a). A similar result was seen when the resistant cells were challenged with HIV pseudotypes bearing Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) GP, Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV) GP, or Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) GP (Fig. 2b).

Chinese hamster cells lack functional surface receptors for SARS-CoV. Accordingly, the ebolavirus-resistant cell lines were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid for human ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV, 48 h prior to transduction with VSV/SARS S or VSV/ZEBOV GP. Untransfected cells were also challenged with VSV/SARS S as a negative control. R1, R2, R4, and L2 cells expressing ACE2 displayed high levels of luciferase activity following challenge with VSV/SARS S (Fig. 4d). Conversely, as before, these cell lines were refractory to transduction mediated by ebolavirus GP, with only background levels of luciferase activity seen following challenge with VSV/ZEBOV GP. These background luciferase values for the mutant cells lines were not statistically different compared to those seen with VSV/SARS S transduction in the absence of human ACE2. The high level of transduction of all four clones with VSV/SARS S indicates that the endosomal uptake and CatL pathways are intact and do not appear to be the mechanism for resistance of these cell lines.",

Expression of full-length NPC1 is readily evident by Western blot analysis of WT CHO-K1 cells (\nFig. 6b) whereas no expression is seen in the four ebolavirus-resistant cell lines. To determine the basis for the loss of expression of NPC1 in the resistant cells we performed RT-PCR on total cellular RNA. Sequence analysis of the cDNA for three of the clones, R1, R2, and L2, reveals that they contain unique frameshift mutations in the NPC1 gene. The R1 cell line encodes an 8-nucleotide (nt) duplication in exon 12, starting at nt 1832 and resulting in a truncated protein predicted to be 624 amino acids long. The R2 cell line contains an 874-nt insertion in exon 8 flanked by a 3-nt repeat (see Fig. 6a). This insert results in a predicted 466 aa product. L2 contains a substitution (P98S) in exon 4 and a 20-nt deletion in exon 6. The deletion results in a truncation of the protein after NPC1 residue number 225. RT-PCR analysis using several sets of primers failed to detect an intact transcript encoding NPC1 in the R4 cell line, suggesting there is a large deletion or major rearrangement of the locus in these cells.",

Hygromycin B selected cells were used for protein analysis by Western blot or challenged with VSV EboGP mCherry and analyzed by flow cytometry. Varying, but readily detectable, levels of NPC1 were seen in all of the Hygromycin selected cell lines (Fig. 6b). In all cases, stable expression of NPC1 was able to at least partially restore susceptibility to ebolavirus GP-mediated infection (Fig. 6c). The transduced R1, R2, and L2 cell lines were infected by VSV EboGP mCherry at roughly 49\u201360% that of WT cells (Fig. 6c). While the restoration of susceptibility was less efficient in the R4 line, with an average infection level of about 19% of WT, this level was still approximately100-fold above that seen without NPC1 expression. A similar trend with the R4 clone showing the lowest degree of restoration was seen when the cells transiently expressed NPC1 (data not shown). By comparison, stable expression of NPC1 in M12 cells, a CHO cell line carrying a deletion of the NPC1 locus (Millard et al., 2000), resulted in \u223c40% level of infection in WT cells.

Overexpression of these proteins in our resistant cell lines did not restore susceptibility, suggesting that the R1, R2, R4, and L2 cells do not have a defect in either of these genes. Recent evidence demonstrates that Axl can facilitate entry of some viruses by a Gas6/phosphatidylserine mediated mechanism resembling apoptotic body uptake, and this process is most evident when a primary entry pathway is disrupted or impaired (Morizono et al., 2011). Axl can also provide an alternative entry pathway for Lassa virus in cells deficient for the primary receptor \u03b1-dystroglycan by a process that does not require Gas6 (Shimojima et al., 2012). Our results indicate that Axl overexpression does not provide an alternative means of entry into NPC1 deficient, ebolavirus-resistant mutant CHO-K1 cell lines.",

Defects in host proteins involved in any of these steps could potentially confer cellular resistance to infection. Consequently, the relatively unbiased selection method employed here could result in isolation of mutants with defects in several different genes, as was seen with a similar screen looking at diphtheria toxin resistance (Moehring and Moehring, 1977). However, all four of the independently isolated ebolavirus GP-resistant CHO cell lines contained mutations in the same gene, NPC1. Although all of the resistant cell lines characterized had mutations in NPC1, the mutations were all unique, indicating that they arose from discrete events. Furthermore, exogenous expression of NPC1 restored susceptibility of the resistant cells, indicating that the loss of expression of NPC1 was sufficient to render these cells resistant. It is possible that these resistant cell lines could have an additional defect in another gene. However, given the high level of restoration seen with exogenous expression of NPC1, any such mutation is likely to only play a minor role, if any, in susceptibility to entry.",

Carette et al. used an insertional mutagenesis approach to identify cells resistant to infection by ebolavirus GP. Although they utilized a recombinant VSV-EboGP vector similar to the one employed here, the insertional mutagenesis strategy employed could have biased the results toward NPC1 because of the large target size (>55 kilobases) of the NPC1 gene. Similarly, the studies by Cote and colleagues used a compound library screen to identify NPC1, and thus were biased toward \u201cdruggable\u201d targets. Our findings, using a selection strategy with a bias for naturally occurring mutations, also identified NPC1 in multiple ebolavirus-resistant cell lines. Despite performing a selection screen with VSV-EboGP using four independent pools of CHO-K1 cells, and in contrast to the selection screen of Carette et al. (2011), the current studies did not identify any other targets of ebolavirus entry aside from NPC1. The fact that our screen did not identify the HOPS (hemolytic fusion and protein sorting) endosomal sorting complex proteins found by Carette et al. (2011) may suggest that CHO cells with defects in these genes are rare or that the screen was not saturating. Taken as a whole, three strategies, each with a different selection bias, identified the same host factor, confirming the critical role of NPC1 in Ebola entry.",

Mutational analysis of NPC1 in human patients has revealed over 100 different alterations, widely distributed throughout the gene, which affect cholesterol regulatory function (Carstea et al., 1997, Garver and Heidenreich, 2002). The majority are missense mutations, several of which result in essentially normal amounts of NPC1 protein but impair cholesterol control (Millat et al., 2001, Ribeiro et al., 2001). Missense and deletion mutations that affect NPC1 localization to the late endosome have also been identified (Blom et al., 2003). However, in our studies all of the CHO mutants selected for resistance to ebolavirus GP abrogated NPC1 protein expression. This suggests that simple mutations that impair the cholesterol regulatory function of NPC1 do not cripple the protein's role in ebolaviral entry.",
