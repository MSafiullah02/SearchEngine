In this scenario, more and more social interactions move online, especially on social media like Twitter and Weibo. People post tweets to share information, express opinions and seek help during the pandemic, and these tweets on social media are valuable for studies against COVID-19, such as disease surveillance. Therefore, in this paper, we release Weibo-COV 1 , a first largescale COVID-19 social media dataset from Weibo, covering more than 30 million tweets from 1 November 2019 to 30 April 2020. Moreover, the field information of the dataset is very rich, including basic tweets information, interactive information, location information and retweet network. We hope this dataset can promote studies of COVID-19 from multiple perspectives and enable better and faster researches to combat the spread of this disease.",

Specifically, unlike the conventional API or advanced searching method to retrieve data, which limit large data access, we first build a high-qulity Weibo active user pool with 20 million users from over 250 general users, then collect all active users' tweets during the time period and filter out tweets related to COVID-19 by our selected 179 keywords.

We hope this dataset can promote studies of COVID-19 from multiple perspectives and enable better and faster researches to combat the spread of this disease. At present, given specified keywords and a specified period, we have two methods for constructing Weibo public opinion datasets: (1) Based on advanced search interface of Weibo, however, due to the limitation of the Weibo search interface, we can only obtain up to 1,000 tweets with a specified keyword and a specified period, making it difficult to build large-scale datasets.",
