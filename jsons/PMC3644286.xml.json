Although there are numerous reports in the literature describing various interventions designed to mitigate ED and hospital crowding due to infectious respiratory disease outbreaks, it is difficult to compare the impact of interventions across sites due to lack of standardized outcome measures, as well as variability in medical center structure, patient populations, and the particular characteristics and dynamics of an individual outbreak.11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14 Furthermore, medical centers tend to implement multiple responses during an outbreak to help control both short and long-term patient surges, further complicating attempts to independently and accurately evaluate the impact of any individual intervention on the outcomes of interest, namely maintaining timely care within the ED and hospital.",

For example, outbreaks can manifest as high or low severity of illness, and high or low levels of contagion, which ultimately contributes to the volume of patients seeking care. Hence, it is unclear if a single set of preparedness protocols would address varying types of outbreaks with differential volume of patients and severity of illness. Given the inherent difficulty of analyzing the published literature, and lack of differentiation in the operational approach to the various types of major emerging infectious outbreaks, it is necessary to approach this problem through a mixed methods approach.",

Of the 66 panelists invited, 34 (52%) attended the one day conference and were offered financial reimbursed for basic travel expenses only. To ensure appropriate representation, participants were selected from all key geographic areas of the U.S., and if a representative of a directly related governmental organization was unable to attend, they were asked to select a replacement to represent that organization. The panelists represented the fields of public health (8), disease surveillance (15), clinical medicine (13), emergency medicine operations (8), hospital operations (6), and systems experts (7), with some panelists representing more than one field. Representatives included those from the federal organizations (2), state and city health departments (6), corporate and non-profit organizations (2), and academic institutions (24).

Communication and coordination between all of these stakeholders increases the breadth of potential response options, and the overall effectiveness. Beyond the individual responses, these same organizations, with appropriate and timely sharing of data, combined with current surveillance systems, can inform the timing of when to implement the appropriate response.

Other highly ranked ED interventions were simple precautionary measures to protect non-ILI patients from being infected, such as hand sanitizers, masks, and cohorting infected patients, which are likely to have a delayed impact on ED crowding. Placing these highly rated interventions in the context of the often used ED crowding model of input, throughput and output, the majority of highly rated interventions focused on ED input, or reducing the number of patients presenting to the emergency department.21 Conversely, the majority of interventions presented in the peer-reviewed literature focus on interventions to impact ED throughput, or the speed at which ED patients are managed.22 Most of the literature evaluating the impact of interventions evaluates the combined impact of multiple interventions, making it difficult to isolate the effect of a single intervention. To our knowledge, only one paper isolates an ED input intervention showing that an ED vaccination campaign reduces ED visits for respiratory illness by 34%.23 Despite this evidence, this particular input intervention (ED vaccination) was rated lower by this expert panel, suggesting that cost and ease of implementation were important factors considered by the panel.",
