The high proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation alerted us to the ease at which an outbreak could overwhelm our critical care resources if we do not develop adequate surge capacity.

Because most patients with ALI or ARDS do not die of refractory hypoxemia, this low tidal volume strategy likely improves outcome by reducing the systemic inflammatory response produced by ventilator-induced lung injury [16]. As the clinical and pathologic manifestations of SARS and AI H5N1 are indistinguishable from other causes of ALI or ARDS, and the cause of death is similarly refractory systemic inflammation, shock, and multiorgan failure, it seems reasonable that the ventilatory management principles learned in ALI and ARDS should be adopted in an airborne epidemic [9]. Thus, the authors recommend using volume or pressure control ventilation targeting tidal volumes of 6-mL/kg predicted body weight and plateau pressures of less than 30-cm of water. In addition, positive end expiratory pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen are adjusted to maintain a partial pressure of oxygen of 55 mm Hg to 80 mm Hg. Of particular note is the significant incidence of pneumothorax reported in patients with AI H5N1, which may necessitate a cautious approach to lung recruitment maneuvers [17].",

This is an attractive option, especially in a pandemic scenario when the demand for mechanical ventilatory support is overwhelming. However, there are conflicting reports regarding its safety for health care workers [22]. There is worry about dispersion of infectious particles, and an experimental model confirmed substantial exposure to exhaled air occurring within 0.5 meters of patients receiving NIPPV [23]. Nevertheless, there were no reports of nosocomial transmission with adequate respiratory protection during SARS [19]. Patient selection is important for NIPPV, as it has not been shown to improve mortality in ARDS [24], and may not be suitable for patients where near-term improvement is not expected.",

Preparations include stockpiling positive pressure ventilators and medical supplies, adapting general hospital beds for critical care delivery, augmenting and training staff, enhancing infection control measures, and conducting preparedness exercises. To this end, many local, state, and national bodies have developed such stockpiles and disaster management plans.

There is a need to develop triage protocols to prioritize access to limited resources, including mechanical ventilation [34]. Triage criteria should be based on clinical indicators of survivability, and resources allocated to those most likely to benefit. These are difficult decisions and cannot be left until times of crisis. Development of triage protocols should be done in advance, with careful consideration of ethical principles [35]. It is crucial to engage the community in this process so that public trust exists when it is most needed.",

The SARS outbreak exposed the vulnerability of health care workers and highlighted the importance of establishing stringent infection control and crisis management protocols. Patients with ALI or ARDS who require mechanical ventilation should receive a lung protective, low tidal volume strategy. There remains controversy regarding the use of HFOV and NIPPV. Standard, contact and airborne precautions should be instituted in the ICU, with special care taken when aerosol-generating procedures are performed. During an airborne pandemic, the mortality, morbidity, and public confidence are likely to be highly dependent on the critical care response. It is imperative for critical care providers to take the lead in planning and preparing for this eventuality.",
