These infections harm bacteria, fungi, protozoa, plants, and animals. Many of our diseases have their own diseases. Disease is an inescapable feature of human life. Humans can contract communicable diseases from bacteria, fungi, helminthes, protozoa, viruses, and prions. A little biology, my favorite subject, is required to understand how they cause disease, how novel diseases can arise, and why some of them are so difficult to control.",

Schistosomiasis is the most common helminth disease, causing widespread suffering. Initial infection can cause fever, chills, and liver and spleen enlargement. Chronic infections can lead to liver or kidney failure, bladder cancer, heart failure, and other symptoms. This disease is difficult to treat and causes major suffering in the world; at any one time, over 200 million people are infected, mostly in Africa. This disease is a major cause of suffering, but we don\u2019t know enough to eradicate it. We have studied most tropical diseases far less than those influencing populations in wealthier temperate countries. Worldwide cooperation in study of all major diseases is required to decrease the amount of suffering related to helminth diseases.",

The mad cow disease is probably the best known of these diseases. This prion-caused disease arose when meat producers in Europe fed animals neural material (brain and spinal tissues) from other cattle. Cannibalism is not natural for cattle, but the practice arose because it stimulated growth when animals consumed waste by-products from other slaughtered cattle. Some of the sick animals had a protein in their brains that was defective and could infect the brains of other cattle when ingested. If people unknowingly eat beef contaminated with some of this infected neural tissue, they also become infected. The defective protein causes human neural proteins to lose their function slowly over time. People have died from this and related prion diseases.

Evolution to evade human immune defense is why viruses that cause colds move though human populations so readily.

However, archeologists have found evidence for a large crash in American Indian populations across both North and South America after first contact with Europeans; the estimates are 57% mortality.

An effort called Global Viral [30] is also helping move the international community toward predicting viral outbreaks by promoting science and education about viral outbreaks.",

The 1925 Geneva Protocol, the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, the 1976 Environmental Modification Convention, and the 1993 Chemical Convention all strove to have all countries agree to not develop or use chemical or biological weapons [36]. The Obama administration was involved in international efforts to stop the spread of biological weapons to terrorists. The United Nations is developing other treaties. Measures might include careful accounting of the reagents that molecular biologists can use to produce diseases and barring companies from providing DNA or RNA synthesis for particular sequences known to be associated with disease organisms. Careful international monitoring of biological laboratories capable of handling pathogenic microbes is also necessary, as well as protecting the laboratories that hold the deadliest human diseases. All of these require modest cost, but a substantial degree of international cooperation . For example, if even one country allows synthesis of dangerous virus sequences and will sell those to individuals, control elsewhere is pointless.",
