These include the human metapneumovirus [7], several human coronaviruses (e.g. HKU1, SARS) [8], [9], [10], and the human bocaviruses (HBoV1-4) [11], [12], [13]. Since the discovery of HBoV in 2005, it has been frequently detectable worldwide, mainly in the respiratory tracts of young children [14]. HBoV2-4 primarily occur in stool samples, with HBoV2 seemingly associated with gastroenteritis [11]. The prevalence of HBoV in the upper airways ranges from 1.5% to 19%, with frequent high rates of coinfections with other viral agents [12], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. HBoV has been associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children [17], [18], [19], [21], [22], [23], [24]. HBoV DNA also occurs in the nasopharynx, in middle ear fluids, and in serum of children with AOM [15], [25], [26], [27], and HBoV infection may worsen clinical symptoms and prolong the clinical outcome of AOM [25]. Further studies to establish the causative role of HBoV in the development of AOM are, however, necessary.",

Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in particular has been effective in the prevention of upper respiratory tract infections and in reducing the risk of acute RTIs in children attending daycare [30], [31]. In otitis-prone children, a probiotic combination of L. rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, Bifidobacterium breve 99, and Propionibacterium freudenreichii JS was ineffective in reducing AOM recurrence or nasal colonization by bacterial pathogens.

Briefly, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 6-month intervention study between September 2001 and April 2002, originally 269 otitis-prone children (from 9 months to 5.6 years old) consumed daily either one capsule of probiotics (L. rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, B. breve 99, and P. freudenreichii JS) (n\n = 135) or placebo (n\n = 134). NPS samples were collected as described [6], [32], [33] at the scheduled baseline visit in autumn, at the first follow-up visit after 3 months in winter, and at the final visit after 6 months in spring. For the present study, all three NPS samples were available from 152 otitis-prone children (105 in the placebo and 47 in the probiotic group). Parents received advice to avoid days when the child had respiratory symptoms when making scheduled collection visits. Parents had to keep daily diaries, including signs and symptoms of AOM and respiratory infections, such as fever, earache, otorrhoea, rhinitis, cough, sore throat, chest wheezes, or night restlessness, and listing visits to health care authorities, and of the use of any medication.",

The presence of respiratory symptoms in HBoV DNA-positive children we compared to those of HBoV DNA-negative children, with results as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. In addition, logistic regression and GEE analyses allowed study of association between AOM pathogens and the HBoV DNA-positivity. Logistic regression analysis allowed study of any possible effect of probiotic intervention on HBoV. Results are unadjusted (crude) and baseline-adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. GEE analysis allowed inclusion of 3- and 6-month visits simultaneously and baseline positivity was a categorical covariate.",

In otitis-prone children, any increased mucus or abnormal nasopharyngeal structure may favor HBoV persistence. In addition, we identified two children, with HBoV-positive NPS samples taken 6 months apart with a negative sample between. This finding could be attributed to mucosal contamination, differences in mucus secretion, fluctuating virus shedding, or re-infection. It is also likely that HBoV was occurring in the nasopharynx asymptomatic between visits, and may influence the detection of persistence.",

            "text": "Quantitative PCR detection of HBoV offer insight into the clinical impact of HBoV, because HBoV at a high viral load (>10,000 copies/ml) has been associated with RTIs. Below this cutoff, however, HBoV appears often as an innocent bystander or a remnant of past infection [15], [27], [34]. Thus, HBoV PCR positivity in the nasopharynx alone is insufficient to implicate the HBoV pathogenesis in acute RTI [20], [27], [34], [47], [48]. With only HBoV PCR positivity in NPS as the criterion for diagnosis, some cases of acute HBoV infection, evidenced by viremia, serodiagnosis, or both would be missed. Moreover, false diagnoses may ensue, perhaps as a result of persistent HBoV DNA after the primary infection, or of mucosal contamination. Serological testing, coupled with qPCR, could aid in study of trustworthy causal associations between HBoV and respiratory disease [27], [34], [48] In line with this, we confirmed that presence of HBoV DNA in NPS, even at high viral loads, did not associate significantly with respiratory symptoms reported 2 weeks before or after any scheduled sample-collection periods. Children should have visited the centres for sampling when they were healthy; no major respiratory symptoms were thus expected at sampling times. Regarding associations between baseline characteristics and prevalence of HBoV in children during 6 months, number of siblings and type of daycare may have been associated with HBoV prevalence or persistence. Higher number of siblings correlated with a high HBoV prevalence, perhaps because susceptibility to HBoV infection and mucosal contamination may fall when fewer siblings spread the virus.",

Probiotics could serve as alternative therapy to prevent infectious diseases as they balance the microbial equilibrium, enhance mucosal immunity, and compete with other bacterial adhesion sites [50]. In otitis-prone children, combination of probiotics (L. rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosus Lc705, B. breve 99, and P. freudenreichii JS) failed to reduce AOM recurrence or nasal colonization of bacterial pathogens [32]. Nevertheless, probiotic treatment reduced recurrent URTI, which may imply probiotics\u2019 effectiveness against respiratory infections of viral etiology. In particular, the probiotic strain L. rhamnosus GG has been effective in prevention of children's upper respiratory tract infections [30], [31]. Interestingly, we found that probiotic treatment reduced significantly the number of HBoV DNA-positive samples (p\n = 0.039) in 3\u20136 months after intervention, and marginally also the amount of HBoV-positive children. However, as the number of children in our study groups was unequal, further studies are necessary in order to confirm this observation.",
