            "text": "As discussed earlier in this book, there are sea coast cities worldwide that are at risk from floods, storm surges, and extreme weather conditions such as wind-driven high category hurricanes (typhoons, monsoons), or drought and heat waves, plus along Pacific Ocean coasts, earthquakes and tsunamis. A municipality and its public health services have to be prepared to adapt to their preparations to deal with what contemporary experiences and history reveal are the most likely physical hazards and diseases to impact it. The two main preparatives are first to be able to care for the injured during a hazard event at well-staffed and supplied hospitals and medical clinics or field hospitals. The second is to fill the basic needs of affected populations with clean water, food, shelter, toilets, waste collection, and if necessary power restoration. These primary responses will help to reduce the chance of an onset and spread of disease. It is important to activate search and rescue teams help citizens isolated or trapped by the event that did not or could not evacuate such as in the case of extreme weather and flooding. In addition, where there have been deaths, bodies should be recovered and interred as soon as possible in order to prevent sickness that might originate from them. For instances of collapsed structures with people trapped inside, equipment that can move debris and rescue people or recover the deceased is necessary as would be the case for less common strong earthquakes as well as some extreme storm events. What was just described may be a good template to follow, but in reality, many sea coast cities in developing and less developed countries do not have the resources to cope with severe hazards that might impact them. Here, the World Health Organization and developed nations, large and small, have sent in personnel, supplies, and equipment to help an impacted sea coast city (or inland city) in the past and will surely continue to do so in the future.",

            "text": "Disease control after a natural disaster often means initially dealing with diarrheal diseases (dysentery) from the ingestion of contaminated water or food, and lack of sanitation facilities (toilets, hand-washing stations). It may mean dealing with cases of the infectious diseases like cholera (bacterium Vibrio cholera) or typhoid (bacterium Salmonella typhi) that originate from contaminated water or food or from contacts with cholera or typhoid carriers. To prevent a spreading epidemic status means making safe water and food, sanitation and hand-washing posts available. In the case of cholera, an epidemic may be avoided by isolating the cholera carriers and treating them (with hydration and antibiotics) or oral cholera vaccines where the disease is endemic until the threat of spread is under control. During March 15-16, 2019 , the monsoon Idai flood ravaged Beira, Mozambique, a sea coast city of 533,000 people, and tracked inland into areas of Zimbabwe and Malawi flooding them and killing a total of over 1000 people. In Beira, the drinking water supply and the sewage infrastructure were damaged. Cholera cases were diagnosed and the disease spread rapidly with over 4000 cases identified with 7 deaths by the April 9. The WHO assembled more 975,000 doses of cholera vaccine (oral) and starting April 3 delivered more than 487,000 initial doses to Beira citizens and those in other affected populations, but only about 2 weeks after the disease was first diagnosed. A second inoculation 2 weeks later gives full protection from the disease. Adaptation would require vaccine storage stations set up in regions where outbreaks of endemic and other infectious diseases occur so that those that can be controlled by vaccination could be serviced more rapidly than was the case in Mozambique.",

Six principal climate zones (Mediterranean, tropical, arid, temperate, polar, and mountainous) are classified on the basis of average monthly temperature and precipitation. Temperature and precipitation are determined in grand part by latitude, altitude/landform, and the influence of surface and subsurface ocean currents flow paths, location of mountains and their elevations, and seasonal wind directions. The principal zones are a simplification of a 12 zone classification, each with sub-zones (Table 6 .1) [1] . Missing from this classification is a mountainous one because with their masses and elevations they establish their own micro-zones and affect weather patterns of some of the other zones.",

For example, in Southeast Asia, Jakarta, Bangkok, and Ho Chi Minh City, are hot (30 \u00b0C) with higher humidity (75% RH) and have endemic infectious diseases that originate from contaminated water and food, and those that originate from vector-borne carriers. Country reports show that in the endemic infectious group, all live with the threat of bacterial diarrheal diseases, and two cities live with the threat of Hepatitis A and typhoid fever. In the second group, the three cities have exposure to dengue fever and malaria while two are threatened by Japanese encephalitis, and one with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. In Africa, Mombasa, Kenya in East Africa, population 537,000 and Luanda, Angola in West Africa, population 2.5 million, are located relatively close to the equator (4\u00b0 3\u2032S and 8\u00b0 50\u2032S, respectively) and have similar temperatures of 25-3 \u00b0C and 60-65% relative humidity defining their Mediterranean/sub-tropical to hot humid tropical climates. However, unlike the Southeast Asian sea coast cities with similar infectious disease burdens cited above, Mombasa and Luanda infectious disease burdens differ greatly. Mombasa residents are at risk from malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDs and recently from a resurgent occurrence of polio, measles, and kanazaar (parasitic disease Leishmania donovani). Luanda, Angola residents are at risk from yellow fever, malaria, typhoid fever, and Hepatitis A. Mombasa, an important Kenyan port city also serves Uganda, Rwanda, the Eastern region of the DR Congo. This put the Mombasa population at risk of infectious diseases that may be carried from those countries by people or products. This possibility for infectious disease transfer was supported when public health personnel recently identified an Ebola strain in Kenyans who visited West Africa. The West African region had suffered an Ebola epidemic during 2013-2016. The disease likely began in a village of southeast Guinea as a young boy infected by bats (bushmeat) was carried by exposed villagers to its capital and port city Conakry (population 1.8+ million). The Ebola virus was spread by carriers to the Liberian capital and port city Monrovia (population 1 million with 41 doctors), and to the Sierra Leone capital and port city Freetown (population 1+ million). The World Health Organization, medical teams and NGOs from other nations worked to stop the epidemic but only after more than 11,300 died and more than 28,000 were infected and saved. An as-yet unapproved Ebola vaccine was used here and was instrumental in halting the spread of the Ebola virus.",

Public health services staffed with appropriate personnel, supported financially, with medicine stocks plus WHO vaccination stores can be prepared to use them to halt the spread of an infectious disease to prevent an epidemic or to deal with an epidemic that may develop. On August 1, 2018, there was an outbreak of Zaire Ebola virus in North Kivu province of the DR Congo that spread to Ituri Province. In March, 2019, WHO reported that there were more than 1029 cases and 642 deaths. The public health ministry medical experts identified the disease, did contact tracing, contained and treated infected people, and worked to educate the threatened populations of the risk of not reporting Ebola cases, and unsafe burial practices (touching and washing the dead) that is meeting cultural resistance. As important in dealing with the epidemic was the acceptance of the use of the experimental Ebola vaccine that helped stop the spread of the Ebola disease in West Africa a few years earlier. The vaccine was given to 3300 people who had direct or indirect contact with people with the disease. However, the application of the Ebola vaccine and a halt in the rise of infections has been hampered by armed group violence and unsafe burial practices. The disease is recurrent in the DR Congo with ten outbreaks since the discovery of the disease in 1976 [2] . The hope is that it will not become entrenched.",

Vaccinations against infectious diseases keep a nation healthy and productive. A low rate of vaccination in a country or regions for years on end can be damning to its citizens and to people where they travel within that country or internationally. The WHO warns that vaccine hesitancy is one of the top ten global threats of 2019. Vaccination hesitancy can be the result of personal philosophical or religious beliefs that allow parents to opt out of this protection for their children as in the United States where there have been major measles outbreaks in eight states and reported cases in 20 other states. In many of these states legislatures are proposing laws to minimize exemptions to measles vaccination requirements for children of school age. A judge in Brooklyn, New York, following a serious outbreak of measles in children of a religious sect during April, 2019, mandated application of the MMR measles vaccine (including mumps and rubella) to all their children to protect the general public. This was done over the religion leaders objections to vaccinations.",

In a recent deadly outbreak, Madagascar is working to contain a measles epidemic that began in September, 2018 and by February, 2019 had killed more than 900 people (64% children to age 14) and infected more than 68,000 persons. This epidemic is the result of a low immunization rate for many years and has spread throughout the country including Madagascar's most important seaport, Toamasina, and other ports of entry. This, in spite of the fact that a safe and effective vaccine, has been available for the past 50 years but whose application has not been mandated by the national government. Travelers from Madagascar to other countries are potential carriers for about 2 weeks (4 days before a rash appears, plus 6 days during the rash, and for 4 days after the rash disappears).",

If enforcement is applied, it will greatly reduce toxin loading of pollutants into the atmosphere and hence reduce the risk to the health and premature deaths of great numbers of people. This will be effective only if enforcement of laws curbing air pollution is not just an empty threat because of a nation's drive for continued economic development or because of a culture of corruption.",

Water pollution comes as well from toxins in industrial effluents discharged onto land that can runoff into streams and rivers. Rainwater or streams that flow through talus piles of mine wastes can dissolve out heavy metals and carry them overland into waterways. Acid mine drainage from abandoned and functioning operations contaminates streams/rivers into which it discharges. Bacterial pollutants from human wastes where toilets are not used or where the wastes are collected but not treated can pollute waterways as do wastes and agricultural chemicals as runoff from farmland and commercial animal husbandry (e.g., cattle feed lots, chicken production). The toxin runoff, whatever the source(s), affects not only humans but ecosystems and their natural resources that are important to people. Contaminated waters can be cleansed to drinking standards by passing them through a treatment plant before distribution to consumers. Toxin-bearing surface runoff cited above can also seep through a surface cover into aquifers and contaminate groundwater. Under some conditions, groundwater can dissolve heavy metals that may be in aquifer rocks thus polluting water downflow from where the toxic metals originate. As with surface sources of water, polluted groundwater can be treated to remove a heavy metal pollutant or more than one, or other chemicals before being released for human use (drinking, cooking, personal hygiene) or for irrigation of food crops. The sickening of citizens in well-populated sea coast cities from ingestion of pollutants in unsafe drinking (and cooking) water is a grave concern especially in poor neighborhoods that lack access to clean water vs. economically advantaged neighborhoods that receive treated clean water [11] .",

Lead bearing soil dust from vehicular sources has been basically eliminated since the phasing out of leaded gasoline that began in the 1970s and 1980s with the introduction of catalytic converters. However, inherited Pb in soils can be a health hazard. A city may opt to replace a soil, cover it, or otherwise remediate it especially at playgrounds. Cities were early in adapting to the Pb-based paint problem by 1965 recommendations that the amount of Pb in interior and exterior paint be reduced to <50% and subsequently to <0.1% in 1997. The UN and World Bank aim to eliminate its use in 2020. A reasonable recommendation to deal with the millions of homes with Pb-based paint is not to strip it off thus releasing toxic dust and chips to the air and surrounding soil but rather to repaint over it when the paint starts flaking. Lead reduction programs are essential to protect babies and small children who are especially threatened by Pb poisoning if they regularly ingest Pb through drinking water, hand to mouth transfer of contaminated soils, or chewing on flaking paint.

Awareness of the potential problem has resulted in spot checks of rice crops to assure their purity. Scientists are studying how to reduce the bioavailability of Cd in a soil (paddy or not) to growing plants rice grains, by adjusting the pH of the growing medium [18, 19] . Geneticists that have improved micronutrient contents in rice crops and the plant tolerance to pests and herbicides are researching low Cd-accumulating rice cultivars growing in Cd-rich soils. These may reveal a gene that damps Cd uptake. Once identified, genetic engineers can modify receptive rice species that will greatly reduce uptake of soil Cd yet maintain their nutritional values.
