Our study focuses on understanding the responses of potential wetland indicator species, specifically amphibians, to groundwater withdrawal, as indicators are essential to the effective management of wetlands. The composition of amphibian assemblages is influenced by changes in physical conditions of wetlands, such as the alteration of hydrologic regimes (Vickers, Harris & Swindel 1985; Skelly 1996). Alteration of hydrologic regimes by excessive groundwater withdrawal has been shown to affect anurans (Guzy, Campbell & Campbell 2006; Bunnell & Ciraolo 2010), and their responses might be immediately noticeable in some species on a local scale, especially regarding the breeding effort. While calling surveys in a given year may not reflect the actual population size of anurans, which can often survive years of catastrophic reproductive failure (Petranka et al. 2007), they can reflect wetland condition, as reproductive effort is completely dependent on water.",

Excessive withdrawal can lower the surface of the aquifer, which in turn can lower the surficial aquifer and finally the level of inundation in wetlands (Cherry, Stewart & Mann 1970; Stewart 1968; SWFWMD 1999). Many places that have the potential to suffer from excessive groundwater withdrawal have regulations to forestall the problem. In south\u2010western Florida, a large area with thousands of wetlands, the ecological condition of wetlands within all well fields must be assessed annually (SWFWMD 2012), typically using a vegetative health rating (VHR), which incorporates several botanical and physicochemical measurements to rate wetlands according to the level of ecological damage caused by groundwater withdrawal (Gonzalez 2004). Although using a measure of vegetation composition and structure as an indicator of wetland condition is relatively easy, changes in vegetation are gradual (especially for shrubs and trees which may survive several poor years) and thus VHRs are indicators of relatively long\u2010term effects. While changes in amphibian populations can also show long\u2010term effects, amphibian calling activity coupled with the presence of tadpoles and near\u2010metamorphs can give a current measure of wetland condition: disturbed wetlands may not attract breeding adults, and hydrology that is too altered will not sustain larval development through metamorphosis. As the use of groundwater resources increases in many places, a more rapid assessment of wetland condition is required, and anurans may be a valuable suite of indicators. Furthermore, if they are equal or more effective as indicators, anurans could provide an easier, more cost\u2010effective and faster assessment than vegetation; this may be important given rapid human development of certain areas world\u2010wide.",

Although some anurans move relatively long distances (1\u20131\u00b76 km; Lemckert 2004), amphibians in general tend to have poor dispersal abilities (Semlitsch 2000) and dispersal distances typically are <0\u00b73 km (Gibbs 1993; Semlitsch & Bodie 2003). As urban sprawl increases, dispersal corridors are likely to be disrupted, reducing amphibian richness because of increased fragmentation and degradation of wetlands (and the upland matrix between); this restricts the potential for migration among wetlands and limits recolonization of species to wetlands from which they have been extirpated. Thus, wetlands in urban settings have reduced amphibian species richness (e.g. Delis, Mushinsky & McCoy 1996).",

During 2001 and 2002 (Study 1), we monitored 18 (10 \u2018blue\u2019, 5 \u2018green\u2019, and 3 \u2018red\u2019; see below for definition of these VHR ratings) wetlands at Starkey Wellfield (Fig. 1a), to determine whether wetland assessment based on calling activity of anurans was correlated with wetland assessment based on the VHR (Gonzalez 2004; SWFWMD 2012). A VHR rating of \u2018blue\u2019 is assigned to wetlands with vegetation, hydrology and soils indicative of a naturally functioning wetland (i.e. high ecological integrity); of \u2018green\u2019 to wetlands with moderate changes in vegetative composition and zonation, hydrologic indicators, and soil subsidence (\u2018moderately impacted\u2019); and of \u2018red\u2019 to wetlands with severe changes in vegetative composition or zonation, treefall or death, soil oxidation or subsidence, and other biological evidence of hydroperiod reduction (\u2018highly impacted\u2019) (Gonzalez 2004; Fig. 1b\u2013d). A naturally functioning wetland is saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of vegetation adapted to saturated soils (EPA 2012). \u2018Moderate\u2019 vegetative changes occur when transitional species move from edges of a wetland into the deep zone and \u2018severe\u2019 changes occur when upland vegetation moves into the deep zone (SWFWMD 2012). Each wetland was monitored for calling anurans (described below) five to seven times each year, between May and September. Because intensity of calling anurans does not necessarily indicate the quality of wetland habitats for amphibian reproduction, we also sampled tadpoles in a subset of wetlands (5 \u2018blue\u2019, 5 \u2018green\u2019 and 3 \u2018red\u2019) to verify that wetlands had a sufficient hydroperiod to allow recruitment of tadpoles to the terrestrial stage. Each wetland was sampled for tadpoles using D\u2010frame dip nets; up to 20 1\u2010m sweeps were conducted in each microhabitat (vegetation or open water) proportional to the fraction of the total area each microhabitat covered. Passive sampling with traps (60 \u00d7 30 \u00d7 30 cm) was applied at each site with water at least 0\u00b72 m deep. Tadpoles were identified to species and classified in Gosner Stage Categories (Gosner 1960); fish species and invertebrates (potential predators) were also recorded during dip\u2010netting and trapping. Each wetland was monitored for tadpoles six to seven times each year, between July and December.",

We also monitored four wetlands at another site, Green Swamp (Fig. 1a), with no groundwater withdrawal or surrounding urbanization. Each of the 20 wetlands was monitored 10 times each year, between May and September.

Each of the 26 wetlands was monitored for calling anurans approximately one evening every 2 weeks, targeting rainfall events, from the end of May until the middle of September for a total of nine surveys each year.

All species present were listed, water depth was recorded and any differences in species observed were reconciled before leaving the wetland. Calling activity was measured in chorus size categories based on North American Amphibian Monitoring Program (NAAMP 2011) guidelines, but refined to reflect the following six categories of numbers calling males: 1\u201310, 11\u201325, 26\u201350, 51\u2013100, 101\u2013500 and >500. Subsequently, the length of time that each wetland contained surface water (hydroperiod) was determined from water\u2010level data recorded during call surveys, supplemented with data obtained from regulatory agencies. The influence of hydroperiod on amphibian occupancy is well\u2010documented (e.g. Snodgrass et al. 2000; Beja & Alcazar 2003), and highly ephemeral wetlands generally contain species with rapid development and conspicuous feeding, but wetlands with a relatively long hydroperiod contain more established predator populations, and thus slower growing, less conspicuous feeding species utilize these wetlands.",

These variables included (1) distance to nearest study wetland (indication of possible spatial dependence), (2) distance to nearest natural wetland, (3\u20135) per cent forest cover within 500, 1000 and 2000 m, and (6\u20138) mean proximity index (MPX) of forest cover within 500, 1000 and 2000 m; other measured variables included (9) average hydroperiod and (10) water depth at deepest point and (11\u201313) time (month, year or month plus year) as calling activity of anurans is strongly seasonal. One variable, MPX within 500, 1000 and 2000 m of the perimeter of each wetland, reflected the possible importance of urbanization and its consequent fragmentation. MPX assesses not only the amount of forest cover within a specified search radius, but also the distribution from clumped to uniform by measuring the isolation of each forest patch within a complex of forest patches (Gustafson & Parker 1992). Other metrics calculated within the same search radius (e.g. road density, proportion of impervious surfaces) do not take into account the spatial distribution. In our study, a \u2018patch\u2019 is defined as each individual occurrence of a particular land cover type (e.g. forest) in the landscape; the MPX approaches zero if a patch has no neighbours of the same patch type and increases as the neighbourhood is increasingly occupied by patches of the same type and as those patches become closer and more contiguous (or less fragmented) in distribution (Gustafson & Parker 1992). The upper limit of the MPX is affected by the search radius and the minimum distance between patches. Habitat area and isolation affect amphibians, and the degree of importance is a species\u2010specific property reflecting a combination of life\u2010history and behavioural characteristics (Cushman 2006).",

Large MPX values represent large forest patches close together, and small MPX values represent small, widely distributed forest patches. Buffer zones were chosen based on potential amphibian dispersal distances (e.g. Semlitsch & Bodie 2003; Lemckert 2004). We used fragstats, V 3.3 (McGarigal & Marks 1995) to calculate MPX. To determine whether calling anurans (calling male index data and average number of species) were selecting wetlands with sufficient hydroperiod length, we used linear regression with statistica 7.1 (StatSoft 2005) to predict tadpole response (number of species and individuals). We examined calling index data gathered during Studies 1 and 2 for patterns of species\u2019 co\u2010occurrence. Groupings of species (using average calling index) and wetlands were identified with two\u2010way cluster analysis, as implemented in pcord, v 5 (McCune & Mefford 1999). The Bray\u2013Curtis Index was used as the distance measure, and the group average method was used for linking groups. To test whether resulting groups of species and wetlands (not identified a priori) were significantly different from each other in multivariate patterns of co\u2010occurrence across wetlands, we used the SIMPROF routine in primer, v 6 (Clarke & Gorley 2006). Co\u2010occurrence patterns for individual species and also the relationship between individual species and VHR rating were identified by calculating Spearman rank correlations in statistica 7.1 (StatSoft 2005).",

Thus, when detection probabilities are less than one, the true proportion of wetlands occupied should be estimated (e.g. MacKenzie & Kendall 2002). We used a single season mark\u2013recapture\u2010like approach (MacKenzie et al. 2002), as implemented in presence, v 3.1 (Hines 2006), to estimate true proportion of sites occupied by each species for Study 3. We modelled detection probability and site occupancy as a function of different covariates according to the methods described by MacKenzie et al. (2002). Because collinearity between predictor variables can confound their independent effects, we calculated Spearman rank correlation coefficients for all pairwise combinations of independent variables (Hair et al. 1998); five of the 13 exploratory habitat variables (MPX, hydroperiod, water depth, time and distance to next study wetland) had correlation coefficients ranging between \u22120\u00b704 and 0\u00b731, with P\u2010values above 0\u00b705, and were included individually in subsequent modelling. The remaining inter\u2010correlated variables were eliminated. Because MPX was strongly correlated between each buffer zone, we chose MPX at the 500\u2010m buffer for subsequent modelling as the more biologically relevant variable when considering typical dispersal distances for most anurans. The resulting set of candidate models for each species were composed of one covariate each: (1) MPX within 500 m of the wetland, (2) distance to next study wetland, (3) average hydroperiod (each site specific predictors of occupancy), (4) water depth (survey specific predictor of detection) and (5\u20137) time\u2010specific effects on detection (month, year or month plus year) for each species. Model selection was based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), which was adjusted for overdispersion and small sample sizes (i.e. QAICc) (MacKenzie & Bailey 2004). We computed delta QAICc and Akaike weights to determine the strength of evidence for each model (Burnham & Anderson 2002). Because it was impractical to summarize AIC results for all possible models for each species, we present the top 3\u20134 models and weights to gauge importance of each factor for each species. All continuous variables were standardized (i.e. the mean was subtracted from each value and then divided by the SD) before analysis.",

Group 2 is composed of six species: the southern toad Anaxyrus terrestris, squirrel treefrog Hyla squirella, green treefrog Hyla cinerea, eastern narrow\u2010mouthed toad Gastrophryne carolinensis, pig frog Lithobates grylio and southern leopard frog Lithobates sphenocephalus. All six species in the group also positively co\u2010occurred (r\nS = 0\u00b746\u20130\u00b756, all P\u2010values \u22640\u00b705). The remaining four species (southern chorus frog Pseudacris nigrita, greenhouse frog Eleutherodactylus planirostris, gopher frog Lithobates capito and bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus) had limited occurrences and are not considered further.

Coincidentally, these \u2018healthy\u2019 wetlands supported the greatest species richness of anurans and were the only wetlands supporting the entire suite of species in the group. Because the intensity of calling anurans does not necessarily indicate the quality of wetland habitats for amphibian reproduction, we verified that these same wetlands had hydroperiods long enough to support tadpole development and found that the presence of late\u2010stage tadpoles was strongly related to calling index.

In addition, adults may be in wetlands for a short time; however, their reproductive windows are well\u2010established, generally easily targeted, and occupancy statistics can accommodate imperfect detection. Common problems that occur when using both vegetation and amphibians as indicators include misidentification and difficulties identifying dormant\u2010season vegetation and anuran larvae. Wetland plants have many characteristics suited to assessments of biological condition, including their relative immobility, well\u2010developed sampling protocols and, for herbaceous species, moderate sensitivity to disturbance (Doherty et al. 2000). However, wetland plants are unreliable as sole indicators of change in hydrologic regime (Tiner 1991), and soil biogeochemistry should be used with vegetation to minimize lag times in plant response to hydrologic alteration; this is often cost prohibitive. Therefore, amphibians can be used as indicators to supplement ongoing vegetative and hydroperiod monitoring to provide a rapid response measure.",

To ensure the effects of urbanization could be separated from those of excessive groundwater withdrawal, we carefully selected our study wetlands so the two variables were not correlated. Occupancy modelling of a diverse set of wetlands indicated that species considered sensitive to wetland degradation also were highly responsive to the MPX of land within a 500 m buffer surrounding a wetland. For all wetlands, land cover within 500\u20132000 m was a mix of urban (including highways, roads, housing developments, and commercial and industrial areas) and natural (including forest, uplands, wetlands, creeks and streams), and MPX is a measure of the degree of habitat (specifically forest) fragmentation within a specified buffer, which is caused by urbanization in our study system. Thus, the same group of species also can be considered \u2018sensitive\u2019 to urbanization. It is not particularly surprising that the species in this group should be sensitive to urbanization, as they depend upon upland forest areas (open\u2010canopied oak and pine flatwoods) near cypress swamps and wet prairies characterized by short hydroperiods (Harper 1932; Wright & Wright 1949; Hamilton 1955; Duellman & Schwartz 1958; Pechmann et al. 1989; Marshall & Camp 1995). In a previous study conducted in the same general area, three of the species, A. quercicus, H. femoralis, and H. gratiosa, only occurred in wetlands surrounded by an upland matrix of natural pine flatwoods and were excluded from areas of urban development (Delis, Mushinsky & McCoy 1996) as a result of degradation of the uplands used during the dry season and of the wetlands used during the breeding season. Some anurans are not as sensitive to urbanization as others, such as species that are fully aquatic or that depend on non\u2010forested upland habitat (Cushman 2006), but, for the group of sensitive species we have identified, it appears that adverse effects of habitat fragmentation accompanying urbanization (reduced MPX values which equate to reduced patch size and increased patch isolation) are severe. In contrast, species we identified within a second positively co\u2010occurring group are associated with wetland edges (Wright 1932; Carr 1940; Wright & Wright 1949; Conant & Collins 1991) and thus are less sensitive to the structure of the surrounding habitat.",

As urban wetlands gradually deteriorate from excessive groundwater withdrawal, the species sensitive to this degradation gradually disappear because of urbanization itself. To our knowledge, no study has shown that a useful indicator of one type of anthropogenic stressor is rendered useless because of another type. This is not likely to be local or restricted to urban wellfields, but potentially could occur anywhere that indicator species are used to monitor ecosystem health or provide an early warning signal of decline. Examples of these indicators include Great Lakes coastal wetlands, where the spring peeper Pseudacris crucifer has been shown to contribute to assessment of anthropogenic disturbance (Price et al. 2007); in Mediterranean wetlands, where amphibian richness relates positively to watershed habitat heterogeneity and negatively to the percentage of the watershed area devoted to olive cultivation (Garc\u00eda\u2010Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2010); in Mexican cloud forests, where groups of frog species are sensitive to fragmentation, diminishing canopy cover, and declining patch area (Pineda & Halffter 2004); in California streams, where three species of amphibians are sensitive to sedimentation (Welsh & Ollivier 1998); and in Kentucky streams, where juveniles of several anuran species are sensitive to PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) contamination (Degarady & Halbrook 2006). When amphibians are used to monitor the effects of increasing sedimentation rates, chemical pollutants and nutrient loading, for example, but are also affected by other stressors, their reliability as indicators may be compromised.",

In some areas, we may be able to use anuran species that are relatively tolerant of urban conditions (e.g. fragmentation) to gauge wetland integrity (e.g. groundwater withdrawal). Although most species that are sensitive to habitat degradation are likely to be excluded from urban wetlands, a few may use both natural and urban wetlands. However, using species tied to ephemeral wetlands is difficult in urban areas where there are often few ephemeral ponds (Rubbo & Kiesecker 2005). Additionally, urban tolerant species with either extremely rapid or slow larval development would not be good candidates as indicators because those with rapid development might still call at a monitored wetland, but metamorph quickly enough to escape pressures of increased groundwater withdrawal, and those with considerably slower larval development could call at the wetland but tadpoles might not survive excessive withdrawal.",

Even within the same taxonomic group or species guild, there is no assurance that habitat changes affecting one species will be the same for other species in the group or guild (Block, Brennan & Guti\u00e9rrez 1987). We conclude that while anurans are effective indicators and are complementary to vegetation, the usefulness of this group in monitoring wetland health can be substantially reduced, or eliminated, because they are also simultaneously sensitive to urban sprawl.
