In addition to the 800-current staff (doctors nurses and others) of the hospital, over 2000 staff from 12 other provinces were employed to provide medical care on the general wards and intensive care unit (ICU) of the west campus of Union Hospital. There was a rapid response team available 24/7 to attempt resuscitation for patients with IHCA; this team was also in charge of tracheal intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the general ward when needed. The team were alerted using a pager system. Resuscitation followed guidelines from the American Heart Association and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation for advanced cardiac life support and post-resuscitation care. Ward staff (usually nurses) started CPR and if defibrillation prior to team arrival. All staff (clinical and non-clinical) working on the general ward, ICU and rapid response team donned personal protective equipment (PPE) at the beginning of their shift. For all settings this included protective clothing, a N95 mask and visor. Due to the exertion required of doing continuous chest compressions whilst wearing PPE, the person doing compressions was changed after at most one minute. A mechanical chest compression device was only available in ICU.",

A retrospective cohort study in Wuhan reported that 54 of 191 patients died in the hospital, and older age, higher SOFA score, and elevated d-dimer at admission were risk factors for death of adults with COVID-19.2. In another report from Wuhan, the mortality rate was 62% among critically ill patients with COVID-19 and 81% among those requiring mechanical ventilation.3. Meanwhile, Washington state, USA reported a mortality rate of 67%, and 24% of the patients remained critically ill and 9.5% were discharged from the ICU.11. We observed an overall mortality rate of 19.3% in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia during the study period. The difference may be due to the severity of patients enrolled in the analysis, management of intensive care, and the capacity of hospitalisation for patients.",

The shortage of medical resources and uncertain quality of CPR were key factors in the resuscitation of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan. As COVID-19 spread, the number of critically ill patients exceeded the capacity of ICUs in most hospitals in Wuhan. It was not rare for critically patients to stay in the general ward with limited advanced life-support facilities. With an improvement in recognition and protection strategies, two newly constructed hospitals and several isolation hospitals were soon brought into service. As the west campus of Union Hospital was designated for patients with severe pneumonia, the defibrillation and advanced airway interventions and mechanical ventilation could be established in the general ward with the help of a 24/7 rapid response team. Although a growing number of mechanical compression devices had been introduced in hospitals, there was still a significant lack of intensive care resources. In addition, few patients had do-not-attempt CPR (DNACPR) decision. The patients were cared for in isolation wards, and visiting by relatives was very limited. Only five patients who had a cardiac arrest had a DNACPR decision. We did not make any DNACPR decisions without discussion with a relative.",

Although the World Health Organisation and National Health Commission of China have issued preliminary guidance on infection control, screening, and diagnosis in the general population, in addition to the guidelines issued by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel who provided recommendations to support hospital clinicians managing critically ill adults with COVID-19, there is still limited guidance based on clinical research on the acute management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.14, 15. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In our study, there were numerous patients with severe pneumonia who were resuscitated in the general ward, resulting in a poor outcome when compared with those who received intensive care in the ICU. The difficulties in managing rapid deterioration, acute respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome in a general ward setting may have also contributed to the poor outcomes.",

First, many data points in the resuscitation process were not documented, such as duration of resuscitation efforts, time to first defibrillation, and time to first epinephrine. Second, we do not know the precise interventions that patients had prior to cardiac arrest. Third, this study involved only one centre and the results may not be generalisable to other settings and healthcare systems. The relatively few cases and survivors means that our confidence in our estimates of outcome is low. To explore the risk factors for outcome, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied, but no significant difference were found. More studies are needed to better understand the incidence and outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome and critical illnesses caused by COVID-19, which will be important for critical care management and resource planning. Finally, a lack of data regarding CPR quality is also a limitation. It was also difficult to identify the differences between general wards that were managed by staff from different hospitals. These variations in resuscitation efforts and post-arrest care could also affect the survival outcomes and results. Finally, although we did not study this formally, we are not aware of any clinical staff involved in a resuscitation attempt becoming infected with COVID-19 as a result of their involvement.",
