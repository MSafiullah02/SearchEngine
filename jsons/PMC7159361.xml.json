A recent example is the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti, where DNA sequence data have been cited as evidence supporting the hypothesis that United Nations troops introduced the disease 1. In such cases a high degree of similarity between the molecular characteristics of microbial isolates sampled from victims and those from the putative source is usually assumed to support the source hypothesis. Similarly, in human immunodeficiency virus or Hepatitis C Virus transmission cases the degree of similarity of the sequences from victim and (putative) source relative to a set of \u201cbackground\u201d isolates is proffered as evidence favoring or excluding the transmission hypothesis 2, 3.",

For example, phylogenetic construction alone cannot assess the probability that two isolates come from a common unidentified source of infection, or are separated by one or more unknown intermediate infected hosts. Obviously, if unknown or unsampled source candidates exist, phylogenetics cannot exclude them. In many investigations it is not possible to identify all potential sources with certainty, or the relevant isolates and their genetic sequences may not be available. This limitation has led to highly precautionary guidelines about the use of microbial phylogenetic evidence in criminal prosecutions and to restrictions on the language of admissible testimony 6. Thus, how to quantify and express the degree of support that molecular comparisons provide for a source\u2010transmission hypothesis remains a central, yet unresolved question 7.",

For any pair of isolates sampled from two different nodes in the network, we can define some metric \u03b4 that characterizes their degree of similarity. The ION method assumes that we can infer M0, the number of steps that separate these two nodes, from the observed value of \u03b4 by utilizing two empirically derived statistical distributions. The first is P(\u03b4|M), the probability that the sequences of two isolates taken from nodes M steps apart will differ by \u03b4.

However, we assume that horizontal gene transfer has a negligible effect on the population of genotypes over the network size (or duration of the outbreak) of interest.

Recently several papers have developed methods for integrating genomic sequence data with contact tracing and timing information to infer more accurate transmission trees than can be determined by contact tracing alone 10, 11. Exhaustive genetic sampling of a large proportion of infected hosts in an outbreak is generally impractical, but these papers show that a small segment of the complete outbreak tree can be studied this way.

However, the reference set for ION does not have to encompass an entire connected transmission tree. In fact, only a set of M = 1 related pairs is needed. This convenient simplification is implied by the standard theories of genetic change used to construct phylogenetic relationships 12. If \u03b4 is a random variable distributed as P(\u03b4|M = 1) for a single transmission step, and each transmission event represents an independent sampling of the genomic distribution in the transmitting host, then \u03b4 after M transmission steps is distributed as the sum of M independent random variables each distributed as P(\u03b4|M = 1) 13. Distributions consistent with this constraint have a functional form such that if P(\u03b4|M = 1) = f(\u03b3), where \u03b3 is proportional to the average number of mutations observed between isolates when M = 1, then P(\u03b4|M) = f(M\u03b3). Distributions for discrete random variables such as the Poisson, generalized Poisson, and negative binomial have this property, and can be used to infer P(k|M) from P(k|M = 1) when phylogenetic branch lengths can be approximated by the observed number of mutational changes.",

Generally, \u03b4 is a stochastic variable governed by a probability distribution\nP(\u03b4|M;t1,t2,N),where M is the number of transmission steps separating the two nodes, the parameters t1 and t2 represent the time intervals between infection of each node and the time when isolates are obtained from each of them, typically unknown stochastic variables in an actual outbreak. Nrepresents the number of generations of replication that has taken place between infection of node 1 and the transmission event to node 2. Clearly M and N are roughly proportional on average, although N itself is a stochastic variable. The ION approach simply assumes that our inferences can be based on empirical approximations to P(\u03b4|M) in which t1, t2, and Nhave effectively been \u201caveraged out\u201d as nuisance variables 14. The effect of this averaging is to favor overdispersed models like the negative binomial or generalized Poisson. These distributions have one more parameter than the Poisson, and thus require larger datasets to drive down the relative uncertainty in their parameter values. Therefore, in the face of small datasets we have adopted the practice of using a Poisson model if this hypothesis cannot be rejected by a standard chi\u2010squared test.",

For example, the number of paths of length M among the set of nodes can be determined by using a result from graph theory that relates this quantity to the number of unit matrix elements found in successive powers of the adjacency matrix 16. The observed variations in P(M) from tree to tree can be considered sampling errors about some most likely distribution that characterizes trees for outbreaks of that particular disease and that number of nodes. Extensive computer simulations of transmission trees have shown that the variance in P(M) become small for trees larger than about 20 nodes, so that Eq. (1) is rather insensitive to the actual tree. Moreover, for large trees Eq. (1) also becomes independent of the number of nodes.

However, there are a significant number of instances where Cottam assessed the opportunity for a transmission event to be low, while P(M = 1|k) supports the hypothesis of transmission. The clearest case of discrepancy involves the direct transmission link between nodes K and F, which receives moderate support from our analysis while the timing discrepancy between outbreaks at the two farms would apparently preclude direct transmission. A possible explanation is that infection of K was caused by contaminated fomites from farm F whose transport to K was delayed, but not stopped by isolation measures. Because FMDV can survive in the environment for long times and remain infective 28, such delayed transmission is not implausible. Note that there is no significance to cases where Cottam's likelihood is greater than P(M = 1|k) since timing overlap does not necessarily imply transmission. On the other hand, the fact that there are no cases where Cottam finds the likelihood of transmission to be > 0.5 while we find P(M = 1|k) < 0.5 does not have an obvious explanation other than chance.",
