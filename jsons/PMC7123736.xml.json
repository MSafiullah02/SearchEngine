            "text": "Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains a potentially curative treatment for life-threatening hematological and non-hematological diseases. Over the last several years, the total number of HCTs performed worldwide has exceeded 60,000 a year (Niederwieser et al. 2016; Gratwohl et al. 2010). Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) accounts for the majority of all procedures performed, and in the United States, the number continues to increase at a fast rate, mainly from transplants performed for plasma cell and lymphoproliferative disorders extending to older patients (Gratwohl et al. 2010; Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) 2016). Allogeneic HCTs (allo-HCT) have exceeded 30,000 per year worldwide with the number of transplant recipients surpassing 8000 a year in the United States (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) 2016). Approximately 70% of allogeneic transplants use hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from volunteered unrelated donors (URDs). Advances in HLA typing, new immunosuppressive protocols, improved supportive care, and the administration of nonmyeloablative (NMA) or reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens contribute to the increased frequency of HCT. The observed continuous annual increase of around 10% is mainly because of a rise in allo-HCT from URDs (Gratwohl et al. 2010, 2013). There has also been an increase in alternate donor sources with HLA-haploidentical donors now exceeding umbilical cord blood transplants (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) 2016).",

At the same time, there is also potential harm to any recipient through the infusion of the graft, especially by communicable diseases. For allogenic donors, it is important to optimize the whole donation experience as these donors will undergo a procedure for which they will not be receiving any direct benefit. There is however a potential sense of satisfaction derived from this altruistic act (Boo et al. 2011). Therefore, for URD, an excellent reputation of a safe and efficient process is needed to ensure adequate number of donors being maintained and joining the national registries (Billen et al. 2014).",

            "text": "Given the extensive international collaboration and exchange of HPC products, most regulatory agencies work closely with national registries, such as the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) and the World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA). These national registries develop and establish appropriate guidance to ensure HPC donation is performed safely and ethically in volunteer URDs and have published their recommendations for donor evaluation (Sacchi et al. 2008; Lown et al. 2014; National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) n.d.-a). Donors are assessed as to their suitability and eligibility to donate HPCs. Donor suitability refers to the general health or medical fitness of any autologous or allogeneic HPC donor to undergo the collection procedures. Donors are evaluated as to their risk and overall safety to donate. Donor eligibility refers to issues that relate to an allogeneic donor for who all screening and testing has been completed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and who has been determined to be free of risk factors for relevant communicable diseases. URDs are only eligible if they are unrestrictedly healthy. Often however, physicians struggle with decision making as to the suitability of a relative as a donor that would not otherwise meet the suitability criteria for unrelated donation. The suitability criteria for related donors (RDs) is often less strict and with considerable variability between transplant centers. Differences between RDs and URDs may exist in mobilization and collection practices (Sacchi et al. 2008; Confer et al. 2011; O\u2019Donnell et al. 2010; Clare et al. 2010). Published data suggest that the risks for serious adverse events and reactions might be higher for RDs than for URDs, but the amount of adequate prospective data in the RD setting is still limited (Halter et al. 2009; Kodera et al. 2014). Many institutions have developed their own processes for the evaluation of RDs; historically, there had been no national guidance available. In 2015, the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Standing Committee on Donor Issues developed a consensus document with recommendations for donor workup and final clearance of family donors that would otherwise not be able to serve as URD because of age or preexisting diseases (Worel et al. 2015).",

The donor should be aware that they are not obliged to donate, even if for a family member.

It is important to note that in children majority of grafts are of bone marrow origin. Side effects include pain, either from G-CSF treatment, placement of central venous catheter (CVC), or the puncture wounds made when harvesting bone marrow. Most young donors will require a CVC for apheresis, thus, exposing them to potential risks such as bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, and complications of sedation or general anesthesia (Pulsipher et al. 2005; Styczynski et al. 2012). Collection of peripheral blood graft requires special attention in children, with the use of growth factors being the main issue. Long-term adverse effects from a brief treatment course with G-CSF for the harvest of HPCs via apheresis continues to be studied in ongoing investigations, but to date, no convincing evidence has shown significant health risks (Pulsipher et al. 2006). The worldwide network for blood and marrow transplantation (WBMT) recommends G-CSF is used with caution and only when needed and emphasize the need for long-term follow-up for these donors (Halter et al. 2013). Several published findings suggest that pediatric donors may experience psychosocial issues around the time of and following donation including higher anxiety and lower self-esteem than non-donors (Packman et al. 2008), moderate levels of post-traumatic stress, depression, behavioral problems, identity problems, guilt, and resentment (Packman et al. 1997, 2008; Wiener et al. 2007). Young donors may also fear the medical aspects and pain involved in donation and experience anxiety and ambivalence about donation (Kinrade 1987; MacLeod et al. 2003).",

In some reports, HPC collection by apheresis seems to be a safe procedure for donors \u226560 including those with significant comorbidities (Ghada et al. 2006). However, certain complications are more frequent in the older donors and have demonstrated more procedure related complications than younger donors (Lys\u00e1k et al. 2011). For example, one study demonstrated higher complications associated with hypocalcemia, thrombocytopenia, and problems with venous access in donors \u226555 years of age compared with younger donors (29% vs. 15%, P = 0.0096). Venous access complications were also more frequently present in donors with circulatory system diseases (arterial hypertension, chronic venous insufficiency) compared with the donors without this medical history (11% vs. 3%, P = 0.006) (Lys\u00e1k et al. 2011). A recent related-donor safety study, looking at health-related quality of life issues among older related HCT donors (>60 years) compared to younger adult counterparts, showed very few differences in indicators in physical and mental health donation-related experiences (Switzer et al. 2017). This may suggest that older sibling donors do not experience the donation process as significantly more physically or psychologically impactful than their younger counterparts and, in some aspects, their experiences were more positive\u2014for example, less donation-related pain and less anxiety about donation. There was less conclusive evidence supporting the procedure in sibling donors as old as mid-70s (Switzer et al. 2017).",

Several studies have however reported contradictory results regarding donor-predicting factors for mobilization and yield and cannot confirm an independent influence of age on mobilization (Bagnara et al. 2000; Miflin et al. 1996; Rinaldi et al. 2012).

            "text": "In autologous transplantation, elderly patients can have a high risk of poor mobilization (Goker et al. 2015). Some studies reported that CD34+ cell mobilization in patients of advanced age (70 years and older) with multiple myeloma was poor but still possible (Morris et al. 2003). This is contrary to that reported suggesting no differences in the mobilization kinetics between younger (<65 years) and older (\u226565 years) myeloma patients (Jantunen et al. 2006). Other investigations into whether age affects mobilization in autologous transplantation has also been contradictory in donors <70 years old (Bensinger et al. 1994, 1995). Therefore, age can be a confounding factor in autologous stem cell mobilization. Several donor factors predict outcome after allo-HCT and age is one of the important non-HLA factors affecting the survival rates after transplantation (Kollman et al. 2001). Clinical practice often prefers \u201cHLA-matched siblings\u201d as first-line donors for transplantation despite donor\u2019s age; however, the survival rates for unrelated donor transplants with young fully HLA compatible donors are similar to those using older sibling donors (Kollman et al. 2016). Allo-HCT from older adults have been associated with higher nonrelapse mortality (NRM) but donor age was not associated with relapse (Kollman et al. 2016). Observed higher rates of grade II to IV acute GvHD after transplantation of grafts from older donors may be explained by replacement of na\u00efve T-cells with memory T-cells as the immune system ages in the older donors (Miller 1996).",

In particular, they suggest there should be significant consideration for registry provision of centralized donor follow-up (Anthias et al. 2015). Donor long-term follow-up is an important aspect of donor evaluation and further development of follow up of donors should be an integral part of a donor program to allow vigilance and surveillance of donations and improve knowledge of the risks of donation.",

Unlike bone marrow tissue, it was felt that peripheral blood HPC are no different from other body fluids like semen and plasma where national organ transplant act (NOTA) does not prohibit paid donors. In a concession to the spirit of NOTA, it was deemed that the compensation could not be in the form of cash but rather a voucher that can be applied to things such as scholarships, education, housing, or donation to a charity. In 2011, the WMDA put out a position statement why HPC donors should not be paid (Boo et al. 2011). Reasons included ethical concerns raised by remuneration, potential to damage the public will to act altruistically, the potential for coercion and exploitation of donors, increased risk to patients, and harm to local transplantation programs and international stem cell exchange, and the povssibility of benefiting some patients while disadvantaging others.",
