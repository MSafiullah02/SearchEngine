In critically ill patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, our study shows that ribavirin and pegylated interferon alfa-2a therapy is associated with a significant 14-day survival benefit compared with standard treatment. 28-day survival also seemed to improve with ribavirin and pegylated interferon alfa-2a therapy, but the difference between groups was not significant (panel\n). The loss of a significant survival difference over time might be partly explained by most patients in our cohort having several comorbidities with high APACHE II and SOFA scores. Mortality is known to be very high in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection who need critical-care support.24 Therefore, long-term survival benefit, if present, might be difficult to show in smaller studies.PanelResearch in context\nSystematic review\nWe searched PubMed for reports published in English any time before June 24, 2014, with the search term \u201c[(MERS-CoV OR HCoV-EMC OR novel coronavirus) AND (therapy OR interferon OR ribavirin]\u201d. We found one animal study,14 two small case series in human beings,18, 19 and several in-vitro studies.13, 20, 21, 22, 23 The data suggested that combination therapy with ribavirin and interferon alfa could have potential benefits for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection.\nInterpretation\nThis is, to our knowledge, the largest clinical study done so far assessing the potential benefit and safety of combination therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection. Because we noted a significant 14-day survival benefit in patients who received the combination compared with those who received supportive therapy only, but no survival benefit at 28 days, we recommend further assessment in appropriately designed randomised clinical trials to provide further information about the role of this combination in the treatment of patients with severe MERS-CoV infection.",

Undoubtedly, new interventions should ideally be assessed in randomised, controlled clinical trials. However, such an approach is generally accepted to not always be practically feasible in the context of an emerging and relatively uncommon disease such as MERS-CoV infection.8 We carefully selected our comparator group, ensuring that the two cohorts were matched as closely as possible in their clinical characteristics and treatment interventions other than the receipt of ribavirin and interferon. We removed three individuals who had outlying baseline serum creatinine from the comparator group to minimise the risk of any spurious conclusions driven by clinical characteristics that might be potentially detrimental to clinical outcome. Clinical outcomes for each individual were masked from investigators who selected patients and did matching assessments. The absence of serial viral load measurement in lower respiratory tract samples in our study makes it impossible to show any association between temporal viral load changes and antiviral therapy. Such measurements should be included in any future clinical studies exploring the therapeutic benefit of any antiviral intervention for patients with MERS-CoV infection.",

Treatment with oral ribavirin and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a is associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days. The combination is associated with significant falls in haemoglobin, but no other significant adverse effects were noted. Treatment with ribavirin and pegylated interferon might be considered in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, provided that adequate monitoring and assessment can be ensured. Further assessment, including in patients with less severe MERS-CoV infection, in appropriately designed randomised trials, is recommended.",
