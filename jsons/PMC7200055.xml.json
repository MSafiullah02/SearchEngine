A total of 26 recipients (72%) were male, and the median age was 60 years (range, 32 to 77). Fourteen recipients (39%) were black, and 15 recipients (42%) were Hispanic. Twenty-seven recipients (75%) had received a deceased-donor kidney; 34 recipients (94%) had hypertension, 25 (69%) had diabetes mellitus, 13 (36%) had a history of smoking tobacco or were current smokers, and 6 (17%) had heart disease. Thirty-five of the patients (97%) were receiving tacrolimus, 34 (94%) were receiving prednisone, and 31 (86%) were receiving mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid.",

Twenty-seven of the hospitalized patients (96%) had radiographic findings that were consistent with viral pneumonia, and 11 (39%) received mechanical ventilation.

At a median follow-up of 21 days (range, 14 to 28), 10 of the 36 kidney-transplant recipients (28%) and 7 of the 11 patients who were intubated (64%) had died. Two of the 8 patients who were monitored as outpatients died at home; both were recent kidney-transplant recipients who had received antithymocyte globulin within the previous 5 weeks (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).",

Apixaban was administered to patients with d-dimer levels higher than 3.0 \u03bcg per milliliter. Six severely ill patients received the CCR5 inhibitor leronlimab (PRO 140, CytoDyn) on a compassionate-use basis, and 2 received the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab. Interleukin-6 levels were very elevated (range, 83 to 8175 pg per milliliter) when leronlimab was initiated (on day 0) in the 5 patients with elevated interleukin-6 levels; these levels decreased markedly 3 days later (range, 37 to 2022 pg per milliliter) (see Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).

The number of our patients with very low CD3, CD4, and CD8 cell counts indirectly supports the need to decrease doses of immunosuppressive agents in patients with Covid-19, especially in those who have recently received antithymocyte globulin, which decreases all T-cell subsets for many weeks. Our results show a very high early mortality among kidney-transplant recipients with Covid-19 \u2014 28% at 3 weeks as compared with the reported 1% to 5% mortality among patients with Covid-19 in the general population who have undergone testing in the United States and the reported 8 to 15% mortality among patients with Covid-19 who are older than 70 years of age.",
