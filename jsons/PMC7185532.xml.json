RV serotypes are classified as major or minor group depending on the surface receptor used to infect target cells. More than 90% of RV serotyped strains belong to the major group and use as receptor the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), while the minor group RV strains bind to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on target cells [1], [2]. As the causative agents of the common cold and acute respiratory tract infections in children, RVs are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality [3]. In addition, RVs are the predominant agents associated with pulmonary exacerbations of CF lung disease as they are detected in up to 40% of all virus-associated CF exacerbations [4], [5], [6]. The mechanisms of acute virus-mediated exacerbations in CF are so far poorly understood.",

Defective interferon (IFN) type I (IFN-\u03b2) and type III (IFN-\u03bbs) production of the bronchial airway epithelium upon RV infection has been identified as a contributing mechanism behind the impaired RV control in asthmatic adults and children [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. The work of two groups studying mechanisms of viral control and IFN induction in BECs and macrophages collected from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) led to controversial results. After growing BECs at air\u2013liquid interface (ALI), Schneider et al. showed an increase in IFN production upon RV infection. Despite that, cells showed an impaired viral control and an increased pro-inflammatory phenotype [17]. On the other hand, Mallia et al. found lower IFNs responses upon infection with RV by BAL macrophages from COPD patients compared to control subjects [18].",

Levels of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as dsRNA protein kinase R (PKR), 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), MxA (Myxovirus resistance gene A), and viperin (virus inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, IFN inducible) were also measured. Finally, the inflammatory response mediated by RV infection of CF BECs has also been quantified through the measurement of CXCL8/IL-8, IL-6 and CXCL10/IP-10 cytokines release.",

There is growing evidence that an impaired antiviral response mediated by the IFN pathway may contribute to the increased susceptibility towards RV infection of asthmatic [12], [13], [16] and COPD [17], [18], [23] patients. In order to determine if the IFN pathway is also playing a role in the RV-associated morbidity of the CF lung disease, we used primary cultures of CF and healthy BECs. The expression levels of IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb2/3 in CF BECs infected with RV1B were higher than the levels found in healthy BECs. Also, primary CF and healthy BECs stimulated with poly(IC) gave similar IFN levels. However, we observed a trend towards lower RV16-induced levels of IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2/3 and IFN-\u03b2 in CF BECs in comparison to healthy BECs. This observation is in line with the results from Chattoraj et al. who reported a decreased IFN response in CF BECs in comparison to healthy BECs after infection with major group RV. Interestingly, the IFN response of CF BECs was even lower after co-infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and major group RV [24]. Also, the same authors suggest that RV infection of CF patients is exacerbating lower airway symptoms by promoting the outgrowth of P. aeruginosa\n[25]. Interestingly, Stelzer-Braid et al. reported recently that most of CF pulmonary exacerbations triggered by RVs are not associated with the presence of bacterial pathogens as assessed by multiplex RT-PCR [26]. Thus, the exact contribution and the mechanism of P. aeruginosa in RV-induced exacerbation of CF deserve further investigation.",

The inflammatory cytokines produced by CF BECs upon poly(IC) stimulation were altered as demonstrated by the elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines CXCL8/IL-8 and IL-6. Also, we found an increased constitutive release of CXCL8/IL-8, IL-6 and CXCL10/IP-10 by CF BECs compared to healthy BECs. This observation is in accordance with previous reports attributing an intrinsic inflammatory phenotype to CF airway cells [7], [28], and is compatible with our ex vivo data showing elevated inflammatory cytokine concentrations in BALs of stable CF patients [10]. In line with the elevated PRRs and ISGs of CF BECs stimulated with poly(IC), poly(IC) stimulation led to a hyper-inflammatory response of CF BECs in comparison to healthy BECs as evidenced by the elevated levels of CXCL8/IL-8 and IL-6. However, since both cytokines are constitutively elevated in CF BECs, it is unclear yet if the increased inflammatory response of CF BECs to poly(IC) is solely due to poly(IC) stimulation or as an additive effect to the already elevated baseline levels of CXCL8/IL-8 and IL-6. Additional experiments are required with other inflammatory stimuli in order to address this question. In contrast to IL-8 and IL-6, CXCL10/IP-10 levels upon stimulation with poly(IC) were significantly decreased in CF cells in comparison to control cells. This observation is possibly explained by the fact that the regulation of the CXCL10/IP-10 gene transcription is under the control of the IFN pathway [29], [30].",

All these viruses are inducing distinct pathogenesis in the lung and it is therefore conceivable that the mechanisms of virus-induced CF exacerbation are at least in part virus-specific. In line with this hypothesis, a recent study by Ramirez et al. demonstrated that CF exacerbations triggered by RV or influenza virus led to a distinct antiviral response [37]. Therefore, it would be interesting to test our in vitro system with other clinically relevant respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus.",

Major group RV infection is leading to a diminished IFN pathway response at the level of IFNs, PRRs, and ISGs. However, IFN pathway induction in CF BECs upon minor group RV infection was higher than in healthy BECs. Also, CF BECs have an intrinsic inflammatory phenotype as assessed by the constitutive elevated release of CXCL8/IL-8 and IL-6 and CXCL10/IP-10 cytokines. Finally, since our study is based on a small number of subjects, our data need further confirmation in a large study population.",
