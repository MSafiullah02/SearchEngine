There was geographic variability in program experiences, with west coast programs reporting multiple weeks of COVID-19 related experience, and programs on the east coast reporting that rapid changes had begun only two weeks before our call. The discussion among LEAH Directors highlighted geographic variability in response to COVID-19 infection, with Seattle reporting early response, San Francisco and Los Angeles reporting responses shortly thereafter, followed by rapidly evolving responses in Minneapolis, Birmingham, Philadelphia, and Boston. All programs reported changes related to cancellations of in-person courses, graduations and sports events, closure of non-essential businesses and daycares, and implementation of social distancing and stay-at-home policies.

Elective admissions, surgeries, and procedures had been canceled across institutions. Several programs developed strategies to reduce inpatient adolescent admissions, including refining eating disorder admission criteria. Several programs discussed that they had implemented protocols that allowed for more rapid refeeding. These changes, combined with a reduction of patients presenting to the hospital, resulted in significant reductions in the inpatient census at these institutions. To preserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and promote social distancing, inpatient consultations in some institutions were being conducted by telehealth or phone. In some programs, hospitalized patients on COVID precautions were given specially programmed tablets to communicate directly with nurses and medical staff, thereby preserving PPE. Across institutions, reduced numbers of team members participated in in-person patient care, with a focus on limiting inperson visits to those that involved performing a physical examination. Similarly, numbers of people involved in in-person patient care conferences was limited, and social distancing was addressed with chair spacing. Several programs had developed strategies for direct admission for eating disorder patients to reduce risk for emergency room exposure. Some hospitals had adopted strategies to increase regional adult bed capacity, including closing community pediatric wards and directing all pediatric admissions to the children's hospital, or admitting young adult patients to the children's hospital.",

            "text": "Most LEAH programs include substantial research portfolios, and some include clinical research projects that require staff to have direct interactions with human subjects. Research projects across locations have been impacted by restrictions on in-person contact. Recruitment dependent on access to clinical sites has been halted. In some locations, in-person recruitment has been transitioned to alternative recruitment strategies when feasible. In-person data collection has been changed to alternative strategies when feasible. Clinical trials in some instances have been put on hold. Timelines for project completion have been altered. The annual national Pediatric Academic Society Meeting scheduled in May 2020 has been cancelled. This cancellation, along with the recent SAHM Meeting cancellation, has severely limited opportunities for trainees and faculty to present their research and scholarly activity at national meetings in 2020. Directors and program faculty encouraged their trainees to submit accepted research presentations to online forums being hosted by SAHM and other professional organizations that have cancelled in-person scientific meetings. Some programs noted that local institutional forums for trainees to present their research were being shifted from inperson formats to innovative virtual formats. Fortunately, with some lead time and creative work, the Academy for Eating Disorders has transformed their in-person meeting in Australia in June to a virtual International Conference on Eating Disorders with the help of LEAH faculty and other members.",

We are all experiencing a disruptive and stressful time that involves many unknown factors and extraordinarily rapid change. LEAH Project Directors discussed the importance, and challenge, of demonstrating calm consistent responsible leadership. Everyone has found that communication with faculty, trainees, and staff require daily or weekly emails, virtual meetings, and \"town meetings with leadership\" to provide sufficient information that is inclusive and honest, recognizes the significant stress everyone is feeling, solicits creative solutions from all stakeholders, and is accompanied by explanations of the next steps being taken to meet challenges. Fulfilling this professional responsibility, as well as fulfilling a wide range of personal responsibilities involving family and friends, requires self-compassion and self-care. Indeed, LEAH faculty and fellows have discovered the benefits of the 30 minute \"crash\" course in resiliency and adaptive leadership, part of the \"MCH Competency-Based Resources for Difficult Times,\" (https://www.mchnavigator.org/transformation/mini-moduleresilience.php) disseminated by the MCH Navigator March 27, 2020. Modeling high-quality leadership, supporting leaders in our own groups, supporting colleagues in leadership roles, and encouraging our trainees to closely observe and learn from different effective leadership strategies -are all important opportunities that should not be missed.",

During this brief conversation among seven LEAH program leaders, the value of sharing experiences and expertise became clear. We were able to identify similar challenges, learn about challenges that could be anticipated in the near future, and share a variety of strategies being developed or implemented to overcome these challenges. One conversation immediately informed problem solving at multiple institutions. Follow-up communication has continued to support sharing of resources and technical assistance across programs. During times of crisis, working and sharing together, can produce effective action.",

Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption it is causing in young people's lives will likely have ongoing impact for all young people. 5 We need to be actively engaged in identifying opportunities to support the mental health and well-being of young people through these challenging times.",
