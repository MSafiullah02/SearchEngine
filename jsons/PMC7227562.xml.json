COVID-19 diagnosis and discharge criteria were in accordance with the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 pneumonia by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China [9,10]. The average CT follow-up time is 31.5 days (range, 24 to 39 days) after the initial hospital admission and 16.3 days after discharge (range, 7 to 25 days).",

If the patient had multiple CT examinations during hospitalization, the first CT and the most severe CT examination during the disease progression were scored separately. Ground-glass opacity (GGO) showed a slight increase in density, but the bronchial vascular bundles could still be displayed. Consolidation was defined as opacification in which the underlying vasculature was obscured. Fibrosis was defined as parenchymal bands, irregular interfaces (bronchovascular, pleural, or mediastinal), and traction bronchiectasis [12].",

The early-stage manifestations were single or multiple GGO in both lungs, distributed along the bronchial tract or the periphery of the lung. The lesions in advanced stages increased in size and number, with higher density and consolidation. GGO and consolidation were absorbed during the dissipating phase, and the lesions evolved to fibrosis. Twenty-three (39%) follow-up patients showed residual fibrosis and were classified as Group A whereas, 36 cases (61%) who didn't show definite fibrosis, were classified as Group B. Patients in group B showed incomplete absorption of GGO and thickening of the interlobular septum while three cases showed complete absorption (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n).",

The other six patients had milder lesions, and the imaging manifestations directly entered the dissipating phase from the early phase, and three patients had complete lesion absorption. It is suggested that COVID-19 may be self-limiting. Therefore, timely treatment can shorten the course of the disease, accelerate the absorption of lesions, and the recovery process. Follow-up after discharge showed that 39% of patients had residual fibrosis, 61% had no clear fibrosis. According to Antonio [12], in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the early lung fibrosis rate reaches as high as 62%. COVID-19 has a lower rate of fibrosis than SARS. In addition, SARS causes severe lung parenchymal damage, with a high probability of causing \u201cwhite lung\u201d and mediastinal emphysema [15], while COVID-19 is relatively mild in symptoms, with no mediastinal emphysema seen in this group of cases.",

The patients in the fibrosis group have a higher CT score, longer LOS, and a higher proportion of ICU admissions, suggesting that patients with multiple lesions or severe conditions are more prone to fibrosis. In addition, the patients in the fibrosis group have a high level of C-reactive protein. The C-reactive protein rises sharply in the plasma when the body is infected or tissues are damaged, it activates the complement system and strengthens the phagocytosis of phagocytes, and removes pathogenic microorganisms that invade the body [16,17]. It plays an important protective role in the body's natural immune process, which may accelerate fibrosis formation during this process.",
