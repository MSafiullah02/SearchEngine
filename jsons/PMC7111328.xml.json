The cysteine protease 3CLpro is fuctionally analogous to the main Picornaviridae protease 3Cpro with a catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) in the active site.8 3CLpro Cleaves the replicase polyprotein at 11 conserved sites with canonical Leu-Gln (Ser, Ala, Gly) sequences, in which the P1 position has a well-conserved Gln residue and the P2 position has a hydrophobic amino acid residue.9, 10 Given the essential role in viral processing of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, it is considered as an attractive target for anti-SARS and other coronavirus infections.",

Although this complex has not been deposited in the protein data bank because of the poor structural quality, this fact provided us with an important clue that isatin derivatives can have inhibitory activity against 3CLpro. Previously, Chen and Zhou et al.35, 36 reported a new class of potent, small-molecule isatin-based 3CLpro inhibitors (Fig. 2\n). They concluded that the C-5 position favors a carboxamide group and the N-1 position favors large hydrophobic substituents. In this Letter, we investigated a replacement of the carboxamide group using a series of substituted sulfonamide groups in isatin. We believe that this modification can improve inhibitory activity against SARS CoV 3CLpro. We also carried out molecular docking studies to obtain the potential binding mode of these inhibitors.",

As shown in Figure 3\n, compound 8k1 was hydrogen bonded in Gly143 and Cys145 of protease, and 8k2 generated hydrogen bonds with Gly143, Ser144, and Asn142. Notably, both carbonyl group at the 2-position and nitrogen atom at the 1-position of isatin are important in the formation of hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, the modeling shown in Figure 4\nrevealed that the isatin scaffold was docked at the S1\u2032 site, and the side chain R2 and R3 were located at the S2 and S1 sites of SARS CoV 3CLpro, respectively. The model of compounds and SARS-CoV 3CLpro presented here differed from previously reported 5-carboxamide isatin derivatives.36 The orientation of the isatin core was flipped here in Fig. 4. The substitutions at the 5-position enabled the compounds 8k1 and 8k2 to fit the S2 hydrophobic site in both docking results. Furthermore, the simple six-membered ring sulfonyl group of isatin at the 5-position well fitted S2, as demonstrated in the potent inhibition of 7a and 7i\u2013m. However, the 5-sulfonyl isatin derivatives 7b\u2013h modified by rigid bicyclic substituents at the 5-position did not fit the limited space of S2, which led to diminished inhibitory activity. Interestingly, increasing the length of substitution enabled compounds containing the flexible group 7d\u2013g to extend into the S3 site, which has not been mentioned in previous references. These docking experiments supported the observation in the enzymatic assay that the potency of these derivatives followed the order 7d (31.71 \u03bcM) > \n7a (76.74 \u03bcM) > \n7b (>100 \u03bcM). Regarding the substituent at the N-1 position, the 5-carboxamide group36 was replaced by N-1 substitution here and the methyl and benzyl substitutions more or less accommodated the hydrophobic characteristics at the S1 site. In addition, 8k1 molecule (total score = 8.70) was predicted to show the analogous binding affinity relative to 8k2 (total score = 8.58), which was consistent with the experimental results. Based on the findings above, we believe that the activity of the title compounds can be improved by modifying with the simple six-membered ring at the 5-position and substitution at the N-1 position with a methyl group, which can lead to a better combination of compounds with the protein pocket.",

The results of the current study suggested that 5-sulfonyl isatin derivatives had similar inhibitory activities to the reported 5-carbonyl isatins. Meanwhile, the computer model of the associated complex between the title compounds and protease rationalized their inhibitory activities. Apparently, 5-sulfonyl isatin modified by a simple six-membered ring or a bulky substituent with sufficient flexibility at the 5-position coupled with methyl at the N-1 position could dramatically promote inhibitory activity. In addition, similar orientations of the isatin core were found in both docking and socking studies. This result could serve as an important basis for more structural optimizations.",
