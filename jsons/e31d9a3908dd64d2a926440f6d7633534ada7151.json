Although conventional surfactant-stabilized emulsions have been successfully and extensively used in various fields such as crude oil recovery, food, paints and coatings, and water treatment, the large-scale use of surfactants in industrial applications or personal care products is not cost-effective and in some cases may cause adverse effects such as irritation and hemolytic behavior. Therefore, the use of colloidal particles may be a promising alternative to the use of surfactants, motivating the recent trend in the studies of Pickering emulsions of seeking to enable the commercial manufacturing and practical use of these materials.",

In 1988, Levine and co-workers successfully fabricated an oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion stabilized by hydrophilic silica nanoparticles with the diameter of ~572 nm, and found that a monolayer of silica nanoparticles was formed at the oil-water interface. [8] Since the Pickering emulsion is actually formed by the assembly of colloidal particles at the liquid-liquid interface, the size of the emulsion droplet is inevitably limited by the particulate stabilizers used, and hence the majority of the reported silica-stabilized Pickering emulsions are in the micrometer size range, hindering their use in a wide variety of medical-related applications, and particularly in the applications that require cell penetration. and then chemically modified the silica nanoparticles to make them hydrophobic in order to stabilize the water-in-oil (w/o) Pickering emulsions. It was found that the size of the obtained emulsion droplets could be reduced through the decrease in the diameter of the silica stabilizers, and the diameter of the emulsion droplets can even be smaller than 500 nm when 50 nm silica nanoparticles were used as the emulsifiers.",

The Furthermore, many other inorganic colloidal particle including nonmetallic oxide particles, magnetic particles and elemental particles exhibit good performance for the stabilization of Pickering emulsions. For example, laponite clay consists of disc-like particles, and a toluene-in-water Pickering emulsion was successfully prepared using these particles by Ashby and Binks approximately 20 years ago [13] . In another work, Kikuchi and co-workers fabricated a calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) capsule templated from the Pickering emulsion stabilized by calcium carbonate [14] , and showed that the CaCO 3 capsule is soluble under acidic conditions. ( Figure 1C ) Additionally, carbon-based particles such as carbon quantum dots [15] (Figure 1D ), carbon nanotubes [16, 17] , and graphene oxide particles [18] have been shown to be excellent materials for use as Pickering stabilizers for applications in water purification, biosensors and electrochemistry related fields. On the other hand, metal salts have been rarely used in Pickering emulsions. In the two example of such studies, Chen and coworkers synthesized highly uniform zirconium phosphate (\u03b1-ZrP) nanoparticles to produce \u03b1-ZrP nanodisk-stabilized o/w emulsions [19] (Figure 1E ), and Liu et al. nanoparticles can help to screen UV radiation and enhance the photocatalytic performance. In addition to these two examples, many other inorganic particles such as gold nanospheres have been used as the stabilizers for Pickering emulsions [23] .",

Polystyrene (PS) particles are a classical example of such polymer particles, and were used by Dinsmore et al. to fabricate a \"colloidosome\" capsule that was templated from an o/w Pickering emulsion stabilized by monodispersed PS spheres. [24] The colloidosome structure was fabricated from the emulsion with the full coverage of the PS spheres at the oil droplet. Although the PS spheres were polymer-based, they still behaved as rigid particles due to the high glass transition temperatures (T g ) of the polystyrene polymer. Recently, Douliez et al. [25] reported a hydrogelled colloidosome that was derived from a water-in-water (w/w) Pickering emulsion stabilized by amine-modified polystyrene latex beads. The internal phase of the w/w emulsion was an aqueous liquid filled with dextran, while the continuous phase consisted of a polyethylene oxide (PEG)-enriched solution. After the gelation of the core of the prepared w/w Pickering emulsions, the obtained colloidosome with molecularly crowded interiors displayed reversible swelling, as shown in Figure 2A .",

[34] In the synthesis of microgels, functional and responsive groups are introduced in order to endow the microgels with environmentally-dependent behavior. For the conventional rigid particle stabilized Pickering emulsions, the stabilization mechanism is explained well by the high desorption energy from the interface that can be calculated from the contact angle and the oil-water interfacial tension. However, the stabilization mechanism underlying the preparation of the microgel-stabilized emulsions is far from being completely understood. [35, 36] Compared to the rigid colloids, the microgels are soft, fuzzy, and deformable [26] so that the concept of the contact angle may be not applicable to the microgels at the oil-water interface. In the emulsification process, the microgel is more similar to a polymer emulsifier because it itself is composed of polymers. Thus, the stabilization mechanism may also be explained by the ability of the microgel to reduce the oil-water interfacial tension. A previous study has indicated that soft particles reduced the oil-water interfacial tension more effectively than rigid particles. [37] Moreover, the soft particles also exhibited significantly higher interfacial activity at the oil-water interface than the rigid particles, and a clear correlation between the deformability of the microgels and the emulsions stability arising from the core-shell structure of the microgels was demonstrated [38] . by gelatin particles, [46] and subsequently, numerous edible particle stabilized HIPEs were reported. In Table 1 , for reference, we summarized the studies of edible particles used for the stabilization of Pickering HIPEs reported in the literature in the last two years. ",

Although many methods can be used for producing porous foam, such as freezing-drying, bubbling, and particle scaffolds. [82, 83] In recent years, the applications of Pickering stabilized foams for cell culture have been more focused on the concept of green chemistry, because many protein-based colloidal particles are suitable for the preparation of Pickering HIPEs, and the polymerization or cross-linking can be achieved in a milder manner. [84] In more practical and engineering applications, HIPE templated foams have been widely used for oil/water separation, oil capture, and water treatment. Since the internal volume fraction of the HIPE is very high, the templated foam material displays a low density after liquid removal. When the primary emulsion is of the w/o type, polymerization of the oil liquid can always obtain a hydrophobic scaffold foam.",

[94] Due to its amphiphilic nature and extraordinary interface chemistry properties, GO acts as a sheet-structure colloidal particle for the fabrication of Pickering emulsions, while the GO sheets can assemble in a 3D structure at the liquid-liquid interface. [ Figure 4C ) Similarly, Russell et al. [107] demonstrated that cooperative assembly of amine-functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS-NH 2 ) and Ti 3 C 2 T x -Mxene sheets improved the interfacial activity at the water-oil interface. The obtained w/o emulsion was concentrated by centrifugation to fabricate the MXene aerogel, and it was shown that the aerogel has a macroporous structure and low density, and can be potentially used for oil absorption and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding ( Figure 4D ).",

This review briefly describes the various applications derived from Pickering emulsions focusing on several different categories based on the particle stabilizers comprised by inorganic particles, polymer particles, food-grade particles, and several composite particles and newly-discovered 2D material particles. Due to the recent breakthroughs in particle synthesis, the functionalities of the particle stabilizers endow the as-prepared Pickering emulsions with unique features that are unavailable in conventional surfactant-stabilized emulsions, and many studies have demonstrated the importance of these Pickering emulsions in interfacial catalysis, biomedicine, drug delivery, functional materials and other fields. We believe that the design of engineered colloidal particles will be a popular topic of future research. issues. Finally, we believe that Pickering emulsification is an efficient approach for the assembly of 2D materials at the interface for the construction of 3D functional foams that is envisioned for enabling the applications of the Pickering emulsion derived materials in the fields of electronics, energy, and even wearable devices.",

Based on their fundamental properties, previous academic research on Pickering emulsions has mainly focused on microencapsulation, controlled release, drug delivery, and biphasic catalysis. In addition to their use in emulsions, advanced materials templated or fabricated from Pickering emulsions have also been reported extensively in recent studies, with most of the materials obtained in the form of foams and capsules. Pickering emulsions are excellent templates for the facile preparation of foam materials because the emulsion droplets naturally provide void structures with adjustable pore sizes after evaporation or washing. Meanwhile, the good stability of the Pickering emulsions is beneficial for foam formation during the freezing-drying or polymerization process.

Yang et al.[10] synthesized mesoporous silica nanospheres with tunable interfacial activity, and both o/w and w/o Pickering emulsions were successfully obtained. (Figure 1B) In the synthesis of such mesoporous silica nanoparticles, hydrophilic zwitterionic groups and hydrophobic groups were simultaneously incorporated on the shell so that the obtained Pickering emulsions can switch from o/w to w/o, and were proven to be highly stable against coalescence even at high-salinity conditions. Interestingly, polyoxometalate was carried in the pores of the mesoporous silica, promoting the efficiency of the epoxidation reactions and eliminating the need to stir the emulsions during catalysis. Jiang et al.[11] synthesized dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for stabilizing the o/w Pickering emulsions. While the synthesized mesoporous silica nanoparticles were relatively small with a diameter of only 130 nm, the maximal pore size of these nanoparticles reached ~7 nm, which is larger than that for most MSNs. This enabled the absorption of candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) into the pores of the MSNs with the enzyme loading of 166.3 mg/g support , and a MSNs-stabilized Pickering emulsion platform for interfacial enzymatic catalysis was obtained. In addition to the Pickering emulsions stabilized by solid and mesoporous silica, Bao et al.[12] recently used hollow silica nanoparticles for the stabilization of Pickering emulsions, and found that hollow silica nanoparticles exhibited strong adsorption. The cavity structure endowed the hollow silica nanoparticles with a low density, which may be the reason for the stability of the prepared Pickering emulsions.",

(reproduced from ref. 41 with permission from The Royal Society of Chemistry) One of the signature characteristics of microgel particles is their flexible and easily adjustable structure due to the preparation of the microgel particles by the polymerization of monomers. Specifically, based on the knowledge of polymer chemistry, microgel particles with various functional groups can be synthesized by copolymerizing with different monomers. For instance, temperature-and pH-sensitive microgels can be synthesized by the copolymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and methacrylic acid (MAA), and then the obtained PNIPAM-MAA microgel particles can endow the microgel-stabilized emulsions with controllable stability that is governed by both the temperature and pH. Chen et al.[39] synthesized core-shell microgel particles for stabilizing ionic liquid (IL)-in-water Pickering emulsions, and the monolayer of the microgels adsorbed at the interface even displayed a colloidal lattice structure (Figure 2B). isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) gel-shell, and the whole microgel particle was thermosensitive and pH-responsive. To visualize how the interfacial behavior of the microgel particles at the IL-water interface is influenced by the changes in the environment, the microgel was labeled with a fluorescence agent, and confocal microscopy and Cryo-SEM characterizations clearly demonstrated the packing difference of the microgels at the different conditions.Generally, microgel particles are easily swollen by water and are always considered to be highly hydrophilic. Although they are superior emulsifiers for stabilizing the o/w Pickering emulsion, and even a small amount of microgels is enough to prepare an o/w internal phase Pickering emulsions with a high oil volume fraction close to 0.9[40], the preparation of w/o Pickering emulsions by these water-swollen microgel particles is difficult. To strongly stabilize w/o Pickering emulsions by microgels, the microgels that are dispersed in water should also somehow show hydrophobicity to improve their affinity to the oil component so as to strongly adsorb at the water/oil interface in the preparation of the w/o emulsions. To overcome this issue, nanocomposite microgels with adjustable hydrophobicity and surface roughness were synthesized by Suzuki et al.[41] First, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-fumaric acid) microgels were synthesized and prepared as the seed particles. Then, nanocomposite microgels were synthesized by seeded emulsion polymerization using the seed microgels, and different monomers including methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene (St) were used for linking the seed microgels. Interestingly, it was found that both the hydrophobicity and the surface roughness of the microgels can influence the interfacial behavior of the nanocomposite microgels, and suitable tuning of these properties can control the emulsion type (o/w or w/o) and stabilize the water-in-polar oil or water-in-nonpolar oil Pickering emulsions, as illustrated inFigure 2C. While further studies are still necessary to provide an in-depth understanding of the stabilization mechanism, the existing work on the microgel stabilization of Pickering emulsions has opened a new avenue for the research on Pickering emulsions stabilized by soft particles.2.3 Pickering emulsions stabilized by food-grade particlesThe formulations of many common foods such as chocolate and butter are based on emulsions.[42] However, the applications of particle-stabilized emulsions in food industry is challenging due to the strict limitations on the particulate emulsifiers that can be used in foods. Safety is perhaps the most important issue for the food industry, and safety concerns restrict the range of the possible Pickering stabilizers to edible materials only.[43][44][45] Additionally, food production is always carried out on a large scale, imposing the requirement for the use of inexpensive stabilizers only.Several food-grade particles of natural origin have been successfully explored for forming Pickering emulsions.

(reproduced from ref. 72 with permission from American Chemical Society) Wu et al.[66] developed a Pickering emulsion stabilized by a special colloidal stabilizer, and demonstrated that the interfacial cascade reaction was catalyzed by the stabilizers (Figure 3A). In other words, the colloidal stabilizers acted as both the emulsifiers for the stabilization of the emulsion and as the catalytic sites. In this work, an enzyme-polymer conjugate was innovatively synthesized by the grafting of the enzyme onto the polymer, and the enzyme-polymer conjugates were proven to stabilize the o/w Pickering emulsions. The synthesis of this special kind of particle requires certain skills in both polymer chemistry and biochemistry, because the enzyme protein must be linked to the polymer while maintaining its activity, and atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) was used in the synthesis. Nevertheless, this novel particulate stabilizer paved the way for the use of the protein-stabilized Pickering emulsions for interfacial biphasic biocatalysis, and it was shown that two different enzymes, namely benzaldehyde lyase (BAL) and glucose oxidase (GOx), can be effectively conjugated with the polymer and retain their activity at the liquid-liquid interface. By cooperating with additional enzymes, a Pickering emulsion system for interfacial cascade biocatalysis was built up, significantly broadening the range of application of Pickering emulsion catalysis. Meng et al.[67] immobilized the lipase enzyme in the alginate gel microparticles, and then used the microparticles as the stabilizers for a w/o Pickering emulsion, also achieving the goal of interfacial biocatalysis (Figure 3D). Unlike in the work of Wu et al., an inverse w/o Pickering emulsion was prepared, and a very different method was used for enzyme immobilization. To fix the enzyme in the alginate particle, the lipase was first trapped in the gel network of the alginate, and then the alginate gel was emulsified by silane-grafted titania nanoparticles and surfactant Span 80 to obtain a w/o emulsion with the paraffin oil as the oil phase. After gelation by calcium chloride, a TiO 2 -coated alginate microparticle was formed with the lipase confined inside the microparticle. Then, the wettability of microparticles was changed to stabilize the w/o Pickering emulsion, enabling the catalysis of an esterification reaction at the interface. More recently, the strategy of the use of binary particles for the stabilization of w/o Pickering emulsions for interfacial biocatalysis was developed in our group.[68] In the binary particles, the first component was a pH-responsive microgel that simultaneously encapsulated the enzymes and served as a catalyst carrier, while hydrophobic silica nanoparticles served as the second component that improved the stability of the resultant w/o emulsion, the optical microscopy images of prepared w/o emulsions are illustrated inFigure 3C. It was found that the obtained inverse Pickering emulsion showed ideal catalytic behavior for the reactions at the water-oil interface. The enzyme immobilization method was facile and did not involve chemical bonding, and the Pickering emulsion was also prepared in the normal manner by homogenization. This approach may inspire new insights and methods for the fabrication and applications of Pickering stabilized systems.In another approach, Leclercq and coworkers[69] fabricated Pickering emulsions for interfacial catalysis using two kinds of nanoparticles while controlling the self-assembled behavior of the two colloidal particles and tandem reaction was catalyzed continuously (Figure 3B). Yang et al.[70][71][72][73] filled the catalyst-containing Pickering emulsions stabilized with a variety of particles in continuous flow column reactors, and designed a series of macroscale flow reaction systems for improving the catalytic and recycling efficiencies (",

            "text": "the application of Pickering emulsions in immunologic agents is still challenging. With the progress of modern medicine, enhanced vaccination has become extremely important, and Pickering emulsions are likely to be used in this field in the future. As an initial demonstration, Xia et al.[76] developed a PLGA nanoparticle stabilized squalene-in-water Pickering emulsion adjuvant system for exploiting the force-dependent deformability and lateral mobility. Compared to the conventional emulsions stabilized by surfactants and solid particles, Pickering emulsions displayed an enhanced antigen uptake, and promoted humoral and cellular immune responses. More practically, the PLGA nanoparticle-stabilized Pickering emulsion adjuvant system (PPAS) was further employed in clinical-relevant vaccinations, and immune protection by H1N1 vaccine with PPAS as the adjuvant was investigated experimentally, with the results obtained on mice indicating that PPAS may be a good candidate adjuvant. Unfortunately, the appearance of a number of epidemic diseases and novel viruses such as the influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the novel COVID-19 coronavirus that appeared in 2019 has made development of vaccines increasingly urgent. Although the vaccine itself is the most direct and powerful tool for preventing the virus-borne epidemics, the adjuvant plays an important role in the vaccine formulations.

            "text": "While to date, most Pickering emulsions have been stabilized by particles of a single type, there have been some reports in the literature on the emulsions stabilized with mixed rigid particles, and in several rare cases, binary particles with contrasting features (e.g. softness, hydrophobicity, surface charge) have been used for the co-stabilization of Pickering emulsions. The different emulsifiers can endow the as-prepared Pickering emulsions with multiple functionalities and responses, and the fundamental study of multi-particles' behavior at the emulsion interface and their specific applications should also be considered a promising direction for future research. Additionally, while to date the vast majority of the reported Pickering emulsions have been the single oil-in-water (o/w) or water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions, future work may concentrate on the design of particles with suitable amphiphilicity for stabilizing emulsions with multiple compartments, such as water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) or oil-in-water-in-oil (o/w/o) double emulsions. In one example of such work, Zhu et al.[109] synthesized poly(2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEA) microgel particles for fabricating a high internal phase emulsion with the double emulsion morphology via a simple one-step emulsification method. A survey of the literature shows that food-grade or naturally derived colloidal particles such as cellulose, gelatin, and proteins have been widely extracted or modified for the preparation of Pickering emulsions, particularly for HIPEs. By contrast, investigations of the use of formulations based on Pickering emulsion in cosmetics have been rarely reported. Although emulsification technology is widely used in cream, lotion, foundation, and other cosmetic dispersions, the majority of the emulsion-based products are stabilized by surfactants. The use of Pickering emulsion formulations for cosmetic applications in order to avoid the skin irritation and sensitization issues caused by surfactants should be a promising concept for future research, particularly due to the large size of the cosmetics market.
