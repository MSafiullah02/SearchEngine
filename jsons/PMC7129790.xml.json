Sequencing of quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDR) showed that strains with a reduced susceptibility to C of MIC 1 mg/L have a single mutation in gyrA and strains with full resistance to C of MIC >8 mg/L have a double mutations in gyrA and single mutation in parC. The resistance genes confers G resistance were aac(3\u2032)-IIc (93%), aac(6/)-Ib (66%) and ant(2\u2033)-1a (7%). The prevalence of aph(3)-Ia in K resistant strains was 83%.

The contribution of non-albicans Candida spp. including C. tropicalis to invasive infections is rising, yet little is known of their molecular epidemiology. Therefore, effective typing systems are required for tracing epidemiological distribution patterns. In addition to restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA (REAG) followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), different amplification-based methods were studied: Arbitrarily primed (AP)-PCR under low-stringency conditions with a set of 38 different lOmer arbitrary oligonucleotides (G + C content: 30\u201390%), interrepeat (IR)-PCR based on micro- and minisatellite sequences and eucaryotic telomeric motifs using eight different primers. These results were compared with those obtained by phenotyping the isolates with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). For fingerprinting, 60 C. tropicalis reference strains and clinical isolates from different European and Asian centers were included into the study. The rank order of discriminatory ability among the genotyping methods was as follows: REAG using BssH II >> AP-PCR > IR-PCR. In contrast to other restriction enzymes used, BssH II revealed a series of distinct bands in the region from 100\u2013300 bp to approximately 2\u20133 kb. Regarding AP-PCR fingerprinting, random primers with a G + C content of 50% showed the best discriminatory power if prolonged ramp times (5 min) were applied. In contrast, IR-PCR was shown to be not suitable for genotyping C. tropicalis isolates. Using the \u2018Ward\u2019 algorithm and the first derivates of the spectra, FTIR showed a main branching into two groups, which was further divided in several subgroups depending on the heterogeneity level selected. In general, FTIR was less discriminatory than REAG, but easier to perform. The classifications derived from REAG and FTIR were not completely congruent. Strains representing the same major profile but being epidemiologically unrelated appeared to be widespread in several centres included. These findings indicate that REAG followed by PFGE is the most useful molecular method for the investigation of inter-strain variation within the species C. tropicalis. Dependent upon primer design, AP-PCR may offer a fairly well alternative molecular fingerprinting method. In addition, the whole-organism fingerprinting by FTIR provides a tool with sufficient resolving power to distinguish isolates of this Candida species.",

Voriconazole has a high oral bioavailability and is therefore promising for outpatient treatment. It is well tolerated, but one noncomparative study reported (mild) cutaneous side-effects in 8.6% of the patients. Case 1, a man (24 years) with chronic granulomatous disease was diagnosed with probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis according to the EORTC/MSG definitions. Outpatient treatment with oral voriconazole (200 mg BID) was started and the patient improved. After 8 weeks, he developed profound erythema in sun-exposed areas (face, hands). Voriconazole was stopped and the erythema resolved within 2 weeks. Six weeks later the patient relapsed. Voriconazole was reinstituted. Despite protective measures, he redeveloped profound skin erythema and friability in sun-exposed areas after 4 weeks. After 6 weeks, lesions evolved to desquamation and small ulcers at the hands. After 8 weeks, the patient had large areas with bulla, desquamation and superficial ulcerations on lips, face and hands. Voriconazole was switched to itraconazole oral solution and all lesions healed within 1 week. Case 2 (man, 52 years, diabetes mellitus) underwent aortobifemoral vascular grafting. He was reoperated for thrombotic problems. Multiple cultures of the explanted graft yielded Aspergillus fumigatus. The vascular graft infection was complicated with acro-ileiitis and arthritis of the right knee and ankle. Amphotericin B was given for 1 month. Thereafter the patient was discharged with oral voriconazole (200 mg BID). After 2 months, asymptomatic hyperpigmentation in sun-exposed areas was noticed. After 20 weeks small vesicles appeared in sun exposed areas (face, neck, arms and legs). The vesicles evolved to bulla (diameter 1\u20132 cm) and ruptured after a few days. Crustae were formed and the lesions healed in 2 weeks. New lesions continued to appear while old lesions were healing. Voriconazole was switched to itraconazole oral solution and all lesions resolved within 2 weeks. Discussion: Skin reactions, mainly rash, pruritus and phototoxic induced erythema, are known but mostly mild side-effects of voriconazole. More severe facial erythema and cheilitis were reported in five patients. We reported severe late-onset phototoxic skin reactions in two patients. Further postmarketing surveillance on the incidence and impact of these late-onset cutaneous side-effects is warranted.",

In the C-terminal part of StkP we identified four repeats with the PASTA signature (penicillin-binding protein and serine/threonine kinase associated domain). It has been proposed that this domain could bind unlinked peptidoglycan and act as its sensor. Thus, StkP might be involved in cell-wall biosynthesis through interaction of their PASTA domains with cell wall components. The PASTA domain is also an important antibiotic resistance determinant in the penicillin-binding proteins.",

The first step in this method is to perform a PCR comprising both regions to be sequenced. In the PCR, heat-inactivated streptococcal suspension may be used as a sample. After checking the presence of the PCR products on an agarose gel, sequencing is carried out.

            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new respiratory infection that has been reported in several countries around the world. It is recognised as a new type of atypical pneumonia that infects the lungs, caused by a new strain of Coronavirus, SARS-CoV. SARS has killed at least 770 people and infected more than 8500 worldwide since the outbreak in China's Guangdong province late 2001. Molecular amplification has emerged as a powerful technology for the specific and sensitive detection of such a virus. However, the use of this new technology in routine laboratories requires a rapid, easy-to-perform and affordable detection method. Analysis on agarose gel is time-consuming and cannot exclude false-positive products while alternate specific detection methods are time and labour-consuming (ELISA) or require very expensive equipment (real-time amplification). In order to perform an easy and specific detection of amplified gene products, we set up and tested a new detection technology: oligochromatography. An internal probe to the nucleic acid sequence to be detected is conjugated to collodal gold particles. A conjugate pad containing this dried conjugate is placed overlapping the membrane of a chromatographic stick where anti-hapten antibodies are coated. Amplification is carried out with hapten-labelled primer(s). Detection is performed by dipping an oligochromatographic stick in the amplified solution. While migrating in the stick, amplicons react with the colloidal gold-conjuguated probe. The probe-amplicon complexes accumulate on the line where the anti-hapten antibody is coated, giving rise to a visible red line in <5 min. A highly sensitive RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV was developed. It contains an internal control allowing to test for the absence of PCR inhibitors in the amplified material. Detect-ability of this RT-PCR coupled to oligochromatographic detection was compared with agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. Oligochromatography shall probably become the best way to specifically detect nucleic acid sequences after a molecular amplification process. It is rapid, specific, easy to handle, and does not require any specific equipment.",

All sera were examined in the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test according to the manufacturers' instructions: patient's age and sex were also recorded. Referral forms were reviewed for the first 1000 consecutive patients with positive serology and from the clinical details each was classified as a case of: Cat Scratch Disease (evidence of lymph node involvement and/or histological evidence), Bacillary Angiomatosis/peliosis, Bartonella endocarditis, PUO, other recognised manifestation (e.g. ophthalmic bartonellosis) or insufficient details.

Laboratory diagnosis is crucial to increase global preparedness to such an event.

A stool specimen of the 2-year-old brother of the patient and two faecal samples of two cattle (one calf and one bull) also identified SF STEC O157. All four STEC isolates carried the virulence genes stx 2, eaeA and hlyA, and were characterised by automated ribotyping (using EcoRI as restriction enzyme) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE; with XbaI as restriction enzyme).

Molecular analysis showed that six isolates carried a CTX-M-type gene, whereas most of the remaining 22 carried the SHV gene. Notably, two isolates were suspected to produce MBL since they had EDTA-inhibitable carbapenemase activity. In the latter strains, RFLP-multiplex PCR indicated that a VIM-1-like gene was present. CTX-M and VIM determinants were carried on plasmids that were transferred to E. coli recipients by conjugation.",

These observations raise the possibility that this P. aeruginosa strain originates in Greece, and has been imported to Hungary by a human carrier.

PCR mapping experiments suggest that this strain carries a class 1 integron with only two resistance gene cassettes in its variable region.

Sequencing showed the presence of an OXA-40 enzyme and analysis of PFGE revealed that these isolates belong to a single clone. Resistance to all beta-lactams and variable susceptibility to amikacin and tobramycin was a common feature of this clone. Macrorestriction analysis of other 57 imipenem-resistant isolates demonstrated the simultaneous dissemination of another clonal type, which differs also in the susceptibility patterns.

New alternative technique based on impedimetric procedure (Bactometer BioMerieux, Vitek System, USA), provide possibilities to reduce this time to several hours. The procedure utilises the capability of an instrument to detect bacterial growth in sample by measurement of media conductivity changes. The impedance detection time is inversely proportional to the number of micro-organisms present at initial inoculum and it correlates with the original bacteria count in the sample as determined by standard plate count method.

Most Enterobacteriaceae possess a chromosomally encoded AmpC beta-lactamase that is expressed at low level in the absence of an inducer. Mutations in regulatory genes result in high-level production. An IE could be due to selection of derepressed mutants or cells with decreased outer membrane permeability. IE might be regulated by a quorum sensing mechanism via an extracellular signal accumulating with increasing cell count. Many studies referred to the IE in relation to the quantity of beta-lactamase, but this was not quantitatively proven for AmpC enzymes.
