            "text": "The newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), caused an epidemic during the period February to June, 2003, which spread to 32 countries infecting more than 8000 people of which 900 died (Pearson, 2003). This disease was typically characterized by fever, malaise, rigor, headache and dyspnea, followed by severe respiratory failure, which led to a 15% fatality rate among infected patients (Booth et al., 2003). The pathological analysis of the lung tissue from the deceased patients revealed severe lesions of the pulmonary alveolar, flooding of the alveolar lumina with proteinaceous fluid and necrosis of the bronchiolar epithelium (Peiris et al., 2003). The extent of tissue lesions usually depends on cell damage caused mainly by the virus (Lee et al., 2003), or, by the immune cytotoxic effect against the viral antigens (Tyler and Fields, 1990). To date, no data strongly supports the idea that the pathological effect of the SARS coronavirus are due to autoimmune damage against the cells infected by the virus, though clinical treatment indicates that corticosteroids can inhibit the development of this disease. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that the cytopathic effect produced by SARS-CoV in alveolar cells and bronchiolar epithelium is probably the main factor causing the severe pathology. However, there is insufficient data to interpret the replication process of SARS-CoV in cells, and the observation of the cellular morphology change by SARS-CoV in vitro only exhibits the cytopathic effect including rounded, swollen cellular organelle, like Golgi sacs, and numerous smooth-membraned vacuoles in the cytoplasm (Ksiazek et al., 2003). These observations suggest that the cytopathic effect caused by the replication of SARS-CoV in cells could be involved. In this case, the SARS-CoV or the components of this virus are possibly interacting directly or indirectly on a specific cellular organelle during the virus replication in cells. To investigate the pathological mechanism of SARS-CoV during its replication in cell culture, we investigated several non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV, which are produced by the 3CLpro cleaving pp1a/pp1ab in the SARS-CoV's infection (Thiel et al., 2003). The results, interestingly, suggested that the non-structural protein 10 (nsp10) could be involved in the pathological function of SARS-CoV in cells. Using the yeast trap method (Fields and Sternglanz, 1994), the synthesized gene of SARS-CoV nsp10 was used to screen the specific genes of proteins probably interacting with this protein in a human embryo lung cDNA library. Surprisingly, the results indicated that apart from the two subunits of cellular RNA polymerase B complex, BTF3 and ATF5, this SARS-CoV non-structural protein 10 was able to interact specifically with the NADH 4L subunit and cytochrome oxidase II. This result was also supported by the pull-down detection of nsp10-GST fusion protein and Western blotting with antibody against cytochrome oxidase. To further investigate the contribution of this interaction to the cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV, a detection series of mitochondrial function and the activity of the oxido-reductase system in the human embryo lung fibroblast transfected with the nsp10 gene was performed. The results suggested that the interaction of this protein with NADH and cytochrome oxidase II in cells infected by the Coronavirus 229E interrupted the physiological function of mitochondria and caused severe damage to the cells. The results obtained in this work could provide some data to explain the possible mechanism of the SARS-CoV infection, which causes more severe damage in lung tissue than infection with other coronaviruses.",

After screening twice using SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/+25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) plates, five clones were identified as corresponding to nsp10. Among them, one gene of unknown function warranted further investigation. The other proteins encoded by the other four genes were NADH 4L subunit, cytochrome oxidase II, RNA polymerase B transcription factor 3 and activation transcription factor 5, through comparison with gene sequences in GenBank. To define the binding specificity of the nsp10 protein to these five proteins, a yeast-mating assay was conducted, which indicated that the nsp10 protein had a higher affinity to the NADH 4L subunit and cytochrome oxidase II (Fig. 1\n). As we know, the SARS-CoV non-structural protein 10, formerly known as a growth-factor-like protein, exhibits 55\u201358% homology with other coronaviruses. However, little is known about its function in the coronavirus replication process (Marra et al., 2003). Some data suggest that it could be part of the viral replicase polyprotein (Thiel et al., 2003, Anand et al., 2003). However, the possible interaction between this protein and the NADH subunit 4L and cytochrome oxidase II did provide a clue for further understanding its contribution in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.",

The activity of cytochrome oxidase was detected at different time points after transfection. The results indicated a decrease of this activity in the cells transfected by the pcDNA-nsp10 plasmid compared with the control cells (Fig. 3a).

The cytopathological analysis indicated an obvious cellular edema, severe vacuolar degeneration with the large nuclear, chromosome condensation, the necrosis of some cellular apparatus, and the damage of mitochondria or endoplasm membrane when viewed through the electron microscope (Fig. 4b). This was also supported by the observation of the stained cells by the HE method (data not shown).

In the latter time of the infection (72\u201396 h after post-infection of Coronavirus 229E), the classic cytopathic effect appeared in the control cells.

            "text": "As a new species of coronavirus, the SARS-CoV should have a similar method of viral replication as other coronaviruses. In fact, infection with SARS-CoV causes a severe pathological process with its own specific and unknown mechanism, which can bring about a severe respiratory syndrome in patients (Ng et al., 2004). This clinical characterization suggests two possibilities in the pathogenesis of SARS. One is immune pathogenesis, in which the damage of alveolar cells and bronchiolar epithelium could be caused by SARS-CoV specific cytotoxic T-cells. However, the data reported to date does not provide strong evidence to support this possibility. The results obtained from the SARS animal model also indicate that no obvious lymphocytes accumulate in the lung tissue of those infected by SARS-CoV (Fouchier et al., 2003). The other possibility is that the extensive cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV leads to a wider necrosis in lung tissue and impairs the respiratory function. This study seems to support this hypothesis. However, some previous data indicated that the protein component of coronavirus targets the cellular apparatus, like the Golgi complex for releasing virus particles (Emily and Machamer, 2002). The SARS-CoV non-structural protein 10, as it is produced from the viral polyprotein pp1a/pp1ab by 3CLpro cleavage during SARS-CoV infection in cells, should theoretically function in the viral replication while interacting with the specific cellular protein. The yeast two-hybrid system analysis of the human embryo lung tissue DNA library identified potential targeting proteins of the nsp10, including the proteins involved in the cellular transcription process and the enzyme components of the oxido-reductase system in mitochondria. This result suggests that the nsp10 protein could affect the activities of NADH and cytochrome oxidase II via a direct interaction while being involved in viral replication. In this investigation, the localization test of the nsp10 protein fusing with the GFP fluorescence protein also showed that the nsp10 protein was accumulated as a cluster in the cytoplasm. This illustrates, to some extent, that the nsp10 protein attaches to a specific cellular apparatus in the cytoplasm compared with the localization results of mitochondria with rhodamine-123 staining. The pull-down test and Western blot with antibody against the cytochrome oxidase complex also suggest the interaction of nsp10 and oxido-reductase system in vivo. The most important evidence is the change of two physiological indicators of human embryo lung fibroblast transfected with the nsp10 gene, which include the decreased tendency of cytochrome oxidase activity of the transfected cells, and a loss in the cellular inner mitochondrial membrane potential exhibited by the decreased rhodamine-123 fluorescence intensity. Therefore, we could infer that the nsp10 protein might contribute to the severe damage of the cells infected by the SARS-CoV with its effect on the enzyme, like NADH or cytochrome oxidase of the mitochondria. Depending upon this hypothesis, we further investigated the possible biological properties of the nsp10 protein in the replication of Coronavirus 229E. This virus is able to replicate and cause cytopathic effect in KMB-17 fibroblasts. Interestingly, these results revealed that the expression of the nsp10 protein in the cells enhanced the cytopathic effect of Coronavirus 229E. The morphological observations indicated that the cells transfected by the pcDNA-nsp10, in which the expression of the nsp10 protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis, appeared to show a severe cytopathic effect, while in contrast, the control cells transfected by the pcDNA-Vp3 did not show any obvious cytopathic effect within 24\u201372 h after infection with the virus, This suggested that the cytopathic effect was unrelated to the accumulation of the expressed exogenous protein in the cells. Titration of the virus harvested from the cells at different time points demonstrated the obvious difference between the experimental sample and the control cells. There was little increase in titre of virus in cells transfected by the nsp10 gene, while the virus titre in the control cells transfected only with the pcDNA-Vp3 plasmid had increased by about 2\u20133 log. This result seems to contradict the obvious cytopathic effect of the cells transfected with the nsp10 gene. However, as the extensive cytopathic effect appeared rapidly, we could deduce that the blocking of virus replication in these cells is due to damage to the cellular apparatus probably caused by the nsp10 protein, and the possible interaction of nsp10 protein and BTF3 or ATF5 indicated in yeast trap test.",
