            "text": "Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is common and several mechanisms, including elevated pulmonary vascular tone, sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction and positive-pressure ventilation, can combine to induce RV failure [1]. Thus, assessment of RV function is part of ARDS patient care [2]. Cardiac MRI allows highly accurate and reliable measurement of RV ejection fraction and is currently the gold standard imaging technique for RV assessment [3]. However, echocardiography is more practical in the unstable patient because it can be performed quickly at the bedside in a safer environment. There is currently significant interest for echocardiographic strain measurement derived from 2D speckle tracking imaging (STE), as it provides an objective quantification of myocardial mechanical function with unrivalled sensitivity. Hence, RV strain is now recommended as part of any comprehensive multiparametric assessment of RV function [4, 5]. However, data are scarce regarding its usefulness in mechanically ventilated patients in general and in ARDS patients in particular.",

We recorded \u2265 3 consecutive cardiac cycles, encompassing approximately one respiratory cycle. Three RV walls were analysed: lateral and septal walls from 4-chamber view and inferior wall from 2-chamber view (obtained by rotating the probe counter-clockwise with an angle of 90\u00b0 from the 4-chamber view focused on the RV). Each wall was divided into three segments (basal, mid-ventricular, and apical). Longitudinal systolic strain (LSS) is calculated as the percentage of systolic shortening of a myocardial wall from base to apex, while longitudinal strain rate (LSR) is the rate of this shortening. Peak LSS and LSR were measured using the Q-Analysis add-on included in EchoPAC software. The endocardial border of the RV wall was manually traced using a point-to-click approach. An automatic epicardial border tracing was then generated by the software, thus creating a region of interest that could be manually adjusted to the myocardial wall thickness to encompass the endocardium and the epicardium (usually 5 mm). The pericardium was excluded from the region of interest. For each segment, LSS and LSR were calculated as the average of both endocardial and epicardial layers. Tracking quality was automatically scored as either acceptable or unacceptable and further manually validated based on traces appearance. Segments without adequate tracking were excluded from further analysis. Global LSS and LSR were calculated as the average of septal, lateral and inferior LSS and LSR values, respectively. For each patient, STE-derived parameters were repeated and averaged on three consecutive cycles by two operators unaware of the measurements of the other operator.",

Between-group differences were assessed using the unpaired Student\u2019s t test or Mann\u2013Whitney U test for normally and non-normally distributed continuous variables, respectively, and by Chi-square test for categorical data. The association of STE-derived variables with conventional RV parameters was assessed by use of a Pearson correlation analysis. As there is no gold-standard parameter for RV assessment by echocardiography, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the diagnostic performance of STE-derived parameters in discriminating abnormal RV function among several conventional parameters using previously published threshold values. Interobserver reproducibility of STE-derived parameters was assessed in all patients. Intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficients were used to explore reproducibility of echocardiography measurements (single measurement, absolute agreement, 2-way mixed-effects model). Kaplan\u2013Meier curves were plotted to assess survival and time to weaning from MV at day 28 depending on the presence or absence of RV dysfunction and were compared by means of the log-rank test. To show a sensitivity and a specificity of 0.90 (marginal error 0.1), considering a prevalence of right ventricular dysfunction of 30%, a minimum sample size of 49 patients was required to provide the study with 80% power and 95% confidence level.

RV global LSS provided the highest diagnostic performance to discriminate between patients with TAPSE < 12 mm versus > 12 mm (area under the ROC curve (AUROC) 0.905; 95% CI [0.805\u20131.00]; p = 0.002). A threshold of \u2212 13.7% differentiated patients with TAPSE < 12 mm versus > 12 mm with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 83%. Whichever RV wall considered, strain parameters performed better in classifying patients with TAPSE < 12 mm than any other abnormal conventional parameter (S\u2032, RVFAC or RV dilation plus at least another abnormal conventional parameter. Secondly, we repeated these analyses while using widely used cut-off thresholds derived from large cohorts of non-ventilated patients (EACVI/ASE guidelines, i.e. TAPSE < 17 mm and S\u2032 < 9.5) [4]. Once again, RV global LSS provided the highest diagnostic performance to discriminate between patients with normal vs abnormal TAPSE (i.e. > vs < 17 mm) (AUROC 0.759; 95% CI [0.614\u20130.904]; p = 0.002) (Additional file 1: Table S4).\n\n",

Some explanations could be a greater heterogeneity in our patients\u2019 presentation or a lower mortality rate. Either way, it is unlikely that one single measurement at one time-point could accurately predict long-term outcomes in the complex setting of critical care. STE has the distinctive ability to detect subtle changes in systolic function. Thus, as discussed above, using these highly sensitive tools to serially assess RV function during a short therapeutic intervention could be more useful. For instance, RV lateral LSS has already been studied during recruitment manoeuvres in a large animal pre-clinical model and in ARDS patients [11, 18]. Both these studies found significant impairment in RV lateral LSS that were not detected by conventional parameters while increasing PEEP levels.",

However, TAPSE has been shown to be correlated with left ventricular function, thus reflecting not only the presence of right, but also left ventricular failure [19]. Moreover, we predefined a very low abnormal cut-off value of < 12 mm. It induced a very low number of patients with abnormal TAPSE (n = 6/48), which is known to lead to the \u201crare event problem\u201d where specificity disproportionately drives accuracy [20].
