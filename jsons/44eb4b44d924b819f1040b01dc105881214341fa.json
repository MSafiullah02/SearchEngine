            "text": "Purpose Oestrogen receptor \u03b2 is believed to exert a cardioprotective effect against ischaemic injury. Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying its protective action remains to be fully elucidated. Recently, increased attention has been focused on Notch1 signalling for ameliorating cardiac ischaemic injury. Here, we hypothesised that oestrogen receptor \u03b2 activation attenuates myocardial infarction (MI)-induced cardiac damage by modulating the Notch1 signalling pathway. Methods Male C57BL/6 mice were used to establish an MI model through the ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. Two chemical drugs, 2,3-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-lalanyl]-s-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), a specific inhibitor of Notch1 signalling) were administered via intraperitoneal injection to change oestrogen receptor \u03b2 and Notch1 activities. Immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) assessment and echocardiography were used in this study to analyse cardiac oxidative stress, apoptosis, infraction volume, fibrosis and cardiac function. Results DPN-mediated oestrogen receptor \u03b2 activation effectively protected cardiomyocytes from MI-induced oxidative damage and apoptosis. Furthermore, oestrogen receptor \u03b2 activation reduced the infarct size and lowered the levels of myocardial enzymes in the serum, thereby leading to greater overall cardiac function improvement. Ischaemic injury-induced myocardial fibrosis was attenuated by oestrogen receptor \u03b2 activation. Nevertheless, all of these cardioprotective effects of oestrogen receptor \u03b2 activation were almost abrogated by DAPT administration, i.e. DAPT attenuated the anti-oxidative and antiapoptotic effects and the decrease in infarct and fibrotic areas and reversed cardiac functional recovery. The levels of phospho-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and phospho-protein kinase B (Akt) were increased after DPN administration, and this change was reversed after DAPT was administered. Conclusions All of these new findings indicate that oestrogen receptor \u03b2 activation is effective in ameliorating MI-induced cardiac dysfunction by enhancing Notch1 signalling and that PI3K/Akt signalling is the downstream mediator.",

            "text": "To date, four Notch signalling receptors (Notch1-4) and five Notch ligands (Delta-like 1, 3 and 4 and Jagged 1-2) have been identified in mammals [16] . Notch1-4 belong to a family of transmembrane receptor proteins that are pivotal components of the Notch signalling pathway. The activation of Notch signalling receptors releases a signal form of the intracellular domain of Notch (NICD). In canonical Notch signalling, the NICD is relocated to the nucleus, where it modulates the transcription of several genes by triggering allosteric changes that facilitate the displacement of transcriptional repressors and the consequent activation of downstream effector proteins [17] . The Notch1 signalling pathway has been demonstrated to perform an important function in a series of cellular processes, such as differentiation, proliferation and cell death [18, 19] . In recent years, many studies have revealed that the Notch1 signalling pathway plays a regulatory role in cardiac diseases such as MI and heart failure [20, 21] . Although one study showed that oestrogen receptor \u03b2dependent Notch1 activation can protect against tumour necrosis factor \u03b1-induced vascular endothelium apoptosis, the cardioprotective effect of Notch1 via oestrogen receptor \u03b2 activation has not yet been fully characterised [22] . Therefore, on the basis of previous research, this study aimed to test the involvement of Notch1 signalling in the cardioprotective effect of oestrogen receptor \u03b2 activation. In addition, we investigated the possible involvement of downstream phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling in this process.",

The depth of anaesthesia was deemed adequate when there were neither motor nor autonomic responses to nose pinching. The mice were kept warm with heat lamps and heating pads. The chest was opened with a horizontal incision through the muscle between the ribs at the third intercostal space, and ischaemia was implemented by ligating the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery using a 7-0 nylon suture. After that, the incision was closed, and the wound was cleaned and disinfected. Shamoperated mice underwent the same procedure, with the exception of the left coronary artery ligation. Functional observations (respiration, heartbeat and neural reflexes) were performed daily on all mice after the operation [25] .",

Timeline of experimental protocols was presented in SFig. 1. DPN and DAPT were initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and then diluted in sterile saline (final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration < 2%). The doses of DPN and DAPT were chosen according to previous studies [13, 26, 27] . Post-infarction remodelling has been peremptorily divided into an early phase (within 72 h) and a late phase. In the early phase post-MI, we examined the oxidative stress, the number of apoptotic cells, the myocardial enzyme release and the cardiac-infarcted volume. In the late phase, we evaluated the cardiac fibrotic areas and the heart function [28] . We executed the animals by using carbon dioxide anaesthesia. When the mice were anesthetised, they were killed by cervical dislocation. Of note, to avoid causing pain, the flow rate of carbon dioxide was 10-30% of the chamber volume per minute. Once each assessed mouse was killed, the hearts were carefully removed [25] . For western blot analysis and Elisa, the whole heart tissue was collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to flush out residual blood before homogenisation. For histological assessment and infarct size measurement, heart ventricles from the ligature to the apex were rapidly isolated and rinsed thoroughly with PBS before being fixed or sliced.",

Studies in recent years have revealed the protective effect of oestrogen against multiple cardiovascular diseases, and further investigation has proven that the protective function of oestrogen can be mainly attributed to its receptors (oestrogen receptor \u03b1 and oestrogen receptor \u03b2) [35, 36] . The cardioprotective actions of oestrogen receptor \u03b2, particularly in females, have been reported in other studies and involve the ability to activate the NO pathway in endothelial cells, reduce oxidative stress, alleviate vascular inflammation and promote angiogenesis [37] . Many current studies use oestrogen receptor \u03b2 transgenic mice to investigate oestrogen receptor \u03b2-mediated cardioprotection [9, 14] . Nonetheless, transgenic technology is far from clinical reality. Furthermore, in our experiments, no change was observed in the expression of cardiac oestrogen receptor \u03b2 either before or after MI induction. This phenomenon may indicate that the specific and potent activation of oestrogen receptor \u03b2, rather than a simple increase in the number of its molecules, is what is required for the treatment of MI injury. In recent years, with the technological development of the synthesis of chemical compounds, many studies have used DPN as a specific oestrogen receptor \u03b2 agonist [13, 26] . Therefore, in the current study, we determined the role of oestrogen receptor \u03b2 in MI-induced cardiac injury by means of its specific agonist DPN. DPN treatment showed cardioprotective effects in our MI model, as evidenced by the attenuation of the following: increased oxidative stress, the increased number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes, myocardial enzyme release and the expansion of the infarct and fibrotic areas. It also enhanced myocardial angiogenesis and post-ischaemic cardiac functional recovery.",

The Notch signalling pathway is highly conserved and controls cell fate throughout life. Recent studies have revealed that the Notch1 cascade performs a key function in the heart during development and disease [17] . Notch1 signalling is absent under normal conditions, but it can be activated in various tissues under pathological conditions, such as ischaemic injury and cancer [38, 39] . One study has proven that Notch1 signalling exerts a regulatory effect during cardiac damage and preserves cardiac function after ischaemic insult [6] . Nevertheless, despite the advantages mentioned above, how exactly Notch1 exerts its protective effects remains unclear. In particular, we recently observed that Notch1 oestrogen receptor \u03b2 crosstalk is involved in the protection of the endothelium by oestrogen during TNF\u03b1-induced inflammation [22] . Moreover, in the present study, we noted that NICD expression increased after MI injury and increased further after stimulation with DPN. Therefore, we propose that Notch1 signalling may play a key role in oestrogen receptor \u03b2-mediated cardioprotection after cardiac ischaemic damage.",

Thus, to further elucidate the involvement of Notch1 signalling in the cardioprotective action of oestrogen receptor \u03b2, we decided to test its specific inhibitor DAPT. As a result, we observed that DAPT significantly attenuated the protective action of oestrogen receptor \u03b2 against MI, as evidenced by impaired recovery of postischaemic cardiac function, a reversal of the decrease in the levels of myocardial enzymes in the serum, the prevention of myocardial angiogenesis and the restoration of myocardial oxidation, apoptotic stress and fibrosis. Therefore, we seem to be the first to report that the upregulation of NICD can at least partially explain the beneficial effects of oestrogen receptor \u03b2 activation in our experimental settings.",

In addition, it has been proven that the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway is activated in response to the chronic upregulation of oestrogen receptor \u03b2 [42] . Furthermore, Notch1 has been demonstrated to modulate the PI3K/Akt axis by regulating PTEN expression in various tissues [43] . These observations prompted us to investigate the relationship between Notch1, PI3K/Akt signalling and Fig. 7 Effects of 2,3-bis(4hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) and N-[N-(3,5difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-sphenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) on the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. a Western blot analysis of the expression of the intracellular domain of Notch (NICD) and of PI3K and Akt phosphorylation. b-f Analysis of the levels of NICD, p-PI3K, p-Akt, PI3K and Akt.

As a result, we revealed that oestrogen receptor \u03b2 activation significantly increased the expression of NICD and promoted the phosphorylation of proteins in the PI3K/Akt pathway. To elucidate the relationship between NICD expression and the PI3K/Akt pathway during oestrogen receptor \u03b2 activation, we blocked Notch1 signalling via its specific inhibitor DAPT. It is noteworthy that the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt was effectively suppressed by the inhibition of Notch1 signalling regardless of whether DPN was administered. Therefore, we determined the relationship between oestrogen receptor \u03b2, Notch1 and the PI3K/Akt signalling cascades by confirming that the cardioprotective influence of oestrogen receptor \u03b2 is largely due to its ability to activate Notch1 signal transduction (i.e. NICD release and translocation to the nucleus) and subsequently, to enhance the PI3K/ Akt pathway.",
