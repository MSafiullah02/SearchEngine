In our patient, the RNA load in the feces on day 4 was only one log lower than in the bronchoalveolar lavage, unlikely a result of spillover from the respiratory tract. Fecal secretion of HRV suggesting enteric infection has been demonstrated before.19, 20 This could possibly be a result of temporarily low stomach acid.",
