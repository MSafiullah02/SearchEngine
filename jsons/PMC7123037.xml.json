            "text": "The current Sapelovirus taxonomy is the result of efforts from the picorna study group and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) Executive Committee (www.picornastudygroup.com) that are contributing their expertise to provide a classification scheme that is supported by verifiable data and expert consensus. The genus Sapelovirus contains three species, namely Avian sapelovirus (ASV), Sapelovirus A (SV-A, porcine) and Sapelovirus B (SV-B, simian) (ICTV 10th report, https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/positive-sense-rnaviruses/picornavirales/w/picornaviridae/701/genus-sapelovirus). ASV and SV-A consist of only a single antigenically heterogenous serotype, respectively, known as ASV-1 and PSV-1. However, SSVs are highly divergent and are classified into three genetically defined Sapelovirus types as SSV-1 to SSV-3. PSV (strain csh) was first isolated from China in 2011 (Lan et al. 2011). As on date, 50 complete genomic sequences of PSV strains have been published from China, South Korea, Japan, Germany, France, India and the United Kingdom (Lan et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2012; Schock et al. 2014; Son et al. 2014; Ray et al. 2018; Piorkowski et al. 2018; Bai et al. 2018). Different virus strains exhibit affinity towards different target organs, as the PSV-csh strain (China, Shanghai) and PSV-G5 (the United Kingdom) affect mostly nervous system (Lan et al. 2011; Schock et al. 2014), whereas strains like KS0515, KS04105 and KS0552179 and Chinese PSV strain YC2011 are associated with diarrhoea. Notably, PSV-csh is a diarrhoeagenic strain that leads to respiratory distress before the onset of polioencephalomyelitis in infected animals (Lan et al. 2011).",

The complete genome size of the virus is 7.5\u20138.3 kb, coding a single polyprotein which is further cleaved post-translationally by virus-encoded proteinases into 12 individual proteins, viz. a leader protein (L), four structural proteins (VP1-4) and seven non-structural proteins (2A-2C, 3A-3D). The deduced polyproteins of the Sapelovirus range from 2322 to 2521 amino acids (aa). The layout of a complete genome of PSV (strain V13) with the nucleotide length of each protein is depicted in Fig. 14.1. PSVs have unique L and 2A protein (Krumbholz et al. 2002). Though the exact function of these two proteins is not known yet, both are presumed to be a protease. All three Sapeloviruses contain Internal Ribosomal Entry Site (IRES) type IV. ASVs have the longer L protein (451 aa) compared to PSV (84 aa) and SSV (88 aa). Regarding 2A protein, ASVs have very small protein (12 aa) whereas PSV and SSV have 226 aa and 302 aa, respectively. A species demarcation criteria is followed for the genus Sapelovirus that is founded on above 70% aa identity in the polyprotein, greater than 64% aa identity in P1 (VP4, VP2, VP3, VP1), greater than 70% aa identity in 2C + 3CD, a similar genome base composition which varies by no more than 1% and a common genome organisation (ICTV 10th report, 2018).",

The countries that confirmed the presence of PSVs are shown in Fig. 14.2 (Forman et al. 1982; La Rosa et al. 2006; Buitrago et al. 2010; Lan et al. 2011; Shan et al. 2011; Cano-Gomez et al. 2013; Schock et al. 2014; Donin et al. 2014, 2015). The most immunodominant protein VP1 in the capsid of PSVs is used for estimating the divergence among the strains. Though only a single type of PSV-1 is present, fewer similarities are observed between PSV strains from different geographical regions. Phylogenetic analysis based on VP1 gene sequences shows that PSVs are distributed in different clusters depending upon the country of origin. Both full-length (855 bp) and partial-length (544 bp) VP1 genes have been used for the analysis of PSV diversity. The analysis based on VP1 sequences by SplitsTree4 software segregates three species within the genus Sapelovirus (Fig. 14.3) in three different clusters. Variations within PSV isolates are quite evident that indicates that several PSVs are circulating all over the world, and they are different from each other based on VP1 sequence. Studies from China reveal that recombinations occur between PSV strains, which further contribute to the antigenic diversity among PSVs. Recently, identification and genomic characterisation of Sapelovirus have been documented from France and India (Ray et al. 2018; Piorkowski et al. 2018; Kumari et al. 2019). A Chinese study reported the recombination hotspot near 3\u2032 of the VP1 gene and showed six interclades within PSV recombinant strains (Yang et al. 2017).",

Symptomatic manifestations are mainly neurological, which include spinal cord damage, ataxia, mental dullness, paresis, paralysis and a decreased response to environmental stimuli. Polioencephalitis in grower pigs is characterised by ataxia and paraparesis. Experimental infection of polioencephalitis has been documented in 50\u201360-day-old grower pigs. A novel PSV isolate from the United States was found to be associated with typical polioencephalomyelitis (Arruda et al. 2016). Gastroenteritis and respiratory distress may also be seen with PSV-induced polioencephalomyelitis (Lan et al. 2011). Intravaginal inoculation at day 15 of gestation causes early embryonic death and foetal resorption, but when inoculated at day 30, it results in a significant increase in foetal death (Huang et al. 1980). PSV is also detected from intestinal contents of stillbirth animals from Indian pig population, which suggests the transplacental transmission of the virus (Kumari et al. 2019).",

            "text": "Routine laboratory diagnosis of PSVs mainly includes cell culture isolation and virus genome characterisation. Pig kidney cell-derived cell lines including EFN, PK-15, IBRS-2 and LLC-PK are susceptible to PSV with a cytopathic effect (CPE) in these cells (Sozzi et al. 2010; Lan et al. 2011). Additionally, monkey kidney (Vero) and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21) are also susceptible to PSVs where a CPE characterised by cell shrinkage, rounding and detachment is commonly seen after 3\u20135 passages. Recently, a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, PLC/PRF/5, is normally used to isolate the hepatitis E virus, from swine faecal specimens serendipitously isolated from Japanese PSV strain (Bai et al. 2018). Cultured PSVs are generally identified by using virus neutralisation (VN) (Sozzi et al. 2010) and immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assays (Son et al. 2014). However, these methods are costly, less specific, labour intensive and time consuming. Several molecular methods like reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), nested reverse transcription PCR (nRT-PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR have been developed for PSV detection (Zell et al. 2000; Palmquist et al. 2002; Krumbholz et al. 2003). Table 14.1 depicts the list of assays with target genes and primer sequences used by researchers in detecting PSVs. These molecular methods are specific, sensitive and rapid and do not cross-react with other common pathogens of porcine diseases including pseudorabies virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, porcine parvovirus, porcine coronavirus, porcine reovirus or picorna-like virus (Palmquist et al. 2002). Real-time PCR assays developed for the detection of PSVs from field samples could detect a range of 102\u2013103 copies of DNA (Chen et al. 2014; Kumari et al. 2019). Both these real-time PCR assays utilised the TaqMan chemistry, which is quite specific. Another sensitive diagnostic available for PSV is reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) that was developed by Wang et al. (2014) with a detection limit of ten copies of DNA. All these easy, rapid and sensitive diagnostics will help in better understanding of the epidemiology of PSV and find a better way for prevention.",

A study done on porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) reveals the role of PSV infection in changing the innate immune response pathway (Lan et al. 2013). The study shows both upregulation (e.g. TLR3) and downregulations (e.g. TLR4) of several innate immune system molecules (Lan et al. 2013). Maternal antibodies proved not to be protective in the case of transplacental infection (Huang et al. 1980). Seropositive gilts when inoculated intrauterinely and intravaginally resulted in embryonic and foetal infection (Huang et al. 1980). Though maternal antibody in the colostrums is believed to be protective infections are found in post-weaning animals (Schock et al. 2014). As of now, there is no vaccine available for PSVs.",

However, precise data about the prevalence of PSV infections and the genetic diversity of this virus in pigs and wild boars have been reported only in a limited number of countries. Moreover, the association of co-infections with other enteric pathogens is exactly not known which raises ambiguity in the pathogenic potential of PSVs. Several recent findings on recombination events between PSV strains emphasise to study genetic variability among PSVs.",
