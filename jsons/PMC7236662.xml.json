Those requesting and meeting requirements for medical exemption are reassigned to duties that do not require direct patient care (at no salary change). By increasing the number of isolated reading rooms, reading stations at outpatient facilities, and at-home reading stations, our department offers an opportunity for those high-risk members to remain engaged in the interpretation of diagnostic imaging.
