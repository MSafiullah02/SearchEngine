            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs; family Coronaviridae) are enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses with the largest genomes (25\u201331 kb) among known RNA viruses (de Groot et al., 2011). Based on genome-scale phylogenies the known CoVs are classified into 30 species within four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (ICTV, 2017). Coronaviruses can infect humans, other mammals, and birds, causing respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases of varying severity (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Coronaviruses are well known globally due to the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2002\u20132003 caused by a previously unknown CoV (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). Subsequently, other two human CoVs (NL63 and HKU1) causing respiratory disease were identified (van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005). Strikingly, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) that emerged in 2012 and characterized by a higher mortality than SARS was also caused by a previously unknown CoV (Bermingham et al., 2012, Zaki et al., 2012). The ongoing emergence of these CoVs in humans means that CoVs will likely remain a key public health threat for the foreseeable future.",

            "text": "Since the discovery of SARS-CoV in Himalayan palm civets (Guan et al., 2003), intense effort has been directed toward identifying and characterizing coronaviruses from animals globally. Consequently, a number of CoVs have been identified in a diverse range of vertebrates including domestic and wild mammals, and birds (Poon et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2015, Woo et al., 2012). Bats (order Chiroptera), with more than 1240 species, have remarkable species diversity, and comprise more than 20% of living mammalian species (Nowak, 1994). The discovery of SARS-related CoV in Rhinolophus horseshoe bats in China in 2005 (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005) attracted the global attention to these mammals, such that diverse Alpha- and Beta-CoVs have now been identified in a variety of bats globally over the past decade (Corman et al., 2013, Corman et al., 2014, Corman et al., 2015, Drexler et al., 2014, He et al., 2014, Huang et al., 2016, Smith et al., 2016, Woo et al., 2012). More importantly, due to the close relationship between CoVs in bats and those causing human infections, it is believed that bats are the original source of human CoVs including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2015, Ge et al., 2013, Huynh et al., 2012, Ithete et al., 2013, Tao et al., 2017). Due to their high diversity and biological and ecological characteristics that potentially facilitate virus maintenance and transmission, bats likely harbor a large number of viruses, some of which may then jump to other species (Balboni et al., 2012). Hence, more effort is needed to identify and characterize the currently unrecognized CoVs that circulate in bats.",

Indeed, there was an abrupt change in the topological position of Longquan-140 and HKU3 downstream of the first breakpoint (position 1727) and upstream of the second breakpoint (position 3055). Accordingly, the Longquan-140 genome can be divided into three regions with different evolutionary histories: regions A (nucleotides 1\u20131726), B 1727\u20133055) and C (3056 to the end of the genome sequence). In regions A and C, Longquan-140 was most closely related to HKU3 with 96.0% nucleotide similarities, while in region B it occupied basal position, suggesting the recombination event originated from a currently un-sampled parental virus.

As these viruses exhibited 10% amino acid difference from members of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the conserved replicase domains (with the exception of O-MT to Sc-BatCoV 512 (9.3%; Table S2)) it is possible that Anlong-190 and Neixiang-32 represent a novel CoV species which we denote as Anlong Ms bat coronavirus. However, further studies are clearly needed to determine whether this virus indeed represents a novel coronavirus. The remaining viruses, which were discovered in bats sampled from Lushi and Neixiang and designated as Lushi Ml bat coronaviruses, formed another distinct lineage that showed a close evolutionary relationship with the bat virus JTAC2 (KU182966). Remarkably, these viruses were most closely related to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in all five gene trees (Fig. 5 and S2) and exhibited >10% difference in six conserved replicase domains from known members of the genus Alphacoronavirus in other genes (Table S3). However, the O-MT gene of Lushi Ml bat coronaviruses was most closely related to that of PEDV with 7.3% amino acid difference, indicating that it is a novel variant of PEDV (designed as Lushi Ml bat coronavirus).

More importantly, recent studies provide more evidence that human CoVs including MERS and SARS viruses may have their ultimate ancestry in bats (Annan et al., 2013, Corman et al., 2014, Corman et al., 2015, Ge et al., 2013, Huynh et al., 2012, Hu et al., 2015, Ithete et al., 2013, Tao et al., 2017). These results highlight the potential significance of detecting and characterizing of CoVs in bats before their emergence in humans. Herein we describe diverse SARSr-Rh-BatCoVs and alphacoronaviruses (including novel species) in 13 species of bats sampled from three provinces in China, with an overall prevalence of 6.84%. As such, these data reveal both the high genetic diversity and the wide geographic distribution of CoVs in diverse bats in China.",
