Current clinical applications using MSCs include treatments for bone diseases, repair of cartilage, control of graft versus host disease, facilitation of engraftment of bone marrow transplants, and treatment of myocardial infarction [6]. Researchers and clinicians alike hope that SC therapy will prove beneficial in other therapeutic fields such as treating musculoskeletal damage, cancer, and neurological disorders.",

First, despite attempts to clear bovine proteins after MSC expansion, residual bovine components may induce immune reactions in MSC recipients, in particular, immunogenic xeno-carbohydrate structures may be internalized by these cells during culture, possibly explaining MSC transplantation failure [11], [12]. Indirect evidence of such side-effects comes from rodent experimental studies where strong immunogenic reactions to \u03b22-microglobulin originating from the FBS-based culture medium were observed [13]. Similarly, inoculation of human peptide-pulsed dendritic cells grown in FBS-supplemented medium into patients with malignant melanomas resulted in the generation of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to bovine proteins and the occurrence of anaphylactic reactions [14]. Likewise, generation of antibodies to FBS components and development of arthus-like reactions were observed in 12 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infected patients, who received multiple infusions of lymphocytes from their HIV-1-uninfected identical twin siblings cultured in medium supplemented with FBS. This took place despite thorough washing of the cells before infusion [15].",

Examples of such infections originating from animal pathogens include HIV, and Ebola, Hanta, Lassa, and Nipah viruses and other paramyxoviruses, the equine morbilli virus, West Nile virus (WNV), the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [18], [19], and, more recently, the H7N9 flu virus [20] and the new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [21]. Infectious risks from bovine sources include the transmission of viruses, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus and bovine parvovirus [22], and of prions responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or mad cow disease) in cows and its human equivalent, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) [23].

The difficulty with using chemically-defined media for primary cell cultures may be associated with their inherent variability and specificity. In addition, it is anticipated that chemically defined media with a specific mix of growth factors will have to be developed to adjust to the sources of the SCs (e.g. bone marrow, adipose tissues, cord blood, dental pulp, etc.) or even possibly to the donor. As a single growth factor cannot be expected to readily provide the diverse physiological functions exhibited by such a complex protein and nutrient supplement as FBS, the limited number of licensed growth factors complying with therapeutic applications complicates the development of chemically-defined media. The use of human blood materials, possibly complemented with a mix of recombinant growth factors [31] appears to be the most pragmatic and safest approach available so far to substitute for FBS for expanding clinical-grade SCs [8], [32].",

            "text": "Initially, the use of human blood platelet-derived materials, such as human serum, as a source of essential nutrients, attachment factors and growth factors for cell growth was reported to be somewhat controversial [7]. The scientific rationale behind such use is the presence of a wide range of growth factors entrapped in platelets [33]. Platelets or thrombocytes, with a concentration range of 150,000\u2013400,000/\u03bcL, are irregularly shaped non-nucleated bodies, released into the blood by the fragmentation of megakaryocytes. In vivo, platelets play a major role in hemostasis, assisting the formation of blood clots and blood vessels and in wound healing after injury [34]. Under physiological conditions, growth factors are released by platelet activation and this release can be reproduced in vitro to prepare growth factor-rich fluids. One of the first clear demonstrations of the positive effect of growth factor-rich human blood materials on ex vivo expansion of bone marrow-derived (BM)-MSCs was, to the best of our knowledge, published in 2003 [35]. Those authors used a platelet gel releasate obtained by in vitro thrombin activation of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). They showed that BM-MSCs expanded in a medium containing up to 10% human platelet releasate retained their ability to express markers of chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation after several passages. Two years later, it was clearly demonstrated that growth medium supplemented with platelet concentrate lysate, as the sole source of nutrients, could be used to expand human BM-MSC. The lysate was made from apheresis platelet concentrates that were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C and subsequently thawed to induce platelet lysis and release their growth factors into the plasma compartment. The platelet concentrate lysate was centrifuged at 900 \u00d7 \ng to eliminate cell debris. Mean respective contents of PDGF-AB, TGF-\u03b21, basic (b)-FGF, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) were approximately 31, 51, 92 and 107 ng/mL, significantly more than those in FBS. Medium supplemented with 5% platelet lysate (PL) promoted BM-MSC expansion, decreased the time required to reach confluence, and increased the colony forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) size, compared to medium containing 10% FBS. The immunophenotype of expanded MSCs was not modified for at least four passages, and MSCs maintained their ability to differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages and exert immunosuppressive activity [36]. Since those pioneering works, many additional studies were conducted, which generally confirmed those observations. Some groups compared several types of blood materials including plasma, serum, and PLs in an attempt to identify the most suitable for a given type of MSC [37]. A recent review indicated that PLs (or activated platelet releasates) are superior or at least similar to FBS for expanding BM-MSC and adipose tissue-derived (AT)-SCs. A 5% content of platelet materials is often sufficient to replace 10% FBS, although 10% may provide optimal results for other MSCs [38].",

The BC method is favored in Europe as leucocyte depletion by BC removal reduces the frequency of febrile transfusion reactions, and facilitates a high level of leucodepletion when combined with leucocyte filtration. Therefore most whole blood-derived allogeneic platelets used for MSC expansion in Europe are likely derived from BCs.

For instance, apheresis platelet concentrates usually have significantly lower WBC contamination than standard BC-derived or PRP-derived platelet concentrates [44]. In addition, platelets undergo physiological and functional changes upon storage which may affect therapeutic benefits to the recipient. Whether such changes affect SC expansion has not been evaluated. Procedures to prepare platelet concentrates may include a leucoreduction step using different types of leucoreduction filters [45], [46]. When leucocytes are present in platelet concentrates, lysates contain higher amounts of cytokines that can influence MSC growth. In addition, until recently, platelet concentrates were suspended in 100% plasma. However, residual plasma may mitigate transfusion-related adverse reactions in recipients when used intravenously. Therefore, platelet storage additive solutions containing sodium/potassium chloride, citrate, phosphate, and mannitol may be used to substitute for part, usually 2/3, of the plasma volume [47], [48]. This affects the protein content and reduces the presence of plasma nutrients in the PLs. However, (gamma-irradiated) BCs pooled in a T-sol additive solution and subjected to freeze\u2013thaw cycles, centrifuged, and filtered could be used for expanding BM-MSCs [49]. Furthermore, plasma-poor platelet concentrates in the additive solution, subjected to pathogen reduction, were found suitable for stimulation of BM-MSC growth and maintenance of their properties [50]. Further studies are deemed necessary to confirm absence of impact of complete plasma removal on ex vivo expansion of MSCs from bone marrow or other sources. It should be noted that some research institutes utilize platelet concentrates from blood group O donors with possible dilution with blood group AB plasma [40], [51].",

A recent study has confirmed that human PLs can be produced from expired platelet concentrates and are suitable, in all aspects evaluated, as growth supplement for ex vivo expansion of BM-MSCs, as no difference between PLs from fresh and expired platelet concentrates were observed [52].",

In countries with advanced blood-collection services and mature regulatory systems, well-established safety nets are in place to prepare blood components. Safety measures include (a) epidemiological control of the population from whom blood is collected, (b) screening of donors, and (c) testing of blood donations for known viral markers. In addition, a strict traceability system should be in place, with the potential to perform back-tracing if a donor is retrospectively found to have a risk factor [54]. Each blood donation should be individually controlled using approved tests for at least HIV1/HIV2 antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and HCV antibodies. Only non-reactive donations can be used for therapeutic applications. Specific epidemiological situations may require testing for other agents or markers, such as anti-human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) I/II and WNV [54]. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) of individual donations or mini-pools of HCV, HBV, HIV, HAV, WNV (where appropriate) and/or B19V is performed in some countries to eliminate window-period donations. With modern procedures for donor screening and donation viral testing in place, the residual risk of transmission is estimated at 1 per 2.3 million donations for HIV, 1 per 1.8 million for HCV [68], [69], and approximately 1 per 300,000 donations for HBV [70]. The constant exposure of the blood supply to emerging viruses such as WNV, DENV, and CHIKV which might not be tested for yet [57], [71] could be regarded as justifying implementation of viral-inactivation treatments of blood components [55] including platelet concentrates for SC expansion.",

            "text": "In a limited number of countries, mostly in Europe, two technologies for viral inactivation of platelet concentrates for transfusion have been licensed [72]. Both target the binding and alteration of nucleic acids by a photoactivation process. One procedure (Intercept\u00ae) uses 150 \u03bcM of a synthetic psoralen (amotosalen hydrochloride or S-59) [73], [74]. This small, soluble planar molecule passes through cell membranes and capsids of viruses and reversibly intercalates into helical regions of nucleic acids. Upon illumination with ultraviolet A (UVA; at 300\u2013400 nm), covalent cross links to pyrimidines in RNA and DNA are generated, which block replication and transcription of viral nucleic acids [75]. Both random-donor and apheresis platelets suspended in plasma with or without additive solutions can be processed with this system. Residual amotosalen and free photoproducts generated during illumination are reduced by exposure to a compound-adsorption device. After treatment, the platelet concentrate is transferred to a storage container. The second procedure (Mirasol\u00ae) combines a riboflavin (vitamin B2) photosensitizer, a naturally occurring compound, and UV (265\u2013370 nm) illumination. The riboflavin planar molecule intercalates between the bases of the DNA or RNA. Upon UV illumination, riboflavin generates reactive oxygen species that oxidize guanine in nucleic acids and causes strand breakage of genomic material of viruses precluding their proliferation [76]. Riboflavin and the photo-byproducts formed (lumichrome) are generally regarded as non-toxic and therefore not eliminated [77], [78]. Most studies were performed with platelet concentrates stored in plasma [79], but more recently, treatment has been applied to BC platelet concentrates (BCPCs) [80] or apheresis platelet concentrates [81] prepared with a platelet additive solution. A third viral inactivation technology of platelet concentrates for transfusion is in development. It uses UVC illumination without the addition of a photosensitizer [82]. In vitro data indicate that viral inactivation of platelet concentrates by photoactivation methods leads to some degree of platelet activation [81]. Whether these alterations significantly influence the use of virally inactivated platelet concentrates for SC expansion is not known. Psoralen/UV-treated human serum was found to be appropriate for in vitro production of clinical-grade islets of Langerhans (for treating type I diabetes), MSCs for treating graft versus host disease (GvHD) grade III or IV and T cells (for immune therapy against malignant melanoma) [83], [84]. Recently, plasma-poor platelet in an additive solution were subjected to pathogen reduction by psoralen/UV treatment, followed by 3 cycles of freezing/thawing, and centrifugation to remove membranes, and were found to stimulate MSC growth in clinical-scale cultures [50]. In the absence of viral inactivation treatments, quarantine of PLs until donors\u2019 retesting for viral markers can be an option [49].",

However, pooling increases the need for implementation of dedicated viral-inactivation treatment(s) when PLs are used for clinical-grade SC expansion. A solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment developed for inactivating lipid-enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV, HBV, and HCV) in plasma [85] was adapted for pooled PL supplements for ex vivo SC expansion and other uses in regenerative medicine [86]. The treatment contributes to an extensive release of platelet growth factors [86]. Pooling allows the preparation of a standardized product [87] usable as a supplement for growth medium for ex vivo expansion of AT-MSCs. Proliferation rates of AT-MSCs are similar to or better than those achieved using FBS supplements; expanded MSCs preserve their typical immunophenotype for at least seven passages, and exhibit an unaltered differentiation capacity into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages [88]. S/D treatments have been used for over 20 years by the plasma product industry with excellent efficacy, safety, and robustness for inactivating lipid-enveloped viruses [59], [89]. However, S/D treatment has no impact on non-enveloped viruses, potentially requiring combination with another viral-reduction step.",

Improved donor screening, skin disinfection, and bacterial screening [93] can reduce such risks [94]. Bacterial screening can be implemented as part of the qualification of platelet units intended for use in preparing PLs for SC expansion. The two pathogen inactivation techniques of single platelet donations described before also inactivate a wide range of bacteria [75] and can therefore be useful in that regard. S/D treatment was also shown not to alter the capacity of the complement system of plasma to inactivate gram-negative bacteria and also some gram-positive bacteria [95].",

The possibility of using relatively low (\u22645%) PL concentrations can expand applications of autologous PLs. Generally, autologous PLs are prepared by activation with human thrombin or by the addition of calcium salts to counterbalance the anticoagulant added for blood collection. Thrombin and calcium ions activate platelets and convert fibrinogen into fibrin, resulting in the formation of a platelet gel and a liquid PL. Batroxobin, a venom toxin from Bothrops atrox, can also be used to convert fibrinogen to fibrin without immediate activation of platelets, a feature that is believed to delay the release of growth factors [98]. Autologous or single-donor PLs can also be prepared by a freeze\u2013thaw process (\u221280/37\u00b0C), with centrifugation at 2600 \u00d7 \ng for 30 min and storage at \u221280 \u00b0C until use [99]. Data showed that donor recipient-matched or autologous PLs are feasible for therapeutic use in cooperation with MSC products, and that plasma proteins are required for SC expansion [99]. PLs from younger donors appear to enhance MSC expansion and lead to more-pronounced osteogenic differentiation [100].",

Four BC units (blood group O) and 1 unit of plasma (blood group AB) are pooled. Such blood group selection is meant to avoid exposure of MSCs to ABO blood group antigens and isoagglutinins [51]. The units are then centrifuged at 341 \u00d7 \ng for 6 min at 22\u00b0C to obtain PRP which is transferred to a storage bag after inline filtration to deplete WBCs. To prepare the lysate, the PRP is frozen at \u221230\u00b0C. After thawing at 37\u00b0C, a minimum of 10 units of lysed human PRP (representing 40 BCs) and 10 plasma units is pooled to reduce the impact of individual donor variations. This mixture is stored at \u221230\u00b0C until use. After being thawed, the lysate is centrifuged at 4000 \u00d7 \ng for 15 min at 4\u00b0C to reduce the presence of platelet membrane fragments which may represent a risk for alloimmunization against MHC class I and human platelet antigens [51].",

Whole-blood donations of four AB-blood-group-type donors are collected to prepare BC-derived platelet concentrates by centrifugation of whole blood [102] and the concentrate is then suspended in AB plasma [40]. Several protocols to obtain PLs were compared. One method uses shock freezing twice in liquid nitrogen followed by 30 min of centrifugation at 3000 \u00d7 \ng, as also done before [36]. The supernatant is then sterile-filtered through 0.2-\u03bcm-pore filters and stored as aliquots at \u221280 \u00b0C. Alternatively, platelets are activated using either (a) human thrombin at a final concentration of 1 unit/mL, (b) 5 \u03bcM ADP/5 \u03bcM epinephrine, or (c) 1 mM thrombin receptor-activated peptide (TRAP)-6 for 45 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. In these procedures, calcium is not used for platelet activation to prevent increased osteogenic differentiation. Lysates are then centrifuged to remove the clot, sterile-filtered, and frozen. After thawing, the lysate is centrifuged at 1500 \u00d7 \ng for 5 min as new fibrin clots may form [40]. One procedure uses leucoreduced BC-derived allogeneic platelets from whole blood (450 \u00b1 45 mL) that are frozen at \u221230\u00b0C and thawed at 37\u00b0C. Such lysates obtained from 40 BCs are pooled, aliquoted, and stored at \u221230\u00b0C. Immediately before use, the aliquots are thawed and centrifuged at room temperature for 15 min at 4000 \u00d7 \ng to remove cell debris and reduce the formation of aggregates during cell culturing [101]. These lysates can be used as medium supplements to expand and support the immunomodulatory capacity of BM-MSCs [103].",

The ability of various growth factors like FGF, EFG and, in particular, VEGF to promote survival has been studied. MSCs treated with VEGF in vitro and MSCs carrying the VEGF gene in vivo increase the survival of stromal cells. Rodent hearts that had undergone myocardial infarction and had been injected with MSCs along with VEGF showed a higher number of MSCs at the injection site [134]. The surge in MSC survival was attributed to an increase in Akt signaling causing a reduction in infarct size, less fibrosis, increased vascularity, and thicker ventricular walls [135], [136]. PDGFs are potent mitogens for connective tissue cells and exert their function by interacting with related receptor tyrosine kinases, promoting cellular proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis.

When applied to MSCs in vitro to study chondrocyte regeneration, cells showed increased proliferation and a bias towards a chondrogenic lineage [137], [140]. While all three isoforms (types 1\u20133) induce proliferation of MSCs and chondrocyte formation, TGF-\u03b23 exhibits the most pronounced effect on chondrogenesis and consistently increased proliferation of MSCs [141], [142], making it a prime factor for inducing chondrogenesis from implanted MSCs. Similarly, bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2 to -7 growth factors, which belong to the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily, are known to affect bone formation. While BMP-2, -4, -6, and -7 induce MSCs to form osteoblasts, BMP-2 has the greatest impact on differentiation [143]. MSCs overexpressing BMP-2 and implanted with the ECM protein, collagen I, as in a hydrogel system, increased proliferation of MSC differentiation into bone; this model was used to study cranial closure in swine [144], [145]. Another member of the same family, BMP-3, increased MSC proliferation 3-fold [146]. Since all these factors affect bone formation at different rates and some have a greater effect on proliferation, synergistic pairs of these growth factors can be used at optimal doses and at specific points during the bone-regeneration process. One such search for synergistic pairs led to combination treatment of MSCs with TGF\u03b23 and BMP-2, and chondrogenic differentiation was found to be enhanced [146], [147].",

TGF-\u03b2 and members of this growth factor family can also signal via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Rho GTPase and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathways in MSCs [149]. The effect of BMP-2 on proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was shown to occur via sustained signaling of the MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) [150]. The mitogenic effects of BMP-3, on the other hand, were found to be mediated by TGF-\u03b2/activin signaling and not by any of the MAPK signaling pathways, with ALK-4, SMAD 2, and SMAD 3 being key players involved in MSC proliferation and differentiation [146].",

            "text": "MSCs pretreated with TGF-\u03b1 exhibited increased survival. This improvement was also attributed to VEGF signaling, although direct signaling through the EGF receptor (EGFR) cannot be discounted. TGF-\u03b1 increases VEGF production via the p38 MAPK pathway and enhances recovery [151]. Therefore, in ischemic cardiac tissues, MSCs supplanted with VEGF have so far been the best choice for increased survival, leading to improved vascularity in ischemic cardiac tissues and isolated islets. Several other platelet growth factors were proven to increase MSC survival. MSC transplantation with BDNF and nerve growth factor (NGF) into rodents after traumatic brain injury produced significantly higher numbers of engrafted cells compared to MSCs transplanted with no growth factor [152]. PDGF-BB was found to reduce the loss of cells by apoptosis by 46% as seen between days 5 and week 3 in rats following an acute myocardial infarction [153]. Contrary to its limited effect on MSC expansion, HGF caused a slight increase in MSC survival. PI3K signaling was implicated in this increase [154]. Another major growth factor studied for its effects on MSC survival is EGF. Since initial studies showed that EGF in a soluble state does not cause differentiation of MSCs but enhances expansion, it was hypothesized that soluble EGF would similarly enhance survival of MSCs subjected to pro-death cytokines such as FasL and TRAIL in vitro. Contrary to what was expected, soluble EGF did not protect MSCs, but increased cell death in the presence of FasL [155].",

The PDGF and TGF-\u03b2 families of cytokines that affect cell morphogenesis, proliferation, and differentiation were found to be abundant in PLs with the potential to influence MSC culture. The selection of specific growth factors derived from PLs can be used to expand MSCs or differentiate MSCs towards a specific lineage. PDGF-AB/BB, TGF-\u03b21 and bFGF are essential stimuli for the proliferation of MSCs. The three factors bFGF, PDGF-BB and TGF-\u03b21 seem to be necessary for optimal proliferation of MSC; however, these three factors are insufficient on their own, even when using cell culture multiwell plates coated with human fibronectin and human placental collagen I\u2013III. Therefore, in addition to the essential components, PDGF-BB, TGF-\u03b21, bFGF, and other constituents of PLs are important for their full biologic activity [49].",

Although not all blood donations are currently used to prepare platelet concentrates, these figures provide some idea of the volume of platelet concentrates potentially available for use for SC expansion based on a mean volume of 30 mL of platelet concentrate per donation. It is also now established that PLs produced from expired platelet concentrates are suitable as supplements for SC expansion [157].",

Allogeneic materials present the advantage of being available worldwide as a side-product of the preparation of RBC concentrates that are by far the major driver of whole-blood collection in the world. In addition, apheresis procedures can be implemented for the dedicated collection of platelet concentrates if there is a need. Principles of GMP (donor screening, viral testing, traceability, production monitoring, etc.) that are in place for collecting blood components used for traditional transfusion or further manufacture [158] needs constitute a professional framework that can definitely support the quality and safety requirements of allogeneic platelet concentrates as source materials for preparing growth factor-rich PLs for therapeutic-scale SC expansion and regenerative medicine. In addition, the possibility of performing autologous platelet collection represents an alternative source of PLs when a small expansion culture volume is acceptable to reach clinically meaningful MSC numbers. One can expect that further improvements in the ex vivo expansion of MSCs and their clinical applications will allow the development of fully autologous treatment procedures. We believe that human PLs made from well-controlled platelet concentrate sources and production procedures have the potential to become the next clinical-grade gold standard as supplements for the isolation and ex vivo expansion of SCs.",
