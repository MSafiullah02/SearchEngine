            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to Flaviviridae family. There are four DENV serotypes that are antigenically different, namely DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4. Its RNA genome encodes a single polypeptide which is subsequently processed by virus and host proteases to form three structural and seven non-structural proteins in the order C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 [1], [2]. The capsid protein undergoes oligomerization and interacts with viral RNA to form nucleocapsid. The pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins synthesized at endoplasmic reticulum form heterodimers and further interact with virus nucleocapsid to generate immature virus particles. The immature virus particles are transported through trans-Golgi network and cleaved by host protease furin to form infectious mature virus particles. Mature virions are subsequently released from the host cell by exocytosis [3], [4].",

NS2A is involved in generation of virus-induced membranes during virus assembly [10]. NS2B acts as the co-factor for the protease activity of NS3 protein [11], [12]. NS3 functions as a serine protease/RNA helicase [13]. NS4A induces membrane rearrangements to form viral replication complex and acts as an interferon antagonist [14], [15]. NS4B inhibits type I interferon response of host cells and modulates viral replication through its association with NS3 [15], [16]. NS5 protein possesses methyl transferase activity and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity [13]. However, the exact molecular mechanism underlying the functions of these viral proteins remains to be deciphered in great detail.",

Approximately 2.5 billion people living in tropical and subtropical countries are at risk of epidemic transmission and 50\u2013100 million-dengue infections occur annually. About 500,000 dengue-infected individuals develop the life threatening Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome [19], [20]. There is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapies available against DENV infections. The only form of treatment available today is the supportive treatment and prevention is through vector control and boosting the immunity. Hence there is a great urge for the development of vaccines or novel antivirals. Viruses are known to subvert host proteins to create a more favorable environment for their replication. It is thus important to understand the virus-host protein interactions that mediate different steps of DENV life cycle to develop good antiviral drugs.",

PTB has been shown to regulate RNA transcription, translation and virus propagation of several viruses including picornavirus, coronavirus and herpes virus [28], [29], [30]. The involvement of PTB in regulating viral replication and translation was also shown in Hepatitis C virus [31], [32], [33], [34].

RNA viruses are known to replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells although Uchil and colleagues [37] reported that DENV replication occured within the nucleus. Moreover, several structural and non-structural proteins of flavivirus were shown to enter the nucleus and this nuclear phase is critical for their replication. Though PTB is present predominantly in the nucleus at static state, a significant cytoplasmic localization was also reported and it can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm [38], [39]. Thus the cellular distribution of PTB together with its interaction with a component of DENV replicative complex indicated that PTB can influence DENV production.",

This study identified that PTB binding to DENV RNA genome is crucial and reduced binding affected negative strand RNA synthesis which accounted for the altered DENV production in PTBKD cells (Fig. 4). This is in consistent with Mouse Hepatitis virus where PTB influenced transcription, but not translation of viral RNA [40]. Recently, Davis and colleagues [18] showed that binding of elongation factor 1 alpha to West Nile virus RNA genome is critical for viral negative strand RNA synthesis. This suggested that PTB might play a similar role in DENV replication or PTB might function together with elongation factor 1 alpha to facilitate DENV negative strand RNA synthesis.",
