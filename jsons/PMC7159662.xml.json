Sialic acids share a characteristic nine\u2010carbon backbone, with carboxylic acid residues attached to the C2 carbon atom, and they occupy the distal end of glycan chains, a location that makes them suitable for interactions with other cells and with environmental agents. The negative charge on the Sia unit has many modulatory roles. In mucins, sialoglycan increases the viscosity of the proteins and protects epithelial cells from bacterial infection.1 Whereas in cancer cells, sialoglycans are overexpressed to safeguard malignant cells from the immunoevasion of natural killer (NK) cells.2 In addition to their function of physically masking cellular biomolecules, Sias participate in major biological events through specific carbohydrate\u2013protein interactions (CPIs). There are more than 50 different types of naturally occurring Sias, which differ in the type of substituents on the hydroxy and amine groups.3\nN\u2010Glycolyl, N\u2010hydroxy, N\u2010acetimidoyl, N\u2010acetyl, and N\u2010lactyl substituents are found on the 5\u2010amino group of Sia, whilst O\u2010acetyl, O\u2010lactyl, O\u2010phosphate, and O\u2010sulfate are examples of substituents that are found on the hydroxy groups. Furthermore, Sias are also linked to penultimate carbohydrate residues, either through \u03b1(2\u20136), \u03b1(2\u20133), \u03b1(2\u20138) or by \u03b1(2\u20139) glycosidic linkages.4 The structural diversity and variety of glycosidic linkages articulate a wide range of cellular events through specific CPIs.",

These proteins utilize specific sialoglycan structures on cell surfaces to regulate pathogenicity and a multitude of physiological events. For example, human H3N2 influenza viruses utilize the Sia \u03b1(2\u20136) linkage to induce virulence, whereas avian H5N1 viruses recognize the Sia \u03b1(2\u20133) linkage on cell surfaces.5 Furthermore, Influenza C and coronaviruses preferential bind to N\u2010glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and 9\u2010O\u2010acetylated Sia to infect mammalian cells,6, 7 whilst the simian virus (SV40) recognizes GM1 ganglioside (GM=ganglioside monosialic) as a preferred ligand.8 A large number of bacteria, such as E. coli, Streptococcus, Helicobacter, and parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum, attack vertebrate cells through Sia\u2010mediated interactions. B. streptococcus displayed a specific Sia \u03b1(2\u20133)Gal linkage, which binds to a Sia\u2010binding protein on neutrophils, weakens the immune responses, and invades the human immune system.9 Toxins from Vibrio and Clostridium species also bind to sialogangliosides.10, 11 Surprisingly, the AB5 toxin secreted by Shiga toxigenic E. coli binds to Neu5Gc glycans and induces gastrointestinal disease in humans.12\n",

Siglecs belong to a major subfamily of type\u2010I lectins, which are widely expressed on immune cells and provide an array of diverse functions based on specific sialoglycan\u2010mediated interactions.13 Among the family of Siglecs, Siglec\u20102 and Siglec\u20107 are attractive targets for cancer therapy.14, 15 Siglec\u20102 (CD22) is overexpressed on B\u2010cell lymphomas and leukemia; as such, human anti\u2010CD22 has been used to treat B\u2010cell non\u2010Hodgkin\u2032s lymphoma.15 Siglec\u20107 is expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes cells and it selectively recognizes \u03b1(2\u20138) di\u2010Sia ligands.16 It has been shown that up\u2010regulating cell\u2010surface Sia on cancer cells helps them to escape Siglec\u20107\u2010dependent attacks of NK cells; therefore, compounds that exhibit an inhibitory effect towards Siglec\u20107 can activate NK cells and be used for cancer therapy.17 Another set of Sia\u2010binding lectins are found on endothelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets, which are classified as E\u2010selectins, L\u2010selectins, and P\u2010selectins, respectively.18 P\u2010selectin is present on activated platelets and endothelial cells, whereas E\u2010selectin is exposed on the endothelium after activation by cytokines, and leukocytes express L\u2010selectin. Targeting P\u2010 and E\u2010selectins can be used to monitor endothelial cells in the early phases of inflammation. Binding to L\u2010selectin enables the visualization of local concentrations of leukocytes or can even modulate their function.19 These lectins bind explicitly to sialyl Lewisx (SLx) and sialyl Lewisa (SLa) glycans, respectively. Interestingly, tumor cells also express the SLx residue, which binds to selectins. Such selectins have a role in tumor\u2010cell migration and metastasis.20 Finally, the discovery that \u03b2\u2010amyloid binds to Sia has had a significant impact on the field of Alzheimer\u2032s disease targeting.21\n",

However, investigating biological processes by using Sia monosaccharide in the solution phase is a huge challenge, owing to its very weak binding interactions with lectins/proteins, which are within the range mm\u2013\u03bcm.22 To overcome this difficulty, multivalent systems have been developed in which clusters that contain many Sia molecules with different topologies have been developed, thus amplifying the effect of the CPIs.23 Several reviews have been published on the use of multivalent probes in targeting a wide range of carbohydrate ligands.24, 25, 26, 27, 28 This Minireview primarily focuses on multivalent Sia probes to investigate CPIs and biological potency. We will mainly highlight the detailed synthesis of four important multivalent scaffolds, that is, sialo\u2010polymers, sialo\u2010dendrimers, sialo\u2010nanoparticles, and sialo\u2010liposomes, which have been used to decipher specific CPIs (Figure 1). We shall also describe the potential applications of multivalent Sia probes in drug delivery, imaging, and biosensors.\n",

The use of a polymeric network is one of the earliest known examples of multivalent Sia probes.29 The main synthetic approaches that have been developed to obtain glycopolymers are: 1) the assembly of monomeric sialoside ligands by using an acrylate free\u2010radical polymerization method (convergent strategy); and 2) the coupling of sialoside ligands on commercially available well\u2010defined polymer scaffolds (divergent strategy). In 1995, Whiteside\u2032s group reported a convergent free\u2010radical\u2010based polymerization method to synthesize acrylamide\u2010based Sia copolymers.30 They tested various adjuvants, such as ionic, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, and bulky substituents, with Sia ligands to modulate influenza\u2010virus\u2010mediated hemagglutinin activity and found that the presence of hydrophobic and charged species in the sialo\u2010polymers enhanced the virus\u2013protein binding affinity. Furthermore, the number of pendant Sia residues on the polymer backbone had a direct influence on the agglutination and illustrated the importance of multivalency in interfering with the viral binding to cell surfaces.",

However, such functionalization of higher oligosaccharides is laborious and requires multistep syntheses. To get around this problem, Kimura and co\u2010workers combined the copper(I)\u2010mediated click reaction with an acrylate\u2010polymerization strategy and synthesized sialo\u2010oligosaccharide copolymers (Figure 2 a).31 These sialo\u2010polymers (Neu5Ac\u03b1(2\u20133)gal\u03b2(1\u20134)gal, sialylated N\u2010glycan) were functionalized on a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to study their binding affinity with influenza viruses. The sialylated N\u2010glycan polymer was found to exhibit stronger binding with human and avian influenza A viruses compared to the Neu5Ac\u2010polymer, which was attributed to multivalency and synergistic effects of the higher\u2010oligosaccharide to afford sensitive virus\u2013protein recognition.\n",

To overcome these drawbacks, the Kiessling group employed ring\u2010opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) to synthesize sialo\u2010copolymers.32 They constructed a copolymer that was composed of a B\u2010cell receptor (BCR)\u2010binding epitope and the Siglec\u20102 (CD22) specific ligand to investigate the trans interactions between Siglec\u20102 and Sia glycans, which were regulated by the activation of BCR. They prepared the copolymers by using BCR and CD22 antigens, such as 2,4\u2010dinitrophenylnorbornene and Sia \u03b1(2\u20136) LacNAc\u2212norbornene monomers (LacNAc=N\u2010acetyl\u2010d\u2010lactosamine), in the presence of a ruthenium\u2212carbene initiator. These copolymers enabled the simultaneous targeting of BCR and CD22 (Siglec\u20102) receptors, induced trans interactions in the CD22 signaling, and activated several pathways (Figure 2 b). Working under the same notion, Olsen and co\u2010workers synthesized a brush\u2010like sialo\u2010polymer by using a ROMP synthetic strategy.33 Based on the structural similarities between the native mucins and synthetic sialo\u2010polymers, it was possible to use them as model systems to analyze antiviral activities. Furthermore, their results also suggested that the brush topology also contributed to the viscosity of the polymer and the process of infection suppression.",

            "text": "Notably, free\u2010radical and ROMP methods for direct polymerization were found to be efficient techniques for nonfunctional carbohydrate ligands. However, most cell\u2010surface glycans are negatively charged sialoside ligands and it has been shown that functional groups, such as sulfate or acid groups, lower the efficiency of free\u2010radical polymerization. Hence, an effective method for the synthesis of structurally well\u2010defined glycopolymers is still required. Recently, Tanaka and co\u2010workers reported the \u03c0\u2010allyl\u2212nickel\u2010catalyzed coordination polymerization of allene monomers as an alternative method for the synthesis of sialo\u2010polymers that generated an excellent dispersity index.34 By using this technique, they prepared sialo\u2010polymers that could target Siglec\u20107 on NK\u2010cells (Figure 2 c). Overall, in a convergent strategy, several challenges must be met to synthesize defined sialo\u2010polymers. Alternatively, the functionalization of sialoside ligands on polymer scaffolds, commonly termed a \u201cdivergent strategy\u201d, typically allows the large\u2010scale synthesis of glycopolymers. Savasta and co\u2010workers explored a divergent strategy for the synthesis of GM3\u2010ganglioside\u2010based polymers to alter cell\u2010signaling, thereby modulating cell\u2010proliferation.35 The galactose/lactose ceramide ligands were coupled with an acrylic acid polymer scaffold in different stoichiometric ratios to generate lactose\u2013ceramide polymers. These polymers were enzymatically reacted with a Sia precursor to synthesize GM3 polymers. The cell\u2010proliferation assay and cell\u2010signaling assay in the presence of these polymers revealed that the number of GM3 units per polymer and hydrophobic residue of GM3 directly influenced the inhibition of cell proliferation.",

Both sialo\u2010dendrimers showed similar binding affinities with A\u03b2\u2010protein, but the thiourea\u2010based sialo\u2010PAMAM displayed stronger inhibition of A\u03b2\u2010mediated neurotoxicity. These results clearly illustrated the significance of having native Sia ligands on the PAMAM to control its biological activities.

            "text": "Nanoparticles are well\u2010organized, robust dendrimers that exhibit large surface areas and have inherent optical, electrochemical, and magnetic properties that facilitate the sensing and imaging of specific interactions. Several types of sialo\u2010nanoparticles have been reported in the literature, the most prevalent of which are gold, silver, silica, iron, cadmium, selenium, and virus\u2010like nanoparticles. Owing to their unique physical properties, these nanoparticles are attractive biomaterials for Sia research. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been widely used in sialo\u2010nanotechnology, because of their large surface area, electronic conductivity, nontoxicity, facile synthesis, and functionalizability, which characterize the sialo\u2010conjugates.63 AuNPs were synthesized by reducing gold(III) chloride in the presence of a suitable surfactant and sodium borohydride. Finally, these nanoparticles were functionalized by using suitable sialoside ligands. Sialo\u2010AuNPs can be formed by: 1) direct ligand exchange between sialo\u2010functionalized thiol linkers and AuNPs; or 2) coupling reactions between Sia derivatives and functionalized AuNPs. Process (1) offers several advantages, including control over the number of sialoside ligands per nanoparticle and the resultant sialo\u2010AuNPs do not contain additional functional groups, which may induce nonspecific interactions during CPIs. Ijiro and co\u2010workers synthesized sialo\u2010AuNPs by using directed ligand exchange between sialylated oligosaccharides that contained a thiol linker and AuNPs (5, 10, and 15 nm).64 These nanoparticles were used to detect the John Cunningham (JC) virus, which displayed 360 copies of Sia\u2010binding virus protein 1 (VP1). The specific carbohydrate\u2013protein interactions between VP1 and sialo\u2010AuNPs resulted in clustering of the AuNPs on the surface of the viruses, and led to a significant plasmonic shift in UV/Vis absorption spectrum of the AuNPs, which ultimately allowed the sensitive detection of the virus system. Similarly, Fairbanks and co\u2010workers reported the synthesis of bi\u2010sialo bi\u2010antennary N\u2010glycan\u2010AuNPs to detect the influenza virus at nanomolar concentrations (Figure 8 a).65 First, they isolated N\u2010glycan from egg yolk and conjugated it to NHS\u2010(S)\u2010acetylthioacetic acid active ester (NHS=N\u2010hydroxysuccinimide). Mild deacetylation of the glycan afforded a good amount of the N\u2010glycan with the thiol linker for direct conjugation onto the AuNPs. The resultant sialo\u2010AuNPs were subjected to colorimetric detection of the influenza virus and the results from these studies confirmed the development of an inexpensive, sensitive platform for the detection of the influenza virus. A similar goal has also driven Haag and co\u2010workers to synthesize Sia\u2010conjugated AuNPs (2 and 14 nm) for a sialo\u2010ligand\u2010dependent hemaglutination assay with the influenza virus (Figure 8 b).66 In yet another development, Russell and co\u2010workers synthesized sialo\u2010AuNPs by using direct ligand exchange to detect mSiglec\u2010E which expressed on CHO cell lines by using a colorimetric method (Figure 8 c).67 Overall, direct ligand exchange afforded quick access to the sialo\u2010AuNPs, which was an efficient platform for the detection of the influenza virus. However, the major limitation of this strategy was the requirement for a large quantity of sialoside ligands. In such a scenario, process (2) is ideal. However, the critical requirement of process (2) is to identify mild, efficient coupling reactions that result in neutral epitopes. Tamiya and co\u2010workers employed a click chemistry reaction between a sialoside azide linker and acetylene\u2010functionalized AuNPs to synthesize sialo\u2010AuNPs, which were coated onto a carbon electrode to fabricate an electrochemical A\u03b2\u2010peptides biosensor.68 Similarly, Russell and co\u2010workers synthesized sialo\u2010AuNPs by using click chemistry to develop a biosensor for the detection of the influenza A virus (Figure 8 d).69 Nishimura and co\u2010workers employed an oxide\u2010coupling reaction between aminooxy\u2010functionalized AuNPs and a sialoside ketone linker to synthesize sialo\u2010AuNPs, which were used to detect the influenza A virus.70\n",

Chen and co\u2010workers prepared sialo\u2010selenium nanoparticles and utilized the anticancer activity of selenium to enhance the uptake and apoptosis of cancer cells.83 In an another development, Liu and co\u2010workers synthesized sialo\u2010selenium nanoparticles that contained B6 peptides to cross the blood/brain barrier and target amyloid\u2010\u03b2\u2010peptide aggregation in Alzheimer\u2032s disease models.84\n",

            "text": "Over the past few decades, our knowledge of the functions of sialic acid has improved substantially, thanks to multivalent sialosides. Many multivalent tools, such as polymers, dendrimers, liposomes, and nanoparticles, have been functionalized with sialoglycans, either through convergent or divergent strategies and these probes have provided an in\u2010depth knowledge of the Sia\u2010mediated influenza virus, Siglecs, selectin, and \u03b2\u2010amyloid interactions. However, despite the remarkable advances that have been made in their synthesis, there are still tremendous challenges in expanding the use of multivalent systems in clinical research, primarily owing to their toxicity and synthetic challenges. Thus, it is imperative to establish more\u2010efficient strategies for their synthesis. Suitable chemical and chemoenzymatic synthetic strategies are expected to procure sialoglycans on the gram scale to understand biological recognition and have a positive influence on clinical studies. Moreover, the solubility problems and aggregation of sialo\u2010nanoparticles does not allow in vivo applications. Therefore, we need appropriate linker systems between the Sia ligand and the nanoparticles to enhance solubility and improve the selective targeting. With the sialo multivalent probes, there are still no defined rules for the design of universal multivalent probes that can meet the needs of a wide range of biological problems. Each time, we need to synthesize a library of multivalent probes to establish the efficacy of multivalency, ligand composition, and concentration for a specific biological function. To alleviate this problem, we need a standard sialo multivalent probe to compare the relative activities.",
