Thus, the use of existing and already rolled-out technology is essential and almost the only way (a) to crowd-source information concerning the health of individuals and (b) to ensure that social distancing rules are being respected. These two requirements stem from the perspective of a general epidemic analysis and urgently need to be combined with technical support such that (i) the individuals privacy, (ii) the personal freedom of an inhabitant of Switzerland and many other countries -in contrast to a selected list of differently organized countries of the world -, and (iii) the avoidance of \"finger-pointing\" to select humans can be reached technically and efficiently in the shortest possible time frame.",

This means that the underlying assumption of this work is -as very many others do that, too, but do not necessarily state that explicitly: \"one mobile device belongs to one individual and is used by this individual only during the pandemic\". Furthermore, the application of low-range BTE communications determines a highly suitable coincidence between the COVID-19 \"social distancing\" requirements and the communications technology: Since only those individuals in a range of a few meters (if staying that close together for approximately 10 to 15 minutes) potentially are subject to contagious infection, their mobile devices can, if the WeTrace application is enabled and configured, exchange health data in a fully privacy-protecting manner, such that the infection status information can be exchanged fully anonymous and in a secured (encrypted) manner.",

This paper is organized as follows. While Section II summarizes major related work and compares those against the key dimensions of utmost importance set for a privacy-preserving tracing application, Section III determines the essential requirements needed to meet the goal of hiding in full the privacy of an individual participating. Derived from those requirements the WeTrace approach is introduced in Section IV and relevant technical details are provided. Section V follows with major specificities of its technical implementation. While Section VI discusses first trade-offs taken as well as observations obtained and analysis performed with respect to proximity, privacy, and user overhead, it complements second with evaluations on the communication channel used, attacks mitigated, storage sizes, and scalability. Thus finally, Section VII summarizes and concludes the WeTrace work as one essential step into a fully privacy-preserving tracking and tracing application world.",

Of course, systems for tracking and tracing exist and various mobile devices show a variety of very different, but related functionality, including the search option for a displaced smartphone, once it had been misplaced or stolen. However, very many if not all such approaches known do trade-off the individual's privacy or the human's data privacy in one way or another. Thus, the notification or alerting option of today's tracking and tracing systems has not reached an acceptable standard with respect to user privacy and user data privacy.",

Additionally, this includes for sure nonnegotiable guarantees that these systems cannot be used as (a) attacking tools to the availability of other systems, (b) jeopardizing the privacy of users themselves, (c) violating the privacy of user data, and (d) revealing at any step performed private and to be secured personal (health) data. In this sense, Table I collects the major characteristics of related systems in order to clarify the state-of-the-art concerning tools and proposals related to COVID-19-driven tracing and tracking. An extensive report of further related work collections performed by several contributors can be found at [1] . A global report on approaches by governmental and private projects to use personal data to combat COVID-19 can be found at [2] .

This is essential for a verification of the privacy-preserving property of the approach as well as other security metrics 3) Reporting: Concerning whether users applying this approach within their smartphone are able to flag themselves being in one certain medical state, e.g., \"not infected\", \"close contact with infected\", \"infected\", \"infected, being with symptoms\", \"indifferent\", or \"healthy\". There is no \"cured\" state, as this state is considered as \"not infected\". However, since the actual states are not important for the WeTrace application's operation (any sort of data can be integrated into a message, unless it grows to large for the Backend to publish), the actual medical states needed have to be discussed and defined with epidemiologists. 4) Data Collected: Determining the type of data being collected and processed, generally that is possible from the user and/or a Backend (cf. below), if involved. These data may include Global Positioning System (GPS) data for geo-localization, timing-related information, medical status (cf. before), communication addresses, or phone numbers. 5) Privacy-preserving Mechanism: As it is mandatory that any solution/tool does not violate the users privacy, e.g., by revealing their identity, health conditions, or geographical localization. A security and risk analysis of this or these mechanism(s) foreseen or deployed does determine the level of privacy to be reached. 6) Communication Technology: The technical communication solution selected enables the collection of relevant (or irrelevant) information on the users encounters. Mainly the focus here is on BLE and GPS. Approaches using of the Wi-Fi communication technology or any 3G to 5G communication approach is not listed here, since all of them do limit by definition the users privacy due to the use of IP (Internet Protocol) addresses or phone numbers, since Internet Service Providers are required by law in selected countries to keep track of the \"owner\" of an IP address for a certain time and the use of SIM cards legally requires a registration of users with their full identity, respectively. 7) User Notification: The key feedback channel back to the user needs to be identified, especially for any type of feedback the user may want to know about the data collected, e.g., graphs, statistics, summaries, or simple \"encounter\" information. Depending on the system and data, such data may be already privacy-protected, thus, encrypted. 8) Storage: The storage of Data Collected is partially important for comparisons, statistics, and trends. Thus, different approaches are deployed to store data in general or messages specifically in form of: e.g., local storage, in the cloud, on private servers, or on individual devices only. Also, based on the storage approach, Backends (cf. next) might be required to receive and actively forward information related to the medical status. 9) Backend: The Backend is important for (a) an exchange of data between devices, which are geographically not close (any more due to mobile users), (b) a possible \"comparison\" of data broadcast to the Backend, (c) a pure relaying of messages, or (d) a publication of static content. Depending on the specific role intended, one can derive how much power and information the provider of such a Backend holds. Example instances of these (not necessarily orthogonal) roles include servers with e.g., a central database of all medical states, a relay functionality for messages, a broadcasting function for messages, or a publishing activity of static content.",

As discussed above in Section II, the actual states are to be discussed with epidemiologists. \u2022 Medical Doctor: Currently, the WeTrace application relies on self-reporting to detect COVID-19 infections, which might lead to the spam of false-positives. To address such a problem, a medical doctor does act as a testing person. However, this could potentially weaken the privacy of the approach, if doctor-user relations may become public. \u2022 Governmental Health Agency: Similarly to medical doctors, governmental health agencies could provide trusted data concerning the medical status of an individual. However, research on how to maintain privacy concerning eHealth data must be conducted, as pointed out by [23] , [24] . Thus, the WeTrace application focuses at this stage of the implementation on those three medical states as determined above only. \u2022 Devices determine the technical platform on which GPS and BLE-enabled communications happen and where WeTrace is installed on. A Device stores the following information: Master seed used to generate public-private key pairs, public keys of devices (which have WeTrace installed) encountered within 2 m of proximity and being in contact for longer than an epidemiological relevant time (e.g., 10 to 15 min), a timestamp, and the approximated geo-location of encounters. \u2022 A Backend broadcasts all messages of users who changed their status from \"not infected\" to \"infected\". The Backend does not store any data, only publishes them to other WeTrace-enabled devices, which perform the decryption of messages in case of needs. \u2022 The Server Administrator of the Backend must be taken into consideration as he/she will have access to all messages originating from WeTrace applications. Although all messages are encrypted with private keys and the server does not store any public keys, the server administrator has full access of these messages and related information, e.g., IP addresses and the device platform that could be used to infer the identity of a user. \u2022 Identity Provider: Even though the identity of the user is only known within the device (based on the storage of private keys generated via the master seed), such devices require outside the use of the WeTrace application the registration with Communication Service Providers, e.g., telephony operators, 4G cells and their Base Stations, or Internet Service Providers (ISP) with their Wi-Fi networks.

Besides these pubic keys P K * , both devices also store a timestamp and the approximate geolocation of where this encounter had happened. Generally, this contact information is collected for all other devices in close proximity, too. 4) Upon User A's information received, e.g., from a doctor or a hospital with which the owner of the device had medical interrogations with, User A wants to report an \"infection\" or a \"non-infected\" status. Thus, the Device A will go through the list of close contacts collected as within step 3 and encrypts one message each for every public key of close contacts. In case of User A, it will be encrypted once with P K B , because this was the only contact. All those messages will be sent to the Backend via a different than BLE communication channel. The Backend will relay these messages to all devices. The messages will contain the data that User A chose to share, so either only the fact that an infection happened or not, or additionally when or even where it happened. As noted above, it is important that only the reporting user decides if he/she wants to share this additional information. 5) Device B and Device C now receive from the Backend a notification telling them that new reports have been seen. Thus, Device B will then try to decrypt every message already recorded at the step 3, the close encounter, with SK B and will eventually find out that a message was directed at him/her, thus, indicating to User B the status User A now knows and reported. Device C will do perform exactly the same steps, however, because no message in his/her local storage was encrypted with P K C , no message can be decrypted, thus, no information is relayed to User C. While this example indicates clearly how the use of publicprivate cryptography mechanisms ensures the generation of an unrecorded -thus, no individual identity being assigned to a public-private key pair -identity, which is temporary for the life-time of the application. A new installation will generate a new public-private key pair.
