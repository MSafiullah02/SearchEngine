This explains our choice of terminology: policy innovations for health. We start from a perspective that considers both health and innovation to be central driving forces in 21st century societies, and we maintain that their prominent role reflects major societal shifts that are under way. The consequence is not only a changing role of health in modern societies but also a new perception of innovation in relation to health.",

The shift from the industrial society of the 19th and 20th centuries to the knowledge societies of the 21st century is as ground-breaking as was the shift from the agrarian to the industrial world \u2013 and they are similar in their deep impact on health, this increases the need for innovation. The changes in our way of life are shaping our lifestyles and have created a situation where many of the patterns of everyday life \u2013 for example, our eating and food shopping patterns \u2013 and new forms of social stratification \u2013 for example, new forms of social inclusion and exclusion \u2013 endanger our health. This means that we need to understand that the health challenges and the diseases that come with this change are of a larger societal, not an individual nature.",

The authors of this book are focused on the second challenge and the policy mechanisms that are needed to address it. The need for change is vast. First, there is hardly a policy sector that can be excluded: health, education, agriculture, transport, industry, consumer affairs, and sports \u2013 all are essential to support health. Second, in a consumer society the role of business is critical and consumers themselves must express their demand. Finally, communities must act for their health interest and individuals are required to support their individual health and that of their families in new ways. To do so they need to be able to negotiate and navigate an increasingly complex health and care environment.",

            "text": "A recent analysis concerned with innovation and high performing health systems [2] underlines that there are two goals of innovation in relation to health: improving the affordability, quality, and efficiency of the health care system and improving the health of populations. Ideally the two would be fully complementary \u2013 in the real world they are not. Usually when we speak of innovation in the context of health the automatic assumption is that we mean the expansion of therapeutic possibilities \u2013 we associate new medicines, new technologies, and increasingly the potential of biomedicine and genetics. Sometimes we think of new approaches to the organization and financing of the medical care system, then we typically speak of \u201chealth care reform\u201d \u2013 a term that is now linked almost exclusively with efficiency, effectiveness, and cost saving. The words innovation and health policy do not by and large sit very well together because the notion of \u201cnewness\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d that is at the core of innovation has been overshadowed by many short-term reorganizations of health care systems that seem to lack in vision and long-term perspective. And, if innovation is considered in terms of radical innovation only then we experience a clear tension between the drive for innovation and the constant challenge to keep down health care expenditures. A recent Health Innovation Survey by the OECD [3] typically focuses on the \u201cquestion how to encourage and foster innovation which addresses health needs and priorities, maximizes access to benefits, and manages challenges and risks in a way that is beneficial to both innovators and health systems.\u201d Innovation in this case is also mainly related to innovations in biotechnology and the key challenge is how OECD countries are able to cope with introducing such technical and product-based innovations into their respective health care systems. This focus on financial pressure has led \u2013 through a range of new assessment mechanisms \u2013 to a reinforcement of a binary understanding of innovation as being either radical or incremental and a focus on medical rather than social value.",

I argue that we now live in a health society which is characterized by two major social processes: the expansion of the territory of health and the expansion of the reflectivity of health [4]. The creation of the health society of the 21st century has been a process long in the making, beginning from about the mid 17th century onward. Health is integral to modernity and our modern societies would not be possible without the health gains achieved in this 250-year period [5]. During this time the balance of power between the four domains of the health system \u2013 personal health, public health, medical health, and the health market \u2013 has shifted continuously. The domains of personal health and public health dominated the 18th and 19th centuries, while during the 20th century the medical health domain gained increasing strength both in terms of its power over the social definition of health and the dominance of its organizational and governance infrastructure; this process of dominance has been referred to as medicalization. As a consequence, in both political and public perceptions, the social organization of health resides in what we have come to call the health care system and concerns over how to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of this system dominate the health policy debate.",

In this health is similar to innovation, which is also increasingly defined as being fluid, an issue that will be reflected upon later in this chapter. Indeed the expansion and liquidity of boundaries is a major characteristic of what the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman calls \u201cliquid modernity\u201d [6]. This changes the health policy debate because it means that health is everywhere: every policy decision a government makes also impacts on health and at the individual level every behavioral choice also has a health consequence. This was always the case \u2013 but now it is part of reflective modernity. Most discussions on health policy do not yet take this deep seminal change into account \u2013 they still focus on tinkering with a well-defined functional system of health governance, where through a process of defining the evidence base, they aim to ensure clear boundaries, define interventions, and prioritize medical rather than social solutions. The authors of this book are of the opinion that we clearly need a policy approach that responds more adequately to the new environment of 21st century health.",

This is due to the fact that health itself has become a major economic and social driving force in society [7] and that good health outcomes are increasingly important for a range of societal goals. The Conference Board of Canada [2] suggests understanding innovation \u201cas a means by which societies, systems or organizations achieve social or economic value (e.g. increasing positive health outcomes)\u201d; they maintain that innovation occurs only when new value is created. Our focus in this book is to explore what kind of policy innovations for health are required to achieve better population health, in terms of both its social and economic value. We argue though that the issue at stake is not just another reorganization/improvement of the health care system or a better mechanism of integrating scientific progress into existing heath care systems but a reorganization of how we approach health in 21st century societies. In this we follow Peter Drucker\u2019s understanding of innovation as creating a new dimension of performance [8].",

An immediate, if general, policy implication that derives from this conclusion is that policy-makers who are interested in improving economic outcomes (e.g. on the labour market or for the entire economy) would have good reasons to consider investment in health as one of their options by which to meet their economic objectives.\n\n",

Disease has boundaries; health does not. The new health challenges make this blatantly obvious. Within government the stakeholders in the response to obesity are not only the health ministry, but, for example, the ministries of transport, education, agriculture, trade, and consumer affairs. Outside of government the producers of unhealthy food and drink products are as much in focus as are the settings of everyday life where they are consumed (such as canteens), global marketing and advertising practices, the media messages, and the role model celebrities to name but a few. Smoking acts regulate not only who can buy tobacco products, where, and at what price but they define where it is permitted to smoke; in consequence, owners of bars and restaurants, retailers, and the management of airports and railway lines to name but a few, all need to be concerned with health in ways they were not before. Consumers and voters as well as a wide array of health action groups and patient organizations make their preferences heard.",

It is specific to the health society that all four domains \u2013 personal health, public health, medical health,and the health market \u2013 not only continue to change and expand but \u2013 and this is critical \u2013 that the balance between the systems is shifting [28]. The health sector \u2013 consisting of the public health domain and the medical health domain \u2013 struggles to include more health, in the form of strengthening public health, health promotion, and prevention. Yet, this approach is falling short in many countries, in particular for lack of political support, except where the measures are clearly medical, such as expanding screening or strengthening predictive medicine. While the new paradigms in preventative medicine are gaining increasing acceptance, public health measures are considered unduly paternalistic and are seen to impinge on the individual freedom of choice. Structural measures addressing the determinants are also not politically popular, as they usually impinge on one or the other economic interest. There have been excellent policy documents such as the Wanless Report in England [29] that have proposed to embark on an organizational shift within the health sector toward public health, driven in particular by the fear generated by the relentless growth of the medical health domain. They argue that more money needs to be invested in prevention, health promotion, and public health; otherwise, our societies will not be able to afford the constant expansion of the medical health system. So far within the health sector very few policies, institutions, organizations, and funding streams have clearly differentiated between investing for health and the expenditures for providing medical care. Durand-Zalesky makes this point in great detail in the contribution to this book and she underlines how important the political innovation environment is for a public health agenda focused on determinants \u2013 in the case of policy innovation for health the different perceptions of the role of the state, the market and the individuals are critical.",

Politically the pressure is strong to subject every penny of this paltry amount to critical evidence reviews based on a medical mind-set, while to this day most health service organizations are still not accountable for their health outcomes and demonstrate a severe lack of transparency for patients and consumers.

The perception of open innovation now means to involve a broad range of partners in order to find innovative solutions, particularly in the form of innovation clusters. As used to be the case in business, the functional and hierarchical approach in the medical and the public health domains do not usually allow for this. There are therefore very few policy mechanisms that allow decision makers to consider both health determinants and health impacts in an integrated manner and to approach the new health challenges with joined up policy responses, initiatives, and interventions. Usually each policy (sub) domain works to its own logic and intentions without regard for the impact on other areas of society or its global impact.

In many countries a first step to engage a broad range of actors around common goals was the development of health targets[32], an approach that gained ground from the 1980s onward. In order to achieve the targets it became clear that policies in the health sector needed to be complemented by other sectors of government and that they in turn needed to be supported by policy commitments at different levels of government and in the private and nongovernmental sector. The Wanless report calls this the fully engaged scenario [31].

The overlap of unmet medical needs and unmet social needs can only be addressed jointly between patients, providers, and the social support system \u2013 patient input is a prerequisite to developing the kind of integrated disease-management models that most health systems still do not provide because they are out of step with the epidemiological and social development.

Consumers want simplicity, convenience, speed, and a good price [41]. Increasingly the two expectations meet as health systems become increasingly market driven and as patients want more say and have higher expectations. New products and technologies can only develop their full potential if they meet processes and structures that allow them to do so. This implies new forms of information, communication, and integration processes. The Conference Board of Canada in its recent analysis [2] defines three dimensions of high performing health systems: people and culture, technologies, and structure and processes. This is also reflected in the more recent literature on innovation which speaks of a paradigm shift toward a \u201cfluid identity of innovation\u201d [42].

If innovation means a reorganization of how we approach health in 21st century societies, I propose that the following five dynamic processes will be critical. Our societies will need toDevelop a new understanding of health as an investment and productive force in societyDevelop separate governance mechanisms for health and for health care, with a strong focus on accountability for health gainAugment the concern for ethics and values with respect to health through a broad dialogue with citizens in order to increase democratic legitimacy and ensure solidarityMove beyond a narrow understanding of health outcomes in terms of only physical health measures to those that aim to include or even prioritize broader measures of wellbeingEngage in network governance, partnership and multi-stakeholder approaches in rder to achieve health goals.\n",

While our societies have now learned to recognize the urgency of the environmental challenge in terms of long-term sustainability, we are only just beginning to grasp the consequences that our way of life has in terms of health sustainability. An example of developing such a change in mindset are the 10 Health in All Policy principles developed in the South Australian Government in 2007 through a Health in All Polices process [35].",
