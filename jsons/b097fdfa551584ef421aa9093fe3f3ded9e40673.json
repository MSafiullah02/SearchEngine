Accurate prognostication is particularly challenging in the case of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, due to several factors including incomplete and rapidly changing data, challenges in generalizing data between regions, and lack of morbidity and functional outcomes in survivors. The high transmission rate of this virus has led to a worldwide pandemic. This has increased lay discussion about the risk of mortality the virus carries, particularly for older adults and people with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic respiratory disease, cancer or hypertension(1). As we work to provide accurate and personalized recommendations to our patients, we must closely examine available data and apply to our patient populations.",

Data from the Washington Department of Health shows that while one in ten confirmed cases were in adults greater than 80 years of age, this age group accounted for 54% of all deaths(5). This aligns with nationwide CFR that increases with older age, with rates up to 27.3% in those >85 years as reported by the Centers for Disease Control(6).

Of those who were sick enough to require hospitalization in one hospital in Wuhan, China, 28% (54/191) died(4). Older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and elevated d-dimer at admission were risk factors associated with death.

Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS) and older adults were more likely to die, with a median age of 64.6 years of those who died and a median age of 51.9 years for survivors. Similarly, 67% (14/21) patients in a Washington state hospital, the majority of which came from a nursing home, died following intensive care admission, and 24% remained critically ill at the time of reporting (10) . An Italian cohort study demonstrated lower mortality, at 26% (405/1581) (11) . However, the true mortality is likely significantly higher given that 58% (920/1581) of patients remained in the intensive care unit at the time of the publication. As noted with previous studies, mortality significantly worsened with increasing age. (Figure 1) Intubated patients Patients who require mechanical ventilation demonstrate very high mortality rates, ranging from 81-97%(9,12). It is not yet clear whether mortality in the New York system Northwell Health may be different. In their dataset of 1,151 patients who were mechanically ventilated, 3% were discharged alive, 25% had died, and 72% were still in the ICU(8). Therefore we can estimate the mortality is somewhere between 25% and 97%. The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Center in the United Kingdom documented a lower mortality rate when including noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. In their population, patients who required advanced respiratory support, inclusive of BIPAP, CPAP and mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal respiratory support, 67% were dead at the end of their critical care stay (13) . Caution is warranted when looking at these data as they are biased towards reporting patient outcomes of those who died or recovered quickly, and may underreport those with a long duration of mechanical ventilation.",
