In addition, the proportion of lymphocytes decreased in 9 of the elderly patients, which was much higher than that of the young and middle-aged patients. It may be due to changes in the elderly's lung anatomy and muscle atrophy leading to changes in the physiological functions of the respiratory system, reduced airway clearance,7 reduced lung reserve,8 and reduced defense barrier function,9 The level of C-reactive protein in elderly patients is significantly higher than that in the young and middle-aged group, which is similar to MERS-CoV.10 In terms of imaging, the incidence of multilobe lesions in elderly patients is significantly higher than in young and middle-aged patients. CT examination is the most direct and rapid examination method, which can quickly confirm the diagnosis and grasp the changes of the patient's condition to guide the clinical update of the treatment plan.

Large sample study.12, 13 The reason may be that our hospital is the severe treatment base in Hainan Province, which has caused a significant increase in the proportion of severe illness in our hospital and caused an increase in the mortality rate of young people. But the mortality of elderly patients is basically consistent with domestic research.14 Antiviral is particularly important in the treatment of COVID-19, but there are currently no drugs targeting new coronaviruses.15 In this study, the elderly population also received Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets, and the proportion was not significantly different from the young and middle-aged group. At present, from the clinical point of view, the benefit of Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets tablets in the treatment of coronavirus is not obvious. The course of treatment is long and prone to liver and kidney damage. Those with respiratory symptoms were treated with interferon nebulized inhalation and Chinese medicine antiviral treatment. We observed that after using inhaled interferon, the cough symptoms of the elderly patients were relieved faster, and the effect seems to be better than that of the young and middle-aged people.",
