            "text": "Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that is due to the deficiency or absence of a protein necessary for normal blood clotting. Treatment consists of regular injections of antihemophilic factor concentrates given on an ''as needed basis'' (episode-based treatment) or according to a regular schedule of prophylactic infusions (prophylaxis) to prevent bleeding and the debilitating complications that ensue from bleeding into joints, muscles, or vital organs and structures. The National Hemophilia Foundation's MASAC [1] and the Canadian Hemophilia Treatment Center Directors [2] both advise that physicians exercise their best judgment in advising patients about their options in terms of product for treatment of bleeding episodes. The choice of which factor concentrate to use is a difficult decision for parents of young children, adult patients, and their physicians. Factors that impact on this decision (Table I) include availability of individual products, their cost, clinical effectiveness, ''ease of administration,'' and the safety of each product [3] . In 2000, more than three billion international units of recombinant anti-hemophilic factor concentrate were produced [4] . This amount is capable of meeting the needs of only 30% of the world hemophilia population. The issues of cost and cost-benefit of individual anti-hemophilic factor concentrates are beyond the scope of this review. The reader is referred to an excellent review by Giagrande [5] on this topic. Similarly, data on the effectiveness of individual antihemophilic factor concentrates is present in the literature [6, 7] . Prospective trials, retrospective analyses and case reports examining the effectiveness of individual products can be found in the literature and will not be discussed here.",

Over his lifetime he has received more than 2,000 infusions without the development of an inhibitor, an antibody that precludes the function of the infused factor concentrate. During early adolescence, he was treated with a factor concentrate that was contaminated with the virus that causes AIDS-human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). Despite almost 20 years of infection, his viral load is minimal (less than 100 viral genome copies per ml) and his CD4 T-lymphocyte cell counts are moderately reduced despite not ever receiving anti-retroviral therapy. He was also infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) from contaminated factor concentrate and currently has evidence of moderately severe liver dysfunction with prolongation in the Prothrombin time and elevated liver transaminases, for which no therapy has been given.",

It is more than 30 years since the first cases of infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) were reported in patients with hemophilia treated with concentrates made from plasma [12] . From 1971 From to 1975 From and 1975 From to 1979 , the annual incidence of HBV infection was estimated to be 7% and 9.5% [13] . Currently, 90% of HBV seroconversions in patients with hemophilia are attributed to vaccination programs [14] . According to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence of natural or acquired immunity to HBV among the 15,682 people with bleeding disorders participating in the Universal Data Collection (UDC) project [15] appears to be decreasing despite the availability and widespread usage of hepatitis B vaccine in childhood. This suggests that patients may once again be susceptible to HBV infection. The signs and symptoms of hepatitis following infection with HBV are present in about 70% of cases, of which about 5% develop chronic infection and 15%-25% of these individuals die from chronic liver disease [16] .",

To explore this issue, the risks from plasma-derived and recombinant coagulation proteins must be considered by four distinct time eras. The first era was prior to 1970 when plasma and cryoprecipitate were used to treat patients with hemophilia. The second era was during the 1970's and 1980's when low and intermediate purity products derived from human blood were used to control acute bleeding and prevent bleeding with surgery. The third era began in the late 1980's and extends to current time with the use of high purity, monoclonal anti-hemophilic factor concentrate and recombinant products. The fourth era began in 2000 with the licensure of the current sucrose-formulated products [9, 14, [20] [21] [22] [23] .

HAV is a solvent-detergent resistant RNA virus, and parvovirus B 19 is a DNA virus that is heat resistant. The current viral inactivation techniques are not very effective against these agents and filtration techniques are used to remove these infectious microorganisms. HAV and parvovirus B 19 are potentially very difficult to eliminate from factor concentrates once present in source plasma [36] . Therefore, donor screening to eliminate HAV and PB19 from source plasma is critical [36] [37] [38] .",

Moreover, another study indicated the presence of PB19 in young patients with hemophilia A [45] . Similarly, circoviruses are also very resistant to treatment with heat, detergents, and disinfectants. Recent studies have linked novel circoviruses to serious posttransfusion conditions. For example, transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) was discovered in 1998 [46] and linked to post-transfusion hepatitis [46] [47] [48] . For this reason TTV has been of great interest to the hemophilia community. Azzi et al. [49] showed that TTV viral genome was present in firstgeneration recombinant factor VIII and IX concentrates. On the other hand, the second-generation factor VIII product Refacto and recombinant factor IX (Benefix) did not contain TTV. Recently, the most common factor IX products, Mononine and Benefix, used to treat hemophilia B were shown not to contain TTV [50] .",

From this point on HGV will be used to refer to GBV-C. HGV is a member of the Flaviviridae family and its genome is similar to that of HCV. HGV has been found in FVIII concentrates and has been associated with acute and persistent hepatitis in humans. The long-term clinical significance of such an infection remains uncertain. In general, human HGV infection appears to be mild or clinically silent [31] . There have, however, been a few cases of fulminate hepatitis associated with HGV infection reported [51] . In addition, a recent study questions the cause or effect relationship between HGV and HIV progression. The detection of HGV RNA in blood products and in plasmaderived products further raises questions regarding blood safety [53] . Additionally, HGV's prevalence is well established. For instance, 1.72% of US blood donors are infected with this virus [54] , whereas in Japan the prevalence is 0.9% [55] . In hemophilia patients the prevalence rate rises to 18% [54] . If blood products are not treated with specific virucidal methods, it is likely that HGV will be present in factor concentrates.",

In 1999, an outbreak of WNV in New York City deeply worried the scientific community in regards to contaminated blood supply used for transfusions. In 2000, WNV went dormant in the USA; only to re-appear in 2001. The infection quickly spread. In 2002, 4 patients received organ donations from the same person. All 4 developed WNV infection. The incident sparked the need to test the blood supply for WNV. That year, a minimum of 21 cases of transfusion-borne WNV infections were identified. The American Red Cross confirmed that 0.01% of blood donations tested positive for WNV (415 of 4.1 million donors). In some states the rate of infection is much higher, as in Kansas where it was 1:243 [31] . Nucleic acid testing (NAT) for WNV was licensed by the FDA in 2000. Importantly, virus inactivation steps commonly used during the manufacture of plasma derivatives, such as pasteurization for human albumin, solvent/detergent treatment for IVIG and FVIII, and vapor heating for FVIII inhibitor-bypassing activity, readily inactivate WNV essentially eliminating this virus from the source plasma [56] .",

Umemura and coworkers showed the presence of SENV DNA (strains D or H) in 86/286 patients who received blood transfusions during surgery [59] . This rate is 10 times higher than in cases where no transfusions were performed. Moreover, it was observed during post-transfusion follow-up, that newly acquired SENV infections were present in 92% of patients with non-A to E hepatitis and only 24% of patients who did not develop post-transfusion hepatitis; hence suggesting a link between non-A to E hepatitis and SENV [59] .

The advantages of recombinant factor concentrates include theoretical improvements in microbiological safety. However, this improvement is not without increased cost of therapy. There is no evidence to suspect that recombinant products are more prone to induce the development of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII or to be associated with allergic or other adverse events. For newly diagnosed and infection-naive patients, similar to those described in cases 2 and 3 respectively, recombinant factor concentrates offer the benefits of reduced microbiological exposures. With respect to the different recombinant products, those formulated without animal or human proteins should be preferred as the microbiological risk, however small or theoretical, is likely to be further reduced, virtually eliminating the possibility of blood-borne infectious disease. At times in the past, shortages of factor concentrates due to manufacturing regulatory issues have led to ''rationing'' of products. If in the future, recombinant products are again scarce, the youngest and previously un-exposed should preferentially receive priority for any available product.",

For example, the diminished hepatocellular disease in HIVinfected individuals co-infected with HCV when compared to those with HCV alone is due to the lack of an immune response against the HCV [53] . Unfortunately, co-infection with another agent, including emerging infections is likely to result in a less favorable clinical course, increasing the virulence of the pre-existing infection. The patient described in case 1 is such an individual who already is infected with HIV and HCV. The introduction of another infection may result in progression of one or both of the pre-existing infections. Therefore, irrespective of the infectious disease status of the patient with hemophilia, all should be afforded the opportunity to receive the safest factor concentrate, a recombinant product formulated without the addition of animal or human proteins and at a reasonable cost. Table IV summarizes the quintessential issues in choosing between a plasma-derived, monoclonal antibody purified factor concentrate and a recombinant factor VIII product. In Table V , the products available in the USA to treat hemophilia are reviewed. All are treated to inactive viruses, demonstrate similar clinical efficacy to treat and prevent bleeding as well as show no difference in the induction of inhibitors. The single distinguishing feature is the possibility of exposure to an unanticipated infectious agent that causes human disease. It is this difference, whether real or potential, that currently plays most heavily in the decision making process of physicians who prescribe anti-hemophilic factor concentrates and the patients and parents who use these life-saving drugs.",
