Even though Brazil is considered for the scope of this paper, the techniques and tools used in this study can be easily adapted for any other country. The impact of different control strategies are qualitatively evaluated and mathematically based guidelines concerning different protective measures and quarantine strategies are formulated. The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the age-structured SEIR model with quarantine is formulated. Demographic data from Brazil is introduced and discussed. In Section 3, the classical SEIR model without vital dynamics and with a quarantine compartment is studied. The goals here are, firstly, to adjust parameters and to fit the real data, and secondly, to study the necessary quarantine efforts and times so to be able to influence the epidemic. In Section 4, the parameters for the age structured model are adjusted (using the ones calculated on the previous section). The next generation approach is used to calculate the basic reproduction number and a sensibility analysis is carried on. In Section 5, different quarantine strategies are considered and compared. We draw our conclusions in 6.",

The important feature on Figure 3 is the existence of a threshold value for the epidemic effort. For values greater than this critical value, the maximum number of infected decreases extremely fast and the maximum time essentially stabilizes. This is a common feature for all p and \u03bb as shown in figure 5 . Critical values for quarantine efforts are clearly seen for the contour plots for the maximum number of infected.

With our terminology, this means considering a strategy S5 defined by p 1 = p 2 = 0 and p 3 = p. However, this leads to two main problems: first, due to the small percentage of the elder class the quarantine effort would be to small (in fact smaller then 0.1) to be of any significance. Second, it would allow for a much higher number of infected individuals (see Figure 12) , hence a great increase in the total of hospitalizations, which would collapse the Health System. Therefore, to achieve better quarantine results, the total effort needs to include all age-groups, with more emphasis on the elderly since they have a higher fatality rate due to the disease. Notice that strategy S2 is, by far, the best among these. All other strategies end up with, at least, 7.5% more deaths. We can also analyse the strategies by plotting them. Let \u00b5 i , i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}, be the death rates from Table 4 , so converges to the total amount of deaths that result from strategy S j , j \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4}. Figure 13 plots the graphs of D j (t), normalized by lim t\u2192\u221e D 2 (t), produced by the four strategies for different values of p. Notice yet that, in all four cases, the strategy that produces the smallest limit value (hence the smallest death toll) is S2.",

Three age classes were used: infants (0 to 19 years), adults (20 to 59 years) and elderly (60 to 100 years). First we studied the associated classical unstructured SEIR model without vital dynamics. The parameters were fitted by a least-square algorithm and the impact of the quarantine parameters p and \u03bb were studied. Our main findings concern the existence of a numerical threshold value for the quarantine parameters: above a certain curve on the (p, \u03bb)-plane, the maximum number of infected decreases in an accentuated way. This shows that an abrupt decline on the number of cases should be observed if the quarantine is being efficient. If this decline is not being observed, quarantine effort and time should be increased. The parameters obtained for the unstructured SEIR model were used to adjust the parameters for the age-structured SEIR model. Using this data, the basic reproduction number R 0 was calculated and its dependence on the epidemic values was studied. Our findings for the R 0 analysis are as follows:",
