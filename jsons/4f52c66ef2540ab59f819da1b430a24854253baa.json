Like all outbreaks, the first possible psychological response of the general population is fear and panic of being infected. They also fear that the epidemic will continue. At present, there is a lot of information about the epidemic on the Internet. We don't know whether it is true or false. Because of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, we cancelled all kinds of parties and could only stay at home, so life was boring. At this time, some people may have anxiety, depression, despair, anger and other emotional reactions (Xiang et al., 2020) . People buy a lot of things by hearsay, such as masks, disinfectants and even vegetables in supermarkets.",

To solve these mental health problems, the local government of Xianning City, which is adjacent to Wuhan City, implemented the helpful policies in time. As psychiatrists can play pivotal role in supporting the well-being of those affected and their families, the at-risk healthcare staff as well as the public (Banerjee, 2020) , the local government have organized psychological consultation team and mental health team to provide free psychological consultation service to relieve J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the psychological pressure of the masses. Because people are isolated at home, the traditional face-to-face psychological consultation becomes impossible. Basically, all psychological counseling is carried out through non-contact way. Contacting by phone, QQ or WeChat, \"one-to-one\" psychological counseling can be carried out. The network also provides a variety of free movies and TV plays for the public to enjoy. As an affiliated hospital of the local medical college, our hospital has set up a psychological intervention group. The professional psychological doctors who have received the psychological assistance training in response to the 2019-nCoV provide psychological consultation for the public. Some experts argue that it is debatable whether such interventions are universally appropriate for targeted populations, which include lay people, frontline responders, and family members of patients with COVID-19 (Yao et al., 2020) . But in the case of isolation of the whole country, online psychological consultation is the only way to be adopted, which is better than nothing. Our practice also proves that most of the psychological pressure of the people who accept these interventions has been relieved.",
