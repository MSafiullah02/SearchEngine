            "text": "Some limitations may affect this project\u2019s generalizability to other settings and the precision of the findings. First, measuring readmissions at the population level of hospitalized children means that the team could not ascertain reasons for individual readmissions. The case-mix of patients and reasons for hospitalization may differ from those in other institutions in undetectable ways. However, the population-level approach is also a strength. Including all discharged children and providers on the general pediatric services in this project has led to buy-in and sustainment in the institution. Second, implementation in a real-world context is resource-intensive and limited the ability to implement all intervention components for the duration of the project. In particular, staff capacity limited rates of completed, 3-day follow-up calls (10.9%), and screening for and addressing adverse SDH (28.7%). It may be that low rates of completion obscure any potential effect of these components on readmission rates. Future efforts should include dedicated staff for these time-intensive functions and can be adapted to align with institutional priorities. Third, since components of the intervention were not all implemented for the full duration of the project, it is not possible to ascertain the effects of individual components apart from the whole. Finally, other factors we could not account for could have affected readmission rates. For example, heightened attention to readmissions by policymakers and payers could have led clinicians to invest additional effort to prevent them.",
