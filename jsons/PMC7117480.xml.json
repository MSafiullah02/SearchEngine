            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a member of the genus Deltacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and mortality in nursing pigs (Jung et al., 2015, Lau et al., 2012). In the US, PDCoV was reported from clinical cases of diarrhea in young pigs in early 2014 by Wang et al. in Ohio (Wang et al., 2014), Marthaler et al. in Illinois (Marthaler et al., 2014), and Li et al. in Iowa (Li et al., 2014). The virus has spread continuously nationwide, causing deaths among nursing pigs. The disease is clinically and pathologically similar to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Jung et al., 2015), but with reportedly lower mortality rates. Experimental infection studies showed that PDCoV infects large numbers of villous epithelial cells of the small intestine at 3\u20134 days after oral inoculation (Chen et al., 2015, Jung et al., 2015). Infected enterocytes appeared to acutely undergo vacuolar, or hydropic, degeneration and exfoliated extensively from the villous epithelium, followed by villous atrophy (Chen et al., 2015, Jung et al., 2015). This process appeared to be associated with necrosis of infected cells. However, further studies are needed to verify whether PDCoV-infected enterocytes in vivo undergo necrosis or apoptosis.",

The morphological changes in PDCoV-infected LLC-PK and ST cells were similar and included enlarged, rounded, and densely granular cells that occurred singly or in clusters and then, cell shrinkage and detachment that resembled the process of apoptotic cell death (Hu et al., 2015); however, further studies are also required to clarify the mechanisms of cell death. Therefore, our study aimed to define by which cell death mechanism, necrosis or apoptosis, PDCoV causes deaths of infected enterocytes in vivo and infected LLC-PK or ST cells in vitro.",

The viral RNA titer of the OH-FD22-P44 used in this study was 9.9 log10\n GE/ml, and the infectious titer was 9.7 log10 plaque forming units/ml. When a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 was used for viral inoculation in LLC-PK and ST cells, a diffuse (up to 100%) cell clumping and moderate cell detachment as cytopathic effects (CPE) was generally observed in LLC-PK cells (treated with 2.5\u201310 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin) and ST cells (treated with 1% pancreatin) at PID 1. On the other hand, when a MOI of 0.01 was used for viral inoculation in LLC-PK and ST cells, only a 2\u20135% CPE was observed at PID 1 but a sudden, complete cell detachment was observed at PID 1.5\u20132 in LLC-PK cells (treated with 2.5\u201310 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin) and ST cells (treated with 1% pancreatin). Therefore, a MOI of 0.1 was used for viral inoculation in LLC-PK and ST cells for an adequate detection of apoptotic cell death as tested at PID 1 and earlier time-points. Compared with the original OH-FD22 strain, OH-FD22-P11 and -P20, passaged in both ST and LLC-PK cells, each had five nucleotide changes in the S genes (Hu et al., 2015). In both cell culture lines, the mutations observed at P11 were sustained through P40, with 100% nucleotide identity in P11, P20, and P40 (Hu et al., 2015, unpublished data). The pathogenicity of the OH-FD22-P40 in inoculated Gn pigs also appeared to be similar to that of the original field OH-FD22 virus (Hu et al., 2015, unpublished data).",

In general, acute vacuolation or swelling of cytoplasm characterizes cell death caused by hypoxia as a result of failure of the sodium\u2013potasium ion pump mechanism (Jones et al., 1997). Cytolytic viruses cause necrosis of infected cells by interfering with their ability to synthesize proteins and produce energy essential for maintaining cell life and homeostasis; and mechanically damaging cellular organelles and membranes with accumulations of large amounts of viral nucleic acids and/or proteins (Jones et al., 1997). We speculate that these are possible causes of vacuolar degeneration and death of PDCoV-infected enterocytes in vivo.",

The latter example includes classical swine fever virus (CSFV) causing no death of infected SWC3+ granulocytes as the major replication site of the virus in infected pigs, but apoptosis of bystander cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Ganges et al., 2008). Viral inhibition of necrosis or apoptotic cell death of infected cells may also prolong survival of intracellular virus (Miller and Fox, 2004). In contrast to the capacity of PDCoV to induce necrosis of infected enterocytes in vivo, death of PDCoV-infected LLC-PK or ST cells is via apoptosis, directly related to viral infection and replication. In our study, TUNEL-positive signals (apoptotic nuclear fragmentation) were mostly in LLC-PK or ST cells positive for both PDCoV antigen and virus-induced CPE. Our study also identified increased numbers of inoculated LLC-PK or ST cells positive for annexin V as a marker of one of early apoptosis-related physiological changes, cell membrane alteration. Based on our annexin V/PI staining results, in LLC-PK cells at 21 h after inoculation, the cells positive for both annexin V and PI might include late-stage apoptotic cells or necrotic cells. On the other hand, in ST cells at 21 h after inoculation when the extent of CPE was similar to that in inoculated LLC-PK cells, there were both early-stage apoptotic cells and late-stage apoptotic cells or necrotic cells.",

For efficient replication and survival in each environment, PEDV and TGEV likely induce vacuolar degeneration or necrosis of infected enterocytes in vivo (Jung and Saif, 2015, Kim et al., 2000), whereas they also cause apoptotic cell death of infected Vero (Kim and Lee, 2014) or ST cells (Eleouet et al., 1998) in vitro. Based on these observations, a study of the mechanisms related to cell death caused by PEDV, TGEV, or PDCoV in in vitro conditions may not be applicable for the comprehensive understanding of cell death of infected enterocytes that occurs in vivo. Our findings indicate the necessity of an in vitro system to be able to better mimic in vivo conditions, such as intestinal enteroids or organoids (Finkbeiner et al., 2012), and also implicate the limited in vivo significance of the cell death studies related to in vitro observations.",
