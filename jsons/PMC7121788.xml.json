            "text": "In August 2014, the worst Ebola outbreak on record conceded by the World Health Organization had become an international public health emergent event. Communication channels during times of emerging social crises and natural disasters play an important role before, during, and after such events, and social media have become important channels for communications with the advancement of Internet communication technology. However, emerging social issues have often led to rumor breeding and propagation in social media in China. Public health-related rumors will harm social stability, and such noise negatively affects the quality of disease outbreak detection and prediction based on social media. To study the diffusion of social media rumor towards such social events, in this chapter we present a case study of the diffusion of Ebola rumors in social media networks in China along with the outbreak period.",

            "text": "This chapter contributes to the literatures as an empirical study to apply social media and volunteered geographic data to understand human behavior and social phenomena. Recently a new source of geographic information has become available through user-generated efforts, enabled by technologies loosely regarded as Web 2.0 (Goodchild 2007). Geographic information can now be found in the contents of wikis, blogs, tweets, photos, and many other forms of user-generated content. Goodchild defines this new source of data as volunteered geographic information (VGI), which emphasizes the role of voluntary efforts in producing geographic information, to differentiate with the conventional geographic information production process. Sui (2008) further pointed out that VGI has transformed the conventional way in how geographic information is created and used so it represents a \u201cwikification\u201d of GIS, which is not simply confined to new ways of data productions but also includes the development of GIS software, hardware, organizations, and people. Already we have witnessed the popularity of VGI has provided many research opportunities for geographers and GIScientists in the digital age. Many studies found out VGI to be a valuable source because of its huge potential to engage citizens and to be a significant, timely, and cost-effective source for geographers\u2019 understanding of the earth (Yang et al. 2016). Our study resonates some other recent successful cases using VGI to help disaster relief, such as the provision of useful location-based information to the victims after the 7.0 earthquake in Haiti in 2010 and the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in 2011 (Zook et al. 2010; Yap et al. 2012).",

Scholars have also explored how social media information conveyed issues in public health (Hay et al. 2013). For example, Windener (Widener and Li 2014) used sentiment analysis to explore the prevalence of healthy and unhealthy food in the USA. King et al. (2013) analyzed the role of social media in informing, debating and influencing opinions in a specific area of health policy.",

            "text": "People began to realize that we have an extremely poor knowledge of how the vast majority of infectious diseases spread across spatial scales (Hay et al. 2013). The process of understanding starts with records of disease occurrences estimated from the literature (Rogers et al. 2006), reports of disease distribution on the web (Brownstein et al. 2008), and the trends suggested by GenBank (Benson et al. 2012). Together, these could be used to define a definitive extent of the disease (Brady et al. 2012) and to populate a database of occurrence locations (i.e., points) where the disease had been reported. For example, Messina et al. (2014) manually built a comprehensive global database of confirmed human dengue infection in March 2014, consisting of 8309 geo-positioned occurrence. However, it is labor-intensive to keep track of the current trend of infectious diseases and distribution. It should be noted that social media messages are self-reported volunteered information, unlike those from official or government outlets with delayed announcements. Tweets can be used to track and predict the emergence and spread of an epidemic (Achrekar et al. 2011; Velardi et al. 2014). The spatial pattern of flu risk was dynamically mapped across various spatial and temporal scales by FluMapper (Padmanabhan et al. 2014).",

Rumors can be thought as a message or a communication between people about certain events or certain issues of concern that may or may not correspond to the truth (Mullen 1972). Rumors not only communicate messages but also emerge a form of interactions among people in a group of individuals when they face the threat of a crisis (Indrawan-Santiago et al. 2014; Peterson and Gist 1951; Rosnow 1988). Social media platforms, such as Twitter and microblog, sometimes spread wrong information or rumor because they are citizen-based non-professional media. However, some information with reliable sources can minimize rumor propagation, suppressing the level of anxiety in the virtual community (Indrawan-Santiago et al. 2014; Oh et al. 2010; Okada et al. 2014; Spiro et al. 2012; Starbird et al. 2014). The social media messages containing rumors are different from those spreading news (Mendoza et al. 2010). Liao and Shi (2013) also reported the spreading of rumor during a nation-scale scandal using microblog.",

In September 2014, the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) predicted that 1.4 million people in Sierra Leone and Liberia would have succumbed to the disease if the epidemic continued its swift spread (Epstein 2014). Ebola has been frequently highlighted by newspaper, TV, and social media, after the virus has spread into many countries and has taken a lot of lives in 2014. More than 10 million tweets mentioned the word \u201cEbola\u201d on Twitter within 20 days from 15 September 2014 in 170 countries (Luckerson 2014).",

Along with the advancement of Internet technology, the spread of messages through social media had become much accelerated, more specific, and more short-lived than before. With constantly emerging social issues to prompt new rumors, the Internet actually provided an incubator for rumors to grow. This is understandable when considering that social media users came from all walks of life and participations in social media were very much unstructured and unorganized. As a results, social media, although not intentionally, nurture and spread rumors (Jin et al. 2014). Due to the widespread fear of Ebola and the lack of timely and transparent reporting of Ebola cases to the general public, rumors about Ebola infection possessed the two critical elements of Ebola infection being an important issue and the ambiguity in all news and reports about it. As a result, Ebola infection was widely discussed on social media.",

The posts in Sina Weibo reached the number of more than 2.8 billion in December, 2013. Sina Weibo provides developers with APIs (application programming interface) to facilitate users to extend application in Weibo. A limited sample of Sina Weibo can be collected through the official API. However, this will pose significant limitations on the detail of microblogs and the amount of data. Because web pages are unstructured, most crawlers are based on the simple definitions of the scope of web pages, which are subject to efficiency analysis (Plachouras et al. 2014). We then use a hybrid method, by integrating the API with a web crawler developed by our own to harvest the experimental data used in this study. In mid-October 2014, a rumor was spread on the Internet (Sohu 2014) about China\u2019s first Ebola-infected patient who was found in Ningbo, a coastal city in southeast China. This rumor also claimed the mortality rate of Ebola disease to be more than 90%. Almost in the same time, similar rumors about Ebola emerged in Guangzhou, another coastal city situated at the Pearl River delta (Xinhuanet 2014). Given the similarity of the characteristic of these two cities, we take the rumors in Ningbo and Guangzhou as our research objects. Considering the rumors may have some pre-warning stage, we began collecting data from the first day of October, 2014. To capture a full cycle of rumor diffusion process, we set the duration of our data collection as 60 days.",

Communication channels during times of emerging social crises and natural disasters are critical before, during, and after such events. Our study shows that social media messages are rich in content, which are ideal to capture and reflect a multitude of aspects of attitude, behaviors, and reactions of social media users to a specific topic or event. We thus argue that there is a pressing need to understand social media use during natural disasters and emergent social event from the perspective of social media users and affected citizens. This is also reflected in other study indicating that during a disaster, affected citizens are usually the most valuable sources who are capable of providing information before the public channel and agency. Therefore, it has been widely acknowledged that Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief ( HADR) responders can gain valuable insights and situational awareness by monitoring social media and volunteered geographic information related to the emergent event (that study also examined a set of factors that can explain those uses, such as time of the tweets, the location and characteristics of the users, previous patterns of social media use, and the degree to which the crisis has directly or indirectly affected the users). Therefore, these messages can be used to monitor and track geopolitical and disaster events, support emergency response and coordination, and serve as a measure of public interest or concern about events (Huang and Xiao 2015).",

The specific Ebola rates and trends are not included in this paper because we want to address the rumors spread in social media and not the detection and prediction of the spread of influenza. There is no Ebola patient found in China in the incidence. In terms of temporal dimension, across the two cities that Weibo messages were collected from, Weibo rates and rumor rates both peaked around 23 November 2014, and both peaked on 11 o\u2019clock in 1 day. Though Weibo is not the birthplace of the original rumor, it facilitates its spread because most Weibo users are anonymous. Driven by fear, the rumor spread demonstrates a fast outbreak within very short time period. LDA method illustrates that rumors relate to real events associated with Ebola, which represents the collective efforts in the context of emergency (Peterson and Gist 1951; Rosnow 1988). In addition, rumors have localized spatial pattern. The advantages to using social media to survey rumor incidence is that it not only would quicken response time for official, but also it would give a various aspects, which will help us to find the sources and reason, about the rumors. When a rumor spreads, it will spread to social network in a few hours or in seconds even. The topics discussed in Weibo about Ebola rumor show us the source of rumor, the event, and focus of people.",

According to a report in 2013, about 53% of users are under 23 years old, who might be significantly affected by rumors (Bai 2014). In the growing social media platform, millions of people create, share, and exchange information and thoughts. Further research can be investigated in other rumors with various spatiotemporal features.
