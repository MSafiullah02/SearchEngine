The PCR is used for initial detection of DNA and so is most useful for detection of infectious agents that contain DNA as their primary genetic material. Because the PCR is incapable of detecting RNA, in order to detect infectious agents that have RNA as their primary genetic material (many viruses for example), a copy of DNA (cDNA) can be made from the infectious agent's RNA through the process of reverse transcription (RT). Transcription normally produces a messenger RNA from a DNA template; the enzyme reverse transcriptase promotes the synthesis of a DNA molecule from an RNA template. Once the cDNA has been synthesized, a PCR can be performed subsequently, and the entire process is referred to as RT-PCR.",

            "text": "The PCR uses short single-stranded segments of nucleotides, called primers, the sequences of which are complimentary to DNA sequences of the intended target DNA, for example, the DNA of an infectious organism. Primers serve as the initial template upon which a new DNA molecule can be synthesized. The primers and other necessary reagents of the PCR are added to a volume of solution containing representative DNA from the sample of interest, including host DNA and DNA from the intended target of detection. The test sample can be anything that could harbor the agent of interest such as tissue, fluids such as urine or blood, stool, or others. The reaction mix is heated to separate DNA into its two strands, then cooled to allow primers to bind to complimentary regions of denatured target DNA. The reaction then is heated again in an extension step to promote the addition of nucleotides to the primer ends, thus building a \u201cnew\u201d strand of DNA. The PCR cocktail is subjected to 25 to 40 cycles of heating and cooling to preferentially amplify target DNA segments. Amplification occurs on a geometric scale; theoretically, one copy of the target DNA sequence can be amplified to over 30 million copies in 25 cycles. The PCR products, or amplicons, are detected most commonly by using gel electrophoresis. The presence of target DNA in the test sample is suggested by observation of a specific and predicted size DNA band in the gel (Fig. 1\n).",

In these instances, some or all of the DNA sequence of the infectious agent must be known to design agent-specific primers. The PCR can be used, however, to cast a wider net in cases in which an infectious agent is suspected, but for which specific sequence information is not available, or in which the presence of an infectious disease is suspected, but one is unsure of which specific agent is present. In these situations, instead of performing the PCR with primers that are specific for a single agent, universal primers can be designed to amplify a segment of a gene that retains a high degree of sequence similarity, or homology, among a large group of related infectious organisms. Related is a relative term when used in this sense and could refer to organisms related by genus, family, or more broadly still as for example all prokaryotic bacteria. One example of this broad-based approach is illustrated by detection of the gene encoding the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of prokaryotic bacteria, a gene that maintains a high degree of homology across many genera of bacteria. If a product is amplified using these universal primers, the presence of bacterial DNA in the reaction is established. The reaction amplicons are analyzed by sequencing or other strategies, and the identity of the agent established by documenting similarities to organisms already existing in large databases.",

Amplicons obtained from universal primer PCR can be sequenced, with the sequence analysis then suggesting a specific genus, or perhaps a specific species, of organism. Sequences that are identified as unique to the 16S rRNA gene or other genes of the detected organism then become the foundation for design of the next set of specific primers. Thus, one has gone from casting a broad net with universal primers to the development of a focused PCR in just a few steps. Such a strategy was employed in the development of a PCR assay specific for Haemobartonella felis\n[1].",

Confirmation of the specificity is particularly crucial when assays first are developed or are applied to new sample types that represent a different pool of DNA than that in which the assay was developed. Among the methods that can confirm amplicon specificity, DNA hybridization, amplicon sequencing, and analysis of restriction enzyme digestion patterns are among the most commonly used. DNA hybridization uses a short DNA segment that is labeled to permit detection and which recognizes a sequence within the amplicon flanked by the primer binding sites. Detection of the probe will occur only when the probe has become bound to its complementary sequence in the amplicon and is retained through several washes that remove unbound probe. Obtaining a predicted sequence in the amplicon following sequence analysis also confirms the specificity of the amplification.",

The PCR is typically also very sensitive because of its ability to detect very small numbers of target DNA. Modifications of the PCR have been developed to further increase the sensitivity of the PCR, typically by adding a small volume containing amplicons from a first reaction to a second PCR. The primers of the second PCR are complementary to sequences of the amplicons from the first reaction, a technique known as nested PCR.

It is possible that in the future, assays relying on this technology may be available in a bedside format accessible to the practitioner or staff. Indeed, such bedside assays are already appearing in the human medical field and are considered standard approaches to the diagnosis of some infections of people [2]. In the meantime, the practitioner still has access to some of these laboratory-based assays as samples, such as tissue and fluids (blood, effusions, and others), usually are easily acquired and submitted. Any special collection or handling requirements as set forth by the laboratory should be understood before sample acquisition and submission. It is important to recognize that not all laboratories will be in a position to offer all available PCR-based assays for infectious disease diagnosis, and samples submitted to one laboratory for a given test may be sent to a different laboratory better equipped to perform the assay.

            "text": "Another technique that has seen somewhat limited applications in small animals is the use of labeled genetic probes to identify the nucleic acid of an infectious agent within a particular cell or tissue type, a technique known as in situ hybridization. In situ hybridization, like the PCR-based assays, takes advantage of the fact that complementary DNA sequences will bind to each other with high affinities. Thus, a probe with a complementary sequence to a known gene can be labeled to permit easy detection, and the probe added, under appropriate conditions, to a sample with cells or tissues to see if the target nucleic acid is present. In situ hybridization thus generally requires a priori knowledge of the organism that is being sought, as the probes tend to be organism-specific. Because in situ hybridization, like in situ PCR, can associate the nucleic acid of an infectious agent with a particular cell or tissue type, in situ hybridization can be a powerful tool for elucidating cell tropism of infectious agents, often a key to the pathophysiology of infectious diseases. For example, in situ hybridization has been used to localize feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) to particular cells in the thymus [4], canine and feline herpesvirus to a number of tissues [5], [6], and H felis on erythrocytes [7].",

The author is aware of no published studies in which RDA has been used to establish the diagnosis of an infectious disease in small animal patients.

The cultured organisms often are referred to as expression vectors, since the proteins encoded by the inserted DNA sequence can be produced, or expressed, in detectable quantities in culture. In so doing, a library of DNA, or cDNA if starting from RNA, is generated and can be analyzed by a number of methods. With one technique, nucleic acids are collected from an individual with the suspected infectious disease, and the nucleic acid cloned, or inserted, into an expression vector. Each of the clones generated is cultured, with the clones producing proteins encoded by the inserted genes. The patient's serum then is used to screen each of the cultured clones for the production of proteins recognized by the patient's antibodies. Clones recognized by patient antibodies then are analyzed to establish a putative identity of the clone based on its similarity to other pathogens or organisms. This technique was used to establish the identity of a new hepatitis virus in people associated with transfusion-associated hepatitis [10]. To accomplish this feat, the investigators had to screen approximately one million clones to find one that produced a candidate infectious disease antigen.",

Although very useful in the assessment of dogs and cats for infectious diseases, the molecular assays are not without limitations. For example, the extreme sensitivity of the PCR is also its biggest limitation, as false positive results can occur with even minute contamination of test samples or reactions. Contamination can occur during sample collection or during the course of performing the PCR. It is important to know that the laboratory has taken relevant steps to eliminate contamination and to ensure that a positive result is truly positive and not a reflection of assay contamination. The extreme sensitivity of the PCR is the biggest obstacle to routine use of universal primer PCR as a diagnostic tool, as contamination with bacteria at any step has the potential to result in a false-positive reaction. Thus, universal primer PCR is better for detection of organisms in normally sterile sites, such as blood, nonepithelial tissues, or other locations from which samples can be obtained aseptically.",

Performing the assay on an inappropriate sample also could cause false-negative results. For example, the sensitivity of detection of canine distemper virus in one experimental study improved if whole blood, serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested by RT-PCR, as any one of these samples from any given dog could be negative [11]. Another theoretical cause of false-negative results would be changes in an organism's nucleic acid sequences that preclude primer binding during the annealing step of the PCR.

Likewise, a negative result would not guarantee that an infectious agent is not responsible for the clinical disease observed. A microbial toxin produced at a site distant from the tissue sampled for the assay may be responsible for the clinical disease and thus would not be detected in the molecular assays. As previously suggested, a variant of the organism not recognized by a particular primer pair would lead to a false-negative result in the face of infection.

It is likely that nucleic acids persist in the host after the death of an organism, and although the duration of DNA persistence often is presumed to be less than a few weeks, the actual duration of DNA persistence following organism death is not known. One group of investigators of acute Rocky Mountain spotted fever was surprised to find that PCR results for Rickettsia rickettsii were positive for at least 8 days beyond the last positive culture [13], a combination of results that would be consistent with the persistence of DNA for a time after all detectably viable organisms had been eliminated from the host. Modifications of the PCR can provide quantitative information regarding the copy numbers (numbers of identical DNA segments in the test sample) of nucleic acid present, which in most instances would be interpreted to reflect the number of organisms actually present in the sample. Thus, a decline in copy number following a therapeutic intervention would be consistent with a therapeutic response. Such an approach could prove more helpful in assessing responses to therapy as compared with a nonquantitative assay. The RT-PCR has been suggested as more useful than PCR assays to monitor responses to therapy [14]. RNA is typically more labile than DNA. Free RNA, or RNA that is not involved in protein synthesis as might occur with the death of an infectious agent, typically is quickly destroyed by host RNAses, enzymes that destroy RNA. Thus, the argument holds that if RNA from an infectious organism is detected in an RT-PCR assay, the presence of viable organisms is implied. RT-PCR-based testing of viral load is standard for people infected with HIV-1 [15].",

Molecular biological assays, however, do offer particular advantages over traditional methods of infection diagnosis in certain clinical settings. The molecular assays can also be complementary to the traditional approaches. Advantages to the molecular approaches can include more rapid confirmation of the presence or absence of a particular pathogen; the assays, especially the PCR and RT-PCR, have the potential to be completed within 24 to 48 hours of the laboratory's receipt of the sample, including time needed for sample processing. This compares favorably to the days or weeks sometimes required for cultures to be declared positive or negative. The time advantage is dependent on the turnaround times of the laboratory, however, which could reflect demand for the assay and strategies that minimize expense of the assay. Another advantage of the molecular assays is that, since recovery of viable organisms is typically not a goal of the molecular assays, there is no need to use special media for transport of many samples, which makes sample acquisition easier for most in private practice. Depending on the assay and the laboratory, some PCR assays can be cost-competitive with traditional approaches.",

For infections such as these, serologic assays often add supportive evidence of infection, but the confidence provided by positive serology can be slim in some clinical situations. Thus, detection of the molecular footprints in a seropositive animal would add an extra degree of confidence in a diagnosis. For example, detection of leptospiral DNA in the blood or urine of a dog with clinical signs would provide strong evidence of infection and could provide evidence of serovar-specific infection supported by antibody titers that are high against that particular serovar. These assays also have the potential to clarify whether young animals that are antibody positive to an infectious disease are infected, or are positive simply because of maternally derived antibodies. Clarification of the infection status of kittens that are positive for antibodies to FIV could be clarified by PCR assays that detect the FIV provirus in feline blood cells were one commercially available.",

These assays also have tremendous potential to define new causes of infectious disease, be it detection of variants of well-known organisms, or perhaps even novel infectious causes of well-characterized clinical syndromes that have defied etiologic description. Recently, an ehrlichial-like syndrome was observed in dogs that were negative for Ehrlichia canis by an E canis-specific PCR routinely used by the investigators. Using primers specific for the Ehrlichia genus 16S ribosomal RNA gene, the investigators were able to amplify ehrlichial DNA from the clinical patients [31]. Sequence and DNA hybridization analysis of this amplicon suggested that the dog was infected with E ruminantium, an ehrlichial agent not previously associated with clinical disease in dogs. The investigators were careful to state that detection of the DNA of this ehrlichial organism was not definitive proof that the infection was the cause of the dog's clinical disease, but their finding certainly raises that possibility.",

First and foremost, the clinician needs to ask if it is likely that the infectious organism is truly responsible for the clinical signs or other abnormalities detected in the patient. In many cases, the association will be suggested because of well-established links between the infectious agent and clinical signs (eg, acute fever, petechial hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia in a dog with R rickettsii). In other cases, the link may be more difficult to discern, as for example a cat with signs of hemolytic anemia and detection of Haemobartonella by a PCR. Although it is known that Haemobartonella can cause hemolytic anemia, it is also known that there are other causes of hemolytic anemia in cats, and that many cats are asymptomatic carriers of Haemobartonella. Thus, a PCR-positive blood sample would not guarantee that hemolytic anemia was caused by Haemobartonella felis infection. Likewise, T gondii parasitemia has been documented in experimentally infected cats that show no clinical signs of infection [33]. Thus, a cat demonstrating signs of neurological or respiratory disease that was positive for T gondii on the basis of a PCR on a blood sample may or may not have clinical toxoplasmosis. The strength of disease association in such an instance would be bolstered by a positive result from a tissue lesion. Thus, as is the case with interpretation of other diagnostic tests for infectious organisms, an understanding of the biology of the infection is also important for proper interpretation of results of molecular assays.",

It is likely that additional applications of these tools to small animal medicine will become apparent as investigators use and refine them for their research purposes, or as new uses emerge from human medical applications. Clinicians also are likely to reap the benefits of this knowledge. Because samples often are acquired easily from clinical patients in most practice settings, access to these tools puts all clinicians in the group of discoverers of new, or variations of, infectious diseases and their clinical manifestations.",

At the end of the cycle, the target DNA has been duplicated (e). Each new DNA can then itself be a targeted molecule for the next cycle of amplification. The process is repeated for 25\u201340 cycles, and then products are visualized following gel electrophoresis (f).
