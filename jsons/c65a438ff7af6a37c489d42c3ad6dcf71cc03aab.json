We first compared RNA from the two positive patient samples extracted with 163 the Norgen, BGI or Invitrogen Purelink methods, as well as RNA isolated from one negative patient 164 sample using the BGI extraction method. These assays confirmed that Norgen/BGI extraction 165 methods are more efficient than Purelink, but also revealed greater sensitivity (~1-3 Ct values) with 166 BGI vs Norgen primers/RT-qPCR mix, particularly with the lowest level sample (L028-Purelink) 167 ( Fig. 2A) .

Treatment with heat, lysis buffers or detergents did not appreciably increase sensitivity further, 237 and in some cases reduced sensitivity (higher Ct values). For the BGI detection system, none of the 238 treatments dramatically improved detection, with the exception of sample L021 (Fig. 4C ), which 239 previously showed the largest difference between extracted RNA and direct UTM analysis (Fig. 240 4A). We presume, therefore, that L021 had higher RNase levels that were not fully inhibited by the 241 (proprietary) RNase inhibitor already present in the BGI mix. Thus, RNase inhibitor is sufficient to 242 improve direct detection and under these conditions BGI and Norgen kits perform similarly. 243",

Cost analysis of the 253 BGI and Norgen Biotek RNA isolation systems revealed that the latter is ~40% more expensive 254 than that of BGI ($6.55 CAD vs. $4.68 CAD/sample, Fig. 4D ), but we found that for small batches 255 of samples the bead-based BGI kit was slower, increasing sample preparation time by about 50% 256 over the Norgen kit (~30 vs. 45 min).

The BGI system also performed slightly better that the SYBR green methods with 268 low-level standards. One drawback to the SYBR green method was reduced specificity, as we 269 sometimes observed non-specific products in negative or low-level samples, although these could 270 be identified by monitoring melt curves. These non-specific products were not routinely observed in 271 NTC reactions. Thus, melt curve analysis is an essential component of SYBR green qPCR. We also 272 tested 8 other published and newly designed primers and all yielded non-specific PCR products (not 273 shown). Whether non-specific products can be eliminated using alternative RT-qPCR mixes 274 remains to be determined. The BGI detection module is over four-times more expensive than 275 Norgen or SYBR green methods (Fig. 4D) , providing a significant financial drawback. Cost savings 276 with the Norgen kit could be even greater if multiplexing primers/probes were utilized; currently 277 this system follows the CDC guidelines with three separate reactions, one each using FAM-labelled 278 viral N1, viral N2 or human RNase P primers/probes. The Norgen and SYBR green systems also 279 provide more flexibility than that of BGI. Primers/probes come pre-mixed in the BGI system and 280 cannot be altered, whereas they are added separately in the others, allowing alternative primer/probe 281 options and concentrations.

This approach reduces cost, 291 increases throughput, and circumvents the need for RNA extraction systems that may be scarce 292 during a pandemic.

We found that SYBR green-based detection was 295 incompatible with direct detection of samples in UTM. The unmodified BGI detection system 296 performed well in the direct detection of unprocessed patient samples, and confirmed all positive 297 samples tested across a wide range of clinical values, but had a reduced median sensitivity of ~12-298 fold compared to extracted RNA. The Norgen system initially performed poorly on direct UTM 299 samples, generating much higher Ct values than extracted RNA (in some cases 1000s of fold 300 higher), and resulted in several false-negatives. Critically, however, adding RNase inhibitor 301 increased sensitivity of direct RT-qPCR with the Norgen system > 100-fold, allowing detection of 302 all previously false-negative samples. This modification did not, in most cases, dramatically 303 increase sensitivity of direct sample analysis with the BGI detection system, suggesting it already 304 contains an RNase inhibitor. Even in that case however, detection of one patient sample was 305 markedly improved, implying higher RNase levels. Thus, addition of RNase inhibitor is a simple 306 and sufficient step to facilitate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 direct from patient samples. 307",
