Once individuals are identified to be positive for COVID-19, they are isolated in hospital until they recover and cease virus shedding. Their close contacts are traced (from 2 days before illness onset) and quarantined in special facilities, including holiday camps and newly constructed housing estates. Because not every infected person will be identified, containment measures only work if social distancing measures or behavioural changes also reduce so-called silent transmission in the community as a whole.",

Infections increased through January until the implementation of a lockdown of Wuhan and other affected cities. Since January, 2020, COVID-19 cases have been reported outside China in increasing numbers, with many countries not taking strong control measures, such as lockdowns, until relatively larger numbers of cases had been reported. In Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan public health measures to prevent community epidemics were quickly implemented and were able to avoid the need for complete lockdowns. We searched PubMed on March 31, 2020, for studies reporting the impact of alternative public health measures against COVID-19 using keywords including \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, \u201cnovel coronavirus-infected pneumonia\u201d, \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d, \u201clockdown\u201d, \u201csocial distancing\u201d, \u201cisolation\u201d, \u201ccontact tracing\u201d, and \u201cquarantine\u201d. We scanned 227 published studies and found six that estimated the impact of public health measures in Wuhan or elsewhere in mainland China, one study that described the early application of testing and contact tracing in Singapore, and one study reporting the impact of quarantine on transmission on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.\nAdded value of this study\nWe estimated the effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in Hong Kong as a measure of transmissibility over time and found that it has remained at approximately 1 for the past 8 weeks. We described the public health measures that have been introduced to contain COVID-19 transmission and the behavioural changes reported by the population, and found that distancing measures and changes in behaviour were associated with rapid declines in influenza activity. The speed of decline in influenza activity in 2020 was quicker than in previous years in which school closures were implemented but there were no other social distancing measures or voluntary changes in behaviour.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe experience in Hong Kong indicates that COVID-19 transmission can be contained with a combination of testing and isolating cases, plus tracing and quarantining their close contacts, along with some degree of social distancing to reduce community transmission from unidentified cases.\n",

We aimed to quantify the effect of containment measures on COVID-19. In addition, to identify whether social distancing and behavioural changes have been associated with reducing silent transmission of COVID-19, we analysed data on influenza activity as a proxy for potential changes in transmission of infection in line with the interventions implemented, assuming a similar mode and efficiency of spread of influenza and COVID-19. The specific objective of this study was to quantify population behavioural changes in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to describe the likely impact of the behavioural changes and public health measures on COVID-19 transmission and influenza transmission in the community.",

The methods and survey instruments used were similar to those used for surveys during the SARS epidemic in 2003,5, 6 the influenza A H1N1 pandemic in 2009,7 and the influenza A H7N9 outbreak in China in 2013.8 Participants were recruited using random-digit dialling of both landline and mobile telephone numbers. Telephone numbers were randomly generated by a computer system. Calls were made during both working and non-working hours by trained interviewers to avoid over-representation of non-working groups. Respondents were required to be at least 18 years old and able to speak Cantonese Chinese or English. New respondents were recruited for each survey round. Within each household, an eligible household member with the nearest birthday was invited to participate in the survey, which was not necessarily the person that initially answered the telephone. Survey items included measures of risk perception, attitudes towards COVID-19, and behaviours taken against contracting COVID-19, including hygiene, face masks, and reduction of social contact. In the second and third surveys, respondents who were parents of school-age children were asked to answer additional questions about social contact patterns of their children because schools were closed at the time of the interviews. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong. All participants gave verbal informed consent.",

We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers from serial intervals and incidence of COVID-19 cases over time,9, 10 assuming a serial interval of 7\u00b75 days.11 We extended the approach used by Thompson and colleagues10 to allow for undetected cases due to censoring and imperfect detection of local cases. We assumed that 99% of imported cases and 80% of local cases would be detected. We developed a data-augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to jointly estimate the time-varying reproduction number, the delay distribution from onset to reporting which can be used to inform censoring and undetected cases. Time-varying estimates of reproduction numbers were made with a 7-day sliding window.",

Using similar surveys, face mask use during the SARS outbreak in 2003 was 79%,5 and it reached a maximum of 10% during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009.7 These changes in behaviour indicate the level of concern among the population about this particular infection, and the extent of voluntary social distancing in addition to the distancing created by school closures. However, we did identify evidence of reductions in voluntary social distancing behaviours in our third survey in March, perhaps indicating some fatigue with these measures.",

First, we could not identify which measure was potentially the most effective and whether border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, social distancing, or behavioural changes are most important in suppressing COVID-19 transmission. It is likely that each plays a part. Unlinked cases have been identified in the community and will continue to be identified, indicating that not every chain of transmission has been identified by contact tracing from known cases. Although we have noted major effects of control measures and behavioural changes on influenza transmission, the effects could be of a different magnitude for COVID-19 because of differences in transmission dynamics. Second, our surveys of population behaviours could have been affected by response bias, because we relied on self-reported data. They also could have been affected by selection bias away from working adults, although this should have been reduced by conducting surveys in non-working as well as working hours\u2014we were unable to assess potential selection bias. Without a baseline survey before Jan 23, 2020, we could not compare changes in behaviours, although the results of similar surveys from previous epidemics can be used for comparison.6, 7, 8, 11 Finally, although we identified reductions in the incidence of influenza virus infections in outpatients and paediatric inpatients, it is possible that these time series were affected by reduced health-care-seeking behaviours and limited health-care access that probably resulted from private clinic closure, which occurred around the period of the Chinese New Year holiday.",

Although the transmission dynamics and modes of transmission of COVID-19 have not been precisely elucidated, they are likely to share at least some characteristics with influenza virus transmission, because both viruses are directly transmissible respiratory pathogens with similar viral shedding dynamics.23 The measures implemented in Hong Kong are less drastic than those used to contain transmission in mainland China, and are probably more feasible in many other locations worldwide. If these measures and population responses can be sustained, avoiding fatigue among the general population, they could meaningfully mitigate the impact of a local epidemic of COVID-19.",
