            "text": "Cytokines are the soluble messengers that immune cells use to communicate, ultimately modulating protective responses against pathogens [1]. Yet, cytokines may also drive the dysregulated immune responses that characterize autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 maintain and aggravate inflammation in RA: they induce activation of leukocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts like synoviocytes, promote differentiation of pathogenic immune cells, and promote synthesis of metalloproteinases that erode the joint [2]. The development over the past decade and a half of agents targeting cytokines or their receptors, denoted \u2018biologics\u2019, represents a landmark advancement in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These agents include monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins that target cytokines or cytokine receptors, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and its receptor, IL-1, and others. However, despite the therapeutic success of biologics, it has become evident that targeting a single cytokine does not completely abrogate the pathology of rheumatologic disease for all patients. In addition, many of these agents lose efficacy over time owing to immunogenicity [3] and the intravenous or subcutaneous administration of these agents is an obstacle for some patients.",

This family of cytokine receptors employs the Janus kinase-signal transduction and activation of transcription (JAK\u2013STAT) pathway to effect signal transduction [7]. Upon binding of a type I/II cytokine to its cognate receptor, receptor-associated JAKs are activated and phosphorylate STATs, transcription factors critical for the activation of cytokine-specific genetic programs. Given the major role played by JAKs and STATs in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity [8, 9], it is perhaps no surprise that small molecules targeted against JAKs, or Jakinibs, represent an emerging treatment for autoimmune and inflammatory disease. In this review, we have described the JAK\u2013STAT pathway and its role in human diseases, and then we have discussed the efficacy and safety of individual Jakinibs in different diseases. Electronic databases of EMBASE, PubMed, and SCOPUS were searched to identify all reports published in the English language that described \u2018Janus kinase\u2019, \u2018JAK/STAT pathway\u2019, \u2018role of JAK/STAT pathway in human diseases\u2019, and \u2018JAK inhibitors\u2019. We also searched relevant conferences for abstracts describing Jakinibs or the JAK\u2013STAT pathway, searched Clinicaltrials.gov for individual Jakinibs, and reviewed press releases from Pfizer, Lilly, Galapagos, Incyte, and Abbvie.",

The basic structure of all JAKs consists of four structural domains composed of seven homologous regions [JH1\u20137] (Fig. 1). JH1 and JH2 denote the kinase and pseudokinase domains: the name Janus is an allusion to the double-faced Roman god of gates and doors owing to the presence of these two kinase domains. JH1 is the active catalytic phosphotransferase domain and the target of the Jakinibs developed so far, which compete with adenosine triphosphate at the catalytic site. Because the JH1 domains of the four JAKs exhibit a high degree of homology not only within the JAKs but also with other TYKs, development of a selective Jakinib has been challenging.\n",

Recent work, however, has demonstrated that in JAK2, the JH2 has low-level catalytic activity [11, 12]. JH3 and JH4 are primarily involved in stabilizing the structural conformation of the enzyme whereas the JH5, JH6, and JH7/Four-point-one protein, Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin domain (FERM) are critical for the association of the JAKs with their cognate receptors [13]. Notably, recent mapping of the FERM domains of receptor-bound JAK1 and TYK2 revealed striking differences in the structure that confers binding specificity, which might be exploited for the generation of selective inhibitors [5, 14\u201316].",

            "text": "The STAT transcription factors transmit type I/II cytokine signals downstream of the JAKs. STAT proteins contain an amino terminal, a coiled coil, a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a linker, a Src-homology2 (SH2), and a transcriptional activation domain (TAD) [17] (Fig. 1). Inactive cytoplasmic STATs exist primarily as monomers or preformed dimers [18]; upon activation, STAT dimers form a nutcracker-like structure. The highly conserved SH2 domain forms the hinge of this structure and is the target of most patented STAT inhibitors [19]. The linker region and DBD surround the centrally located chromatin like the jaws of the nutcracker, whereas the TAD is located at the C terminus and undergoes serine phosphorylation to recruit additional transcriptional activators and enhance transcriptional activity. These areas display the lowest sequence conservation [20]. Given the involvement of STATs in signaling events downstream of cytokine receptors as well as growth factors, STATs have long been considered as potential therapeutic targets for cancer and autoimmune disease [19]. Therefore, low-sequence conservation areas could represent a target for inhibitors, such as DNA-binding decoy oligonucleotides, with increased selectivity [21].",

The canonical signaling cascade is initiated when type I/II cytokines bind to their cognate receptors (Fig. 2). Type I/II receptors are composed of distinct chains, which oligomerize upon binding of the cytokine. Oligomerization causes separation of the intracellular subunits of the cytokine receptor, which moves the receptor-associated JAKs apart from each other, relieving constitutive inhibition and resulting in their activation [1, 7, 23, 24]. The JAKs phosphorylate themselves and the intracellular portion of the receptors, which serve as docking sites for STAT transcription factors [25], which, in turn, are also phosphorylated. When phosphorylated by JAKs, inactive cytosolic STAT monomers undergo a conformational change that allows for the formation of active homodimers, heterodimers, or tetramers. The active STATs can then translocate into the nucleus where they act as transcription factors to regulate gene expression [1, 26, 27].\n",

Each receptor is composed of multiple subunits, and each subunit associates with a JAK (Fig. 3). Some receptor chains associate selectively with a specific JAK, whereas some are less selective. Thus, the extent to which a particular type I/II cytokine depends on a specific JAK to transduce signals is determined by the subunits of that cytokine\u2019s receptor (Tables 1, 2). For example, the common \u03b3-chain (\u03b3c), used by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, associates exclusively with JAK3 and is the only receptor subunit that uses JAK3 [28]. Other receptor chains are able to associate with more than one JAK isoform: for instance, the gp130 subunit can use JAK1, JAK2, and possibly TYK2 [16]. A further layer of specificity is conferred by the pairing of specific receptor chains with each other: thus, the \u03b3c pairs exclusively with JAK1-associated receptor subunits. Most type I/II cytokine receptors signal through multiple JAKs as a result of this pairing of distinct JAK-associated subunits. JAK2-associated growth factor and hormone-like cytokine receptors are the exception and their subunits have the unique property of self-pairing [5].\n\n\n",

As mentioned above, upon activation of JAK-associated cytokine receptors, cytosolic STATs undergo tyrosine phosphorylation and dimerize. However, it is important to recognize a number of additional non-canonical roles for STATs. For example, STATs act not only as homodimers or heterodimers, but also as tetramers [29]. STATs can be phosphorylated by kinases other than JAKs, including Flt3R and pyruvate kinase [29]. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, STATs undergo serine phosphorylation in response to various external stimuli, which can augment transcriptional responses [30]. Serine phosphorylation also appears to be important for the ability of certain STATs to promote oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria [29]. Finally, non-phosphorylated STATs are capable of dimerizing and acting as transcriptional regulators [31, 32]. STATs do not physically associate with a specific cytokine receptor but can be phosphorylated on specific tyrosine and serine residues. This results in a certain degree of functional overlap between STATs. Each member of the STAT family can be activated by multiple cytokines and their associated JAKs [33], and, in certain situations, one STAT protein can transmit signals that would normally be transduced by a different STAT.",

LOF mutations in JAK3 cause autosomal recessive severe combined immunodeficiency, which recapitulates the phenotype observed in patients with mutations in the \u03b3c subunit [41, 43]. T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell maturation are profoundly impaired given the importance of \u03b3c cytokines such as IL-7 and IL-15 in their development and B-cell functions are also affected. Patients present with severe recurrent infection, failure to thrive, atopic dermatitis, and chronic diarrhea. At this time, the only definitive treatment for this disease is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Because JAK3 is highly expressed in immune cells, patients with autosomal recessive severe combined immunodeficiency are spared from extra-immune disease manifestations. This observation formed the basis for interest in JAK3 blockade as a potential immunosuppressive therapy [5] with limited off-target effects.",

However, signaling downstream of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 is unaffected because the mutation is autosomal recessive for type I IFN signaling. Therefore, heterozygous patients are not susceptible to viral infection. Complete biallelic STAT1 deficiency, by contrast, is purely autosomal recessive for type I and II IFN signaling. Affected patients therefore exhibit fatal susceptibility to viral disease in addition to mycobacterial infections [45]. GOF STAT1 mutations cause chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis because increased signaling downstream of IFN\u03b3 inhibits IL-17 production, ultimately causing defective responses to fungal infection. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis patients are also predisposed to autoimmunity, and GOF STAT1 mutations have been reported to cause a number of other autoimmune manifestations [46].",

IL-17 is critical for immune responses to extracellular bacteria and fungi, and IL-22 promotes barrier integrity [51, 52]. Dominant-negative STAT3 mutations cause hyper immunoglobulin E syndrome, also known as Job\u2019s syndrome, which is characterized by recurrent sinopulmonary infections, mucocutaneous candidiasis, dermatitis, elevated serum immunoglobulin E levels, and connective tissue abnormalities [53]. Activating mutations in STAT3, by contrast, cause early-onset autoimmune disease [54] with neonatal diabetes and autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease [55]. This phenotype is driven by increased STAT3 transcriptional activity, concomitant defective STAT1/5 phosphorylation, and reduced differentiation of regulatory T cells, which are important for immune tolerance [55]. Somatic STAT3 mutations are also associated with a broad range of hematologic and solid organ malignancies, which make STAT3 blockade an active area of research for therapeutic agents [56, 57].",

In vitro CYP3A4 inhibition with ketoconazole resulted in over 70% inhibition of metabolism [70], which supports in vivo data estimating a 103% increase in the tofacitinib area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) following ketoconazole administration [71]. Drug interaction studies with fluconazole also showed significant increases in the maximum plasma concentration (C\nmax) and AUC of tofacitinib, resulting in dosing adjustment recommendations in the package insert for concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and strong inhibitors of CYP2C19 [72, 73]. Interaction studies with rifampin, a CYP3A4 inducer, yielded lower C\nmax and AUC values for tofacitinib; however, the pharmacodynamic and clinical significance of these changes are unknown [74]. Tofacitinib is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4 itself, as evidenced in a lack of alteration of midazolam pharmacokinetics, a CYP3A4 substrate, when co-administered with tofacitinib [75].",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes were reported as Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials RA MRI score (RAMRIS), quantitative RAMRIS, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI [90]. The study showed significant improvement in RAMRIS bone marrow edema at 6 months and improvement in synovitis scoring at 3 months in both tofacitinib monotherapy and tofacitinib with methotrexate combination therapy compared with methotrexate monotherapy. A significant difference was noted in synovitis scores by quantitative RAMRIS at 3 months. Erosive damage was significantly lower at 6 and 12 months in both the tofacitinib monotherapy and combination therapy groups compared with methotrexate monotherapy [91]. The phase III ORAL-Scan trial also used radiographic outcomes and showed slower rates of radiographic progression of disease in patients treated with tofacitinib at 5 or 10 mg BID with background methotrexate as measured by erosion score and joint space narrowing scores. The change in the joint space narrowing score was statistically significant at 12 months [88].",

It was concluded from this result that the effective dose of tofacitinib in psoriasis would be 10 mg BID. Owing to potential safety concerns regarding the use of higher doses of tofacitinib, the drug failed to obtain FDA approval for the treatment of psoriasis.

Although a full understanding of IBD immunopathogenesis is lacking, it appears that both forms result from dysregulated immune responses. The role of type I/II cytokines in IBD is well established: IL-12, type II IFN, and IL-6 promote the function of pathogenic innate lymphoid cells and T cells [104]. However, patients are also immunodeficient: they are unable to constrain pathogenic microbiota. Moreover, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-22 and IL-17A may have a protective role [104].

Ruxolitinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent, CYP2C19 (Table 3). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies using ketoconazole and erythromycin, strong and intermediate inhibitors of CYP3A4 as well as rifampin, a CYP3A4 inducer, were conducted to determine the impact on the metabolism of ruxolitinib [117]. Co-administration of ketoconazole with single-dose ruxolitinib resulted in an increase in drug exposure for ruxolitinib of 91% and a prolongation of the elimination half-life of ruxolitinib of approximately 2 h. Co-administration of erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, with ruxolitinib exhibited much less significant impact on C\nmax and drug exposure of ruxolitinib. Pharmacokinetic studies of ruxolitinib with rifampin resulted in a 52% decrease in C\nmax of ruxolitinib with a decrease in terminal half-life of approximately 50% [117]. The pharmacodynamic impact of these interactions were assessed through an assay evaluating the extent of inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. Co-administration of ketoconazole resulted in a doubling of STAT3 phosphorylation inhibition, which was clinically and statistically significant. Co-administration of erythromycin and rifampin resulted in a 13% increase or a 10% decrease of pharmacodynamic activity respectively. These changes were not considered to be clinically significant [117]. Further pharmacokinetic modeling studies evaluated the effect of fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, and estimated a two-fold increase in ruxolitinib AUC with fluconazole doses of the 100\u2013200 mg total daily dose. This same modeling study also evaluated the impact of ruxolitinib on p-glycoprotein efflux pumps and did not predict a significant impact of ruxolitinib co-administration with p-glycoprotein substrates including digoxin [118].",

An interesting finding in this study was the rapid improvement in ACR criteria within a week whereas, inability to respond to the drug within 4 weeks was predictive of future failure.

Common side effects in RA clinical trials included infections such as nasopharyngitis or upper respiratory infections, bronchitis, and gastroenteritis. A number of opportunistic infections such as herpes zoster, tuberculosis, cellulitis, panniculitis, septic shock, and osteomyelitis were also reported [3, 142]. The observed risk was similar to that with other DMARDS, and a retrospective meta-analysis of pooled data from all the trials and extension studies indicated a lower risk of infection in tofacitinib-treated patients than for patients treated with biological DMARDs [142]. The exception to this is varicella zoster virus, for which the risk of reactivation is substantially higher in tofacitinib-treated patients [143, 144]. This increased risk may be in part owing to the importance of JAK3-dependent cytokines in driving the development and functions of NK cells, which are important for controlling viral infections such as herpes zoster [142]. However, NK cell counts are not markedly reduced in tofacitinib-treated patients; therefore, the etiology of zoster reactivation may be related to NK cell function or to effects on a different leukocyte population. Among other serious opportunistic infections, BK viremia and nephropathy have been reported in kidney transplant recipients treated with high-dose tofacitinib (30 and 15 mg BID) in combination with mycophenolate mofetil [145]. A larger multi-center clinical trial also showed a higher incidence (14\u201318%) of BK nephropathy in renal transplant recipients treated with tofacitinib compared with cyclosporine (6%) [146], also in combination with mycophenolate mofetil and at relatively high doses. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy has been reported in a 75-year-old man treated with ruxolitinib for myelofibrosis [147].",

However, long-term extension studies have not shown evidence of an increased rate of cardiovascular events [92]. Combined data from phase III trials on tofacitinib demonstrated stabilization of lipid levels after 3 months of treatment and the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events was similar to placebo [150]. The effect of tofacitinib on the lipid profile is similar to tocilizumab and may be secondary to blocking IL-6 signaling. The physiological role of IL-6 on hepatic lipid metabolism is complex and incompletely understood [151]. IL-6 is known to cause insulin resistance and high IL-6 levels have been noted in obesity. IL-6 also support the redistribution of fatty acids from the blood to peripheral tissues, which results in low serum levels of LDL, HDL, and triglycerides [25]. To date, long-term extension studies have not shown an increase in major cardiovascular events in tofacitinib-treated patients relative to those treated with placebo [150, 152]. Tofacitinib was actually shown to reduce vascular stiffness in RA patients in a small study of 18 patients [153]. Assessment of cholesterol and lipoprotein kinetics in RA patients before and after tofacitinib treatment in comparison to healthy volunteers revealed increased levels of cholesterol in RA patients after treatment and is secondary to reduced cholesterol ester catabolism and anti-atherogenic HDL level improvement [154].",

In addition, adverse effects of this drug included elevations in lipid parameters [80, 132, 160]. Notably, several high-potency, commonly used hydroxymethylglutaryl Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins) including simvastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized via CYP3A4 [161]. Therefore, concomitant use with decernotinib could potentially increase the risk for statin-associated toxicity.",

This conclusion was confirmed for CYP3A4 in a study on the impact of filgotinib on midazolam clearance in healthy volunteers, which showed no changes in midazolam metabolism [164]. The potential of filgotinib to impact cell-based transport systems including p-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein were examined in vitro, with the authors concluding that filgotinib was unlikely to inhibit these transport systems. The effects of filgotinib on organic cation transporters including organic cation transporter 2 were also examined in vitro with observed inhibition, but this is of unknown clinical significance. The potential for filgotinib to affect organic anion transporters implicated in methotrexate (MTX) clearance was explored, with no changes in MTX clearance observed in doses of filgotinib up to 300 mg [164]. It appears that the unique pharmacokinetic profile of filgotinib may provide flexibility in dosing regimens (146).",

Challenges to the development of STAT inhibitors include issues with bioavailability and selectivity. For example, considerable homology exists between STAT1 and STAT3. STAT1 facilitates vital functions including cell death, apoptosis, and pathogen defense, thus off-target STAT1 blockade by a STAT3 inhibitor can lead to a host of undesired adverse effects such as increased survival of tumor cells [33, 187, 188]. Another challenge in developing STAT inhibitors is functional redundancy in the action of different STATs. Specifically, although STAT3 is critical for signaling downstream of IL-6, STAT3-deficient cells continue to respond to IL-6 stimulation through activation of STAT1 [189]. Thus, selective blockade of one STAT molecule may not be clinically useful, as another STAT might compensate for the inhibited protein.",

Clinical trials are ongoing with various Jakinibs in several autoimmune conditions ranging from rheumatoid arthritis to psoriasis. Similarly, diseases characterized by serum elevations of JAK-dependent cytokines could respond well to Jakinibs. These include diseases for which a type I IFN signature has been defined such as SLE, myositis, scleroderma, and primary Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, as well as diseases driven by IL-6 such as relapsing polychondritis and large-vessel vasculitis. Several trials are indeed probing the efficacy of Jakinibs in the treatment of diseases characterized by an IFN signature, based on preclinical data [194] and on the observation that baricitinib is effective for the treatment of monogenic interferonopathies such as chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature syndrome and SAVI [stimulator of interferon genes (STING) associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy], which are also associated with a type I IFN signature [138].

            "text": "Optimal dosing strategies of Jakinibs also deserve further study, whereas currently approved regimens rely on a single dose for induction of remission and maintenance, it is not clear that this is the optimal strategy. It is possible that loading patients with high doses to induce remission, followed by a lower maintenance dose, would be a more effective strategy, as is the case for corticosteroids. Investigations of non-oral formulations of Jakinibs are also in the preliminary stages for diseases including psoriasis, allergic dermatitis, and ocular disease. Finally, biomarker development is ongoing to identify groups of patients with disease likely to respond to Jakinibs, as complex rheumatologic diseases may be driven by JAK-dependent cytokines to a different degree in different patients [198]. After the era of biologics, the development of Jakinibs and their successful use in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases heralds an exciting new chapter in rheumatology. These drugs are unique both structurally and functionally, as small molecules that can be administered orally rather than injected, and which simultaneously block multiple cytokines downstream of their receptors. In the coming years, Jakinibs are poised to change the field of autoimmune and rheumatologic diseases as ongoing basic, preclinical, and clinical research will surely determine the feasibility and benefits of selectivity, optimized dosing, formulation, and patient selection to minimize undesirable off-target effects and maximize clinical efficacy.",

JAKs have four functional domains: the kinase, pseudokinase, Four-point-one protein, Ezrin, Radixin and Moesin domain (FERM), and Src Homology 2 (SH2) domains. The kinase domain is the site of catalytic activity and inhibition by JAK inhibitors (Jakinibs). The FERM and pseudokinase domain interact with the kinase domain and primarily have regulatory functions. An alternative nomenclature for the domains based on their amino acid sequence classifies them as seven Janus homology (JH) domains. b Simplified three-dimensional image of JAK. The crystal structure of the FERM and SH2 domain was recently described and may contribute to receptor recognition. JH1 and JH2 are the kinase and pseudokinase domains respectively. c Linear structure of STAT molecule showing different domains. STAT proteins contain an amino terminal, a coiled coil, a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a linker, an SH2, and a transcriptional activation domain. The TAD domain is located at the C terminus and undergoes serine phosphorylation to recruit additional transcriptional activators. d Simplified three-dimensional image of STAT. Activated STAT dimers form a nutcracker-like structure as shown in this figure. The hinge of the nutcracker is formed by highly conserved SH2 domain and is commonly the target of STAT inhibitors.

Binding of various type I/II cytokines to specific receptor subunits leads to activation of specific JAK pathways. For example, \u03b3-common chain (\u03b3c) associates only with JAK3 and mediates signaling of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-15, and IL-21. However, JAK1 has a broader role in cytokine signaling. Newer generation Jakinibs block specific JAK molecules compared with the first-generation Jakinibs that are non-selective. Thereby, the new-generation Jakinibs should have fewer side effects while maintaining similar efficacy as first-generation Jakinibs. However, some degree of off-target side effects such as cytopenias are seen even with selective Jakinibs such as decernotinib and ABT494.
