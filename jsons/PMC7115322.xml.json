            "text": "First, the content of infectious agents expelled by an infected person depends largely on the location within the respiratory tract where the droplets originate. Pathogenic microorganisms tend to be found in certain locations, particularly the tonsils and the larynx, and seldom at the front of the mouth.5 Three droplet size distribution modes have been proposed: the bronchiolar fluid film burst mode, containing droplets produced during normal breathing (d \u2264 1 \u00b5m); the laryngeal mode, most active during voicing and coughing (d \u2265 1 \u00b5m); and the oral cavity mode, active during speech and coughing, producing droplets \u2265100 \u00b5m.6, 7 The oral cavity is among the sources of expiratory droplets, especially larger ones5, 8, 9; the droplet formation mechanism in the oral cavity is shown in Figure 1\n. Large droplets from the trachea produced during coughing might not be released into the environment because they readily deposit within the head airways. Johnson et al6 found that droplets \u226520 \u00b5m only originate from the oral cavity. Droplets generated during breathing may originate from both the upper and lower airways, but the latter seems to make the major contribution because of the film rupture mechanism.12, 13\n",

One is the instability caused by the shear stress on the mucus-air interface that leads to the avalanche of mucus and droplet formation. The biphasic airway lining fluid has an overall thickness ranging from 5-100 \u00b5m. A critical air speed is required to initiate the instability, which varies according to mucus thickness, its viscoelastic properties, and surface tension at the mucus-air interface. Coughing is one mechanism for mucus clearance, during which air speed as high as 200 m/s can be attained14 and interfacial shearing is peaked within the trachea.15 This mechanism has traditionally been considered an exhalation process during coughing and sneezing; however, it was found to be also plausible around the first bifurcations during inhalation.15, 16 Recent studies include the effect of viscoelastic properties and surface tension on the onset of instabilities (eg, Vasudevan and Lange17, 18) and the effect on the size distribution and volume concentration of bioaerosols produced.19\n",

            "text": "During normal tidal breathing, however, the shear force provided by the respiration airflow is not sufficient to induce instabilities. The mechanism for droplet formation during normal breathing relates to the reopening of collapsed terminal airways at the beginning of inspiration. Almstrand et al20 examined the production of exhaled particles after varying degrees of airway closure. Concentrations of exhaled particles showed a 2- to 18-fold increase after exhalations to residual volume, compared with exhalations where no airway closure was shown. Malashenko et al21 defined a critical capillary number (Ca = \u00b5U/\u03c3, where \u00b5 is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid, U is the axial speed of the air-liquid meniscus propagation, and \u03c3 is the surface tension between the lining fluid and the air) above which droplets may be formed during normal breathing. In addition, experiments simulating the film droplet formation process showed that small fluid films generate droplets as efficiently as large films, and droplets may well be generated from films with diameters <1 mm (ie, the diameter of terminal bronchioles).22\n",

The size of viruses varies from 0.02-0.3 \u00b5m, and the size of bacteria varies from 0.5-10 \u00b5m in their naked form. It is anticipated that small viral pathogens travel readily within the lungs and between individuals and their environment in small droplet nuclei. The influenza virus RNA detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in human exhaled breath suggests that it may be contained in fine particles generated during tidal breathing.32, 33 Lindsley et al34 measured the content of influenza virus in aerosol particles from human coughs. Thirty-five percent of the influenza RNA detected were contained in particles >4 \u00b5m in aerodynamic diameter, whereas 23% were contained in particles 1-4 \u00b5m and 42% were in particles <1 \u00b5m, suggesting that much of the viral RNA is contained within particles in the respirable size range. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, has been reported in small droplet nuclei, and patients have generated bacteria-laden aerosols in a diameter range of 0.65-4.7 \u00b5m during coughing.35\n",

Exhaled flow rate over time may be represented as a sinusoidal function for breathing, a constant for talking, and a combination of gamma probability distribution functions for coughing.36, 37 The peak velocities of coughing and breathing can be 6-22 m/s (>10 m/s on average) and 1-5 m/s, respectively.30, 36, 38 The differences in reported initial velocities are mainly attributed to different measurement techniques and individual variability.",

The transient process from a droplet to a droplet nucleus can be ignored when studying the movement of small droplets,44 whereas evaporation barely affects large droplets because they deposit soon after release. However, medium-sized droplets (eg, 50 \u00b5m in diameter) are most sensitive to humidity.43 Deposition occurs either by gravitational sedimentation, turbulent eddy impaction, or diffusional deposition. Large droplets were first defined as droplets >100 \u00b5m by Wells.45 In respiratory exhalation flows, the largest droplets that would completely evaporate before traveling 2 m are between 60 and 100 \u00b5m.42 These large droplets are carried >6 m by exhaled air at a velocity of 50 m/s (sneezing), >2 m at a velocity of 10 m/s (coughing), and <1 m at a velocity of 1 m/s (breathing). Particles of diameters 1-3 \u00b5m remained suspended almost indefinitely, whereas those with a diameter of 10 \u00b5m took 17 minutes to fall 3 m to the floor, those with a diameter of 20 \u00b5m took 4 minutes, and those with a diameter of 100 \u00b5m took 10 seconds.46 For small droplets, gravitational sedimentation is negligible; however, turbulent eddy impact or diffusional deposition may occur. Small droplets are subject to the ambient velocity field, and their evaporation clearly assists in transporting them a significant distance.47\n",

Wake-induced transport of material in the direction of the walking motion continues because of inertial effects, even after the person stops. When the walking effect is combined with hinged door opening, the latter is the dominant transport mechanism, and human-induced wake motion enhances compartment-to-compartment transport. In addition, when isolation room air has a temperature different from that of the corridor, the 2-way airflow effect at the openings plays an important role in aerosol dispersal.62\n",

Inhaled particles can deposit in different regions of the respiratory tract (eg, head airway region, tracheobronchial region, pulmonary region). Deposition mechanisms include inertial impaction (limited to large particles), settling (most important in small airways), Brownian motion of submicrometer particles, and interception.70 Recent studies on airflow and particle transport in the human respiratory tract were reviewed by Kleinstreuer and Zhang.71 Airflows are complex in the nasal cavities and oral airways; particles deposit largely at stagnation points, disrupting axial particle motion.

Brankston et al74 concluded in a review that natural influenza virus transmission in humans generally occurs over short distances, rather than over long distances, whereas Tellier75, 76 concluded that aerosol transmission occurs at appreciable rates. Weber and Stilianakis77 found that contact, large droplet, and small droplet (aerosol) transmission are all potentially important modes of transmission for influenza virus.

The latter approach is preferred because the droplets generated would be smaller and more dangerous if full suppression was not achieved. Edwards et al26 found that delivering approximately 1 g of isotonic saline orally via nebulized aerosols (droplets 5.6 \u00b5m in diameter) reduced the total amount of expired aerosols (among super-producing individuals) by approximately 72% over a 6-hour period. In vitro tests using a simulated cough machine indicated that a mucus mimetic nebulized with saline produces a larger droplet size after the forced convection of air over its surface than when air is forced over the mucus mimetic alone (ie, without saline nebulization). In a subsequent study, Clark et al78 report that delivering isotonic saline aerosols (5.6-\u00b5m droplets) into the endotracheal tube of anesthetized bull calves showed a dose-responsive effect on exhaled bioaerosols; 6 minutes of treatment resulted in a decrease of up to 50% of exhaled aerosols for at least 120 minutes, compared with the pretreatment case. Inhaling safe surface-active materials, such as isotonic saline, to suppress exhaled bioaerosols was reviewed and recommended for controlling airborne transmission79; however, more studies are required to clearly elucidate the potential of this new approach.",

They suggested that surgical masks may reduce infectiousness, rather than protect against infection, especially when airborne transmission is important. Influenza viruses (with sizes in the 80- to 120-nm range) and other viruses of similar size are capable of penetrating the mask in either direction. The N95 respirators are efficient in removing very fine droplet nuclei, but face masks are not. However, face masks, if worn by an infected person, can suppress the expired jets (Fig 2A) and reduce the close contact transmission via both the droplet-borne and short-range airborne routes.",

However, in the case of the isolation room, the stable thermal stratification zone may cause the lock-up phenomenon to occur86 if the exhaled pollutant is not caught by the thermal plume penetrating into the upper zone, resulting in a longer residence time of pollutants.87 Displacement ventilation can create what might be referred to as inversion clouds in rooms.
