However, these techniques have so far been limited for a number of different reasons. (a) Proteins in foods are mostly denatured because of the physical, chemical and enzymic transformations undergone during food processing; thus, epitopes found on native molecules are often modified or destroyed. (b) Depending upon the type of immunoassay used, different conclusions can be drawn when a given antigen is present (Breton et a1 1988a (Breton et a1 , 1989 ; native ovalbumin is fully precipitated by polyclonal antibodies whereas the latter will not bind NOA-coated plates.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 112, "end": 133, "text": "(Griffiths et a1 1981", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 134, "end": 157, "text": "(Griffiths et a1 , 1984", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 158, "end": 181, "text": "Skerrit and Smith 1985;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 182, "end": 201, "text": "Breton et a1 1988a)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 619, "end": 638, "text": "(Breton et a1 1988a", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 639, "end": 659, "text": "(Breton et a1 , 1989", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "[NTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "It is becoming important to study epitopes transformed during food processing to identify and quantify components, and also additives, and thus provide for improved quality control. The utilisation of proteins in food is largely determined by their functional properties such as emulsifying, stabilising, foaming and gelforming properties. Egg albumin is one of the most important proteins in food products. As reported by Shimada and Matsushita (1980) , heat coagulation of ovalbumin results from the formation of disulphide links and the exposure of hydrophobic groups. Ovalbumin is a good model for such studies because the presence of disulphide bridges limits the extent of denaturation. This might explain why common epitopes were found in this work to both the native (NOA) and the heat denatured (HDOA) molecules (Breton et a1 1989) . Similarly, human antiovalbumin IgE antibodies were found to bind both the native and the denatured forms of ovalbumin after digestion (Elsayed et a1 1986) . Kilshaw et a1 (1986), by using monoclonal antibodies of the IgGl subclass, concluded that important differences characterised epitopes of NOA compared with those of HDOA; however, only four monoclonals were used to reach this conclusion. Some thermal treatments, including extrusion cooking, are likely to modify completely epitopes found on the native molecule. It is thus necessary to investigate specific epitopes for the denatured form of the molecule. It was shown, for instance, that glycosylation of ovalbumin through the Maillard reaction takes place by heat treatment at low temperature, leading to a loss of immunogenic properties (Kato et a1 1985) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 423, "end": 452, "text": "Shimada and Matsushita (1980)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 821, "end": 840, "text": "(Breton et a1 1989)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 977, "end": 997, "text": "(Elsayed et a1 1986)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1658, "text": "(Kato et a1 1985)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "[NTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "It is also important to evaluate the accuracy of different immunochemical methods to quantify NOA and HDOA, in order to control or to identify ovalbumin in heat-processed foods containing egg.

After removal of immunoprecipitates by high speed centrifugation, supernates were shown by direct ELISA to contain mainly antibodies directed against HDOA. This is shown by the slope obtained against NOA as compared with that of HDOA (Fig 2b) on HDOA-sensitised plates. (NOAsensitised plates were not suitable for analysis, since fixed NOA underwent drastic conformational change as reported by Breton et al(1989) .) Whereas the addition of 40 pg of HDOA was enough to inhibit 85 % of the ELISA response, the addition of 200 pg of NOA inhibited only 35 %. When those supernates were studied by HPLC (Fig 3) , at low dose (20 pg m1-I) of either NOA (Fig 3a) or HDOA (Fig 3c) as antigen, a large peak of free antibody was seen (20.1) in both cases.

In this presentation it has been shown that antibodies with different specificities Identification of heat-treated ovalbumin in canned mushrooms based on optical densities from ELISA procedure using mouse anti-HDOA antiserum (1 :1000) as revealing antibody present in an anti-serum can be separated by affinity chromatography. However, the final specificity will be dependent upon the technique used. Several reports have shown that ovalbumin in heated food can be detected (Janssen et a1 1987) and quantified (Breton et a1 1988b) by immunochemical methods, but until now no experiment has been reported where an immunochemical test could be used to determine whether the product has been heated in the range 'native or heated to below 65\u00b0C' or 'heated at 85 to 100\u00b0C'. We have designed a method by which several polyclonal antibodies could be used by immunising rabbits and mice with either native or heat-denatured ovalbumin and by selecting specific polyclonal antibodies by affinity chromatography on either NOA or HDOA columns. NOA is a monomer of MW 43 kDa and HDOA is a polymer or aggregates of 17 000-18 000 kDa as judged by HPLC (Breton et al 1989) . Such an observation has been made previously showing that heatdenatured OA aggregates exhibited an MW of 2700kDa at 78\u00b0C; 6000kDa at 80\u00b0C and 9700kDa at 82\u00b0C (Kato and Takagi 1987) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 632, "end": 652, "text": "(Janssen et a1 1987)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 668, "end": 688, "text": "(Breton et a1 1988b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1296, "end": 1315, "text": "(Breton et al 1989)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1498, "text": "(Kato and Takagi 1987)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "These antigens induced different antibody subpopulations: as judged by affinity chromatography, anti-NOA antisera contained 87 % anti-NOA specific antibodies, 7 % anti-DOA specific antibodies and 8 % antibodies binding both NOA and DOA. Anti-DOA antisera contained only 22 % antibodies specific for DOA, 28 % specific for NOA and 50% binding both NOA and DOA. However, by direct ELISA, the eight different antibody subpopulations behaved quite differently: as shown previously (Breton et a1 1989) , when fixed to plastic plates, NOA was extremely denatured by interaction with the plastic, and most antibodies (Table 2 ) reacted with NOA on plates, even those supposed to be specific for HDOA (such as DAC,) with the exception of NAC, (specific for NOA) and DAC, (specific for HDOA); most antibodies reacted even better against HDOA. Thus it can be concluded that direct ELISA should not be used to detect changes in antigenic properties of proteins which occurred during food processing. Indeed, on the one hand, though still of general use, direct ELISA fails to detect monoclonal antibodies, leaving these to be identified by other immunochemical tests (Friguet et a1 1984) . The present observation with polyclonal antibodies emphasises the high percentage (85 %) of antibodies which would not be detected by direct ELISA (Table 1) . Moreover, none of the anti-HDOA antibodies was truly specific (ie recognising only HDOA) ( Table  2) . On the other hand, immunoprecipitation is not likely to be of use in the agrofood industries. As we have seen, whereas NAC, was specific for NOA (Breton et a1 1989) , DAC,, NAC, and DAC, were unable to precipitate NOA and were mainly directed against HDOA though not fully specific for it (Figs 2 and 4) . These results were confirmed by HPLC analysis of supernates after immunoprecipitation (Figs 3 and 5). Thus sandwich ELISA can be considered as the best technique for unambiguous identification of either NOA or HDOA, as shown by immunocapture of radioactive ovalbumin followed by sandwich ELISA (Table 3) . This observation was further supported by several previous reports. For instance, by comparing seven different procedures, A1 Moudallal (1984) showed that the apparent binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies depended upon the kind of ELISA test used. Direct ELISA with antigencoated plates was the least powerful technique, but several different sandwich ELISA tests were found to be much better for specificity and sensitivity for the identification of tobacco mosaic virus. It was also shown that the specific binding of monoclonal antibodies to the native form of rat brain hexokinase was possible if the enzyme had been immobilised by polyclonal antibodies (Smith and Wilson 1986). Conversely immunocapture of a coronavirus by monoclonal antibodies increased the sensitivity of an ELISA assay (Bernard et al 1986) . In the case of ovalbumin the molecules underwent an extensive conformational change due to the adsorption of the protein on to polyvinylchloride microtitre plates, as tested with monoclonal (Kilshaw et a1 1986) or polyclonal (Breton et a1 1989) antibodies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 477, "end": 496, "text": "(Breton et a1 1989)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1176, "text": "(Friguet et a1 1984)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1586, "end": 1605, "text": "(Breton et a1 1989)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2195, "text": "Moudallal (1984)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2855, "end": 2875, "text": "(Bernard et al 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 3103, "end": 3122, "text": "(Breton et a1 1989)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 610, "end": 618, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1326, "end": 1335, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1438, "text": "Table  2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1744, "text": "(Figs 2 and 4)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2041, "end": 2050, "text": "(Table 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "When used as capture antibodies, NAC, was not fully specific for NOA by immunocapture (Table 3) , however, when a mouse anti-HDOA antiserum was used in a sandwich ELISA, NAC, was specific for NOA (OD = 0.4) as compared to HDOA (OD = 0), NAC, could also be used.

The technique itself should be based on the assumption that, for a given protein, different conformations might be representative of different heat treatments, provided the duration of heat treatment is long enough to obtain a stabilised form of the molecule.
