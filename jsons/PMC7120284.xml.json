Studies in Canada and elsewhere highlight the potential impact of climate change on food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne diseases, for which environment and climate are important determinants of risk. These determinants vary from increased temperature resulting in increased survival of pathogens through changes in the ecology and geographic range of disease reservoir and vector species. Adaptation to increased risks requires modification of existing approaches to protecting the population from familiar diseases and identification of new or emerging pathogens. Adaptation approaches will likely entail both dedicated interventions such as water treatment and vector control, and changes in human behavior to reduce risk of exposure.",

There is considerable knowledge of drivers of endemic diseases and this knowledge may be sufficient to allow adaptation to changing degrees of risk. The relation between ecosystems, infectious diseases, and global climate change are less intuitive in developed countries where water treatment, vector control, and higher quality housing partly mitigate infectious disease threats (Greer et al. 2008). However, to be sure, we need further analyses on the complex interactions of climate (and extreme weather events) on microbial or vector replication and survival, the natural environment, and on the human\u2013environmental interaction, which includes human population growth and movement, habitat disruption, and modification.",

The latter are transmitted by a variety of arthropod species: West Nile virus is transmitted from birds to humans by mosquitoes, Lyme disease is transmitted from rodents to humans by ticks, and Bartonellosis is transmitted from rodents by fleas.",

Thus, we have limited ability to determine climate effects on vector-borne disease occurrence and to predict and identify any climate change effects. It would be expected, however, that estimation of climatic influences and prediction of climate change effects on vector-borne zoonoses would be more robust than for diseases maintained in a human\u2013vector\u2013human transmission cycle, as the former are relatively independent of the occurrence of human cases.",

We have started addressing the impact of climate change on food-borne and water-borne diseases in Canada by linking precipitation and temperature to enteric diseases and water-borne disease outbreaks (Charron et al. 2004; Fleury et al. 2006; Thomas et al. 2006). However, transmission routes include person to person, water, food, and the environment. Understanding these dynamics is difficult because investigation of the source of individual cases is not routine (Mead et al. 1999) and enteric symptoms may relate to non-enteric causes (Powell et al. 2007). Systems to ensure food safety, from the farm, through processing, to retail and consumption are established in Canada. Since the Walkerton outbreak, where excess rainfall resulted in contamination of the water supply, there have been advances in water safety regulation and water quality monitoring in Canada (Auld et al. 2004).",

Surveillance programs in Canada are comprehensive for common food-borne and water-borne diseases and some vector-borne zoonoses. They include: direct reporting of laboratory confirmed infections at the local and provincial levels; national, provincial, and territorial reporting of notifiable diseases and selected laboratory identifications of enteric pathogens; as well as provision of laboratory reference services both provincially and nationally. In some cases, nontraditional indicators of health and innovative approaches may be used in disease detection programs. For example, pharmacy data on over-the-counter sales, emergency room visits, and Telehealth calls can provide early warning for local disease events (Edge et al. 2004; Edge et al. 2006). \u201cEnvironmental\u201d surveillance to detect infection in sentinel animals or vectors and forecasting (Teklehaimanot et al. 2004; Bouden et al. 2008) to detect disease risks before they occur in humans will be crucial to minimizing risks from emerging zoonoses. Canada has relatively comprehensive programs for monitoring trends in food-borne and water-borne diseases and some vector-borne zoonoses. However, as in other developed countries, many diseases are underreported and national statistics represent trends in disease patterns rather than incidence or prevalence of disease (Flint et al. 2005; Majowicz et al. 2005). While current surveillance approaches in Canada successfully report trends for common diseases, these programs may be less effective for monitoring rarer events, new diseases, and diseases not captured in national statistics.",

The range of diseases that climate change may affect suggests that these issues must be addressed thorough planning of data information systems and by identifying the needs and information required for timely data sharing. Timely analysis of surveillance data to identify where and when disease risks are occurring and presentation of these analyses in a way meaningful for public health professionals are essential to effective disease control.

Changes in public health risks resulting from climate change will therefore impact multiple levels in Canada\u2019s political infrastructure. However, climate impacts will vary across the country and some effects may be relatively local. For these reasons, the municipality is likely to play a major role in adaptation alongside provincial or territorial and national authorities (Ebi and Semenza 2008). This implies that local health authorities recognize the issue and make adaptation to changing disease risks a priority. At the provincial and municipal levels, these responsibilities can be addressed by multiple sectors such as agriculture, health, sustainable development, and natural resources. At the national level, the organizations likely to play a major role in adaptation include federal departments and agencies with responsibilities for agriculture and food, environment, and public health. The Canadian response to West Nile virus offers an interesting model in which initial federal government leadership to address the incursion of this new infectious disease in North America has devolved to provincial and municipal decision-making surveillance, and prevention and control activities. This approach permits local needs and concerns to be addressed, including the acceptability of some measures (see Box 11.3).",

Government response will inevitably promote a horizontal approach incorporating issues of trade, travel, and animal health in assessing human health and economic risks. Not all choices will be financially costly but may require individual lifestyle changes, such as regular use of insect repellent or education of doctors to include emerging diseases such as Lyme disease in their differential diagnoses. Other strategies would be more expensive with benefits realized over decades, as in the case of safe drinking water infrastructure investment.
