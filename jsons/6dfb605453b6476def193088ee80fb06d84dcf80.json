Increase in intracellular concentration of iron ions can be a result of degradation of Fe containing proteins, in particular, aconitate hydratase (AH) (aconitase, EC 4.2.1.3) [2 4 ]. The content of Fe and, consequently, Fe 2+ involved in the Fenton reaction can be reduced by an increase in the con tent of citrate. Therefore, study of features of the func tioning of enzymes responsible for citrate accumulation, first of all AH, is of particular interest. The available data demonstrate a close association of the intensity of oxida tive metabolism with ROS formation. It is known that the functioning of mitochondria under high NADH/NAD + and ATP/ADP ratios and high membrane potential can lead to generation of ROS [5] . The blocking of the tricar boxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) at the level of aconitase under these conditions is supposed to promote a decrease in the degree of reduction of electron carriers in the res piratory chain of mitochondria [3, 6, 7] ; thus, the reac tion catalyzed by mAH (mitochondrial aconitase isoen zyme) might be a locus of regulation of ROS formation.",

Aconitase participates in regulation of the level of endogenous Fe 2+ due to the pres ence in the active center of an iron-sulfur cluster involv ing three cysteine residues. This cluster has a cubic struc ture and consists of four Fe and four S atoms located at the corners of a tetrahedron. Iron as a component of the [4Fe-4S] cluster of AH is in the high spin state. In reduced cluster, there seems to be no complete delocaliza tion of the charge, and one Fe atom differs from other three. This Fe atom is isomorphically included into the structure of the [4Fe-4S] cluster and is easily removed under aerobic conditions with the formation of a [3Fe-4S] + cluster. The enzyme with the [3Fe-4S] center is inactive. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spec troscopy showed that disruption of the [4Fe-4S] 2+ cluster of mAH by superoxide results in the production of Fe 2+ and hydrogen peroxide, forming a hydroxyl radical in the Fenton reaction. Formation of hydroxyl radical but with lower efficiency was also observed on treatment of mAH with hydrogen peroxide. The available data demonstrate that inactivation of mAH by superoxide is reversible [4] . At the same time, initiation of the Fenton reaction can initiate reactive oxygen species induced reactive oxygen species release (RIRR) when the mitochondrial perme ability transition occurs. The phenomenon of RIRR has been demonstrated in isolated cardiomyocytes of rats [68] .",

In addition to the intracellular level of iron, there is still another group of factors that contribute to the trans fer of cAH to IRP1. These are NO [12] , oxidative stress [13] , phosphorylation [77] , and hypoxy/reoxygenation [67] . These effects modulate IRP1 activity on the post translational level. The same factors can change the affin ity of IRP1 to IRE. The factors controlling cAH expres sion are less studied. It is known that, for example, when the iron pool in the serum of guinea pigs became two times less as compared with the norm, the expression of mRNA of IRP1 decreased by 50% with concurrent equal reduction in cAH activity in the liver [78] .

However, only IRP2 is sensitive to the level of iron under physiological oxygen concentrations and can compensate for IRP1 deficit by increasing its RNA binding activity [80] . Thus, IRP2 dominates in the regulation of iron metabolism in mam mals. It seems that IRP1 is also less important for iron metabolism maintenance in mammals under oxidative stress, because mice lacking Cu,Zn SOD show not only inhibition of AH activity, but also decrease in the IRP1 level. In other respects, these mice had a phenotype with normal iron metabolism [81] . Data on the expression and RNA binding activity of IRP1 and IRP2 in animals with inherited hemochromatosis and iron deficiency confirm the leading role of IRP2 in regulation of iron homeostasis in cells [82] . Finally, introduction of doxorubicin, with cardiotoxicity mediated by the increase in free iron level in cardiomyocytes, affects the activity of only IRP2 but not IRP1 [83] .

The basis of an additional mecha nism controlling IRP1 activity at the level of its stability can be phosphorylation of Ser138 [87] . Ser138, Ser711, and flanking sequences are highly conserved. IRP2 is more often phosphorylated than IRP1 [88] . BIOCHEMISTRY Hypoxia decreases the RNA binding activity of IRP1 in glial cells and intensifies it in cortical neurons, and these effects are reversible on reoxygenation [89] . Some ROS are known to modulate IRP1 in the opposite direction: extracellular H 2 O 2 strongly induces IRP1 through a signal cascade, while superoxide (in the place of its formation) inactivates the mRNA binding activity through direct chemical attack [90] . This mechanism is supposed to underlie the development of anemia in chronic diseases and accumulation of iron in cells under inflammation [91] .",

The mechanism of degradation includes oxidation of cysteine residues, while antioxidants (N acetylcysteine, ascorbate, \u03b1 tocopherol) do not stabilize IRP2 but even promote its degradation. Degradation of IRP2 can be triggered by heme mediated oxidation due to the presence of a heme regulatory motif (HRM) in the IRP2 molecule. Two amino acid residues in HRM are critical for IRP2 degradation: Cys201, which binds the heme with Fe 3+ , and His204, which binds Fe 2+ containing heme. This is indicative of involvement of these residues in the tracking system for redox status of the heme iron and generation of oxidative modifications. Moreover, HRM in IRP2 plays the critical role in its recognition by ubiquitin ligase HOIL 1 [100] .",

Iron deficiency in the food of rats decreases the activity and amount of cAH and mAH protein in skeletal muscles, which is coupled with decrease of the amount of protein (but not mRNA) of mitochondrial IscS [101] . The mitochondrial protein frataxin is thought to be the iron donor of the systems for biosynthesis of the [Fe-S] clusters. It plays the key role in prevention of Fe 2+ catalyzed oxidative damage to mito chondrion. The available data show that recombinant yeast and human frataxins are capable of self association into large molecular ensembles that bind and store iron as ferrihydrite. Both monomers and polymers of human frataxin can be Fe 2+ donors for IscS [102] or for the recovery of the [3Fe-4S] + cluster of aconitase. However, a monomer cannot prevent Fe 2+ catalyzed free radical reactions and formation of insoluble ferric oxides. On the contrary, associated frataxin possesses ferric oxidase activity and detoxifies Fe 2+ by transforming it into a pro tein bound form [103] . Frataxin plays an important role in maturation of both mitochondrial and cytosolic iron-sulfur proteins. Frataxin depletion in HeLa cells decreases not only the mAH and succinate dehydroge nase activities, but also the level of iron-sulfur clusters associated with IRP1 [104] .

Similar changes in the properties of AH can be explained as mod ification of amino acid residues and the iron-sulfur clus ter. It is known that the sulfhydryl group of cysteine reacts with prooxidants with the formation of sulfenic, sulfinic, and sulfonic acids, forming disulfide and mixed sulfide bonds. The formation of sulfenic acids and disulfide bonds is reversible on treatment by reductants. Treatment with dithiothreitol of mitochondria isolated from myocardium after exposure to a 30 min ischemia and 5 min reperfusion completely restores the AH activity. Some data also demonstrate that, in spite of inhibition in the early period of reperfusion, exactly due to modifica tion of sulfhydryl groups, as expected, the mAH from myocardium does not degrade on further reperfusion but is reactivated, and the enzyme is found in association with frataxin [48] .",

            "text": "It has been supposed that Friedreich ataxia, a severe neurodegenerative disease, is due to a deficiency of mito chondrial or cytosol activity of iron-sulfur proteins. This pathology was previously described as an iron overload of mitochondria resulting in oxidative stress and the death of neurons. However, according to some recent data, the very fact of enhanced production of superoxide degrading the iron-sulfur cluster of AH does not explain the patho physiology of Friedreich ataxia [102] . Moreover, it has been shown that complete deficiency of frataxin does not induce oxidative stress in nervous tissue and the onset of the first stage of pathology (nervous or cardiac) as previ ously stated. It has also been shown that cAH activity pro gressively decreases while its RNA bound form increases, in spite of the absence of oxidative stress [104] . The pathology is probably associated with incomplete trans formation of IRP1 into cAH and slowed adaptive response to the increase in concentration of iron ions [115] . A mutant in the gene responsible for IRP1 trans formation into cAH was found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which resulted in identification of the cfd1 (cytosolic Fe-S cluster deficient) gene. Non lethal mutation in this gene decreases cAH activity by more than 90%. Besides, no Fe-S clusters were found in cAH. Protein CFD1 is supposedly localized in the cytoplasm [116] . At the same time, significant decrease in the iron content and RNA binding activity of IRP1 and IRP2 was observed in scrapie infected cells of mouse neuroblas toma N2a containing prions [117] .",
