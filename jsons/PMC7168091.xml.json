Treatment consists of regular injections of anti\u2010hemophilic factor concentrates given on an \u201cas needed basis\u201d (episode\u2010based treatment) or according to a regular schedule of prophylactic infusions (prophylaxis) to prevent bleeding and the debilitating complications that ensue from bleeding into joints, muscles, or vital organs and structures. The National Hemophilia Foundation's MASAC 1 and the Canadian Hemophilia Treatment Center Directors 2 both advise that physicians exercise their best judgment in advising patients about their options in terms of product for treatment of bleeding episodes. The choice of which factor concentrate to use is a difficult decision for parents of young children, adult patients, and their physicians. Factors that impact on this decision (Table I) include availability of individual products, their cost, clinical effectiveness, \u201cease of administration,\u201d and the safety of each product 3. In 2000, more than three billion international units of recombinant anti\u2010hemophilic factor concentrate were produced 4. This amount is capable of meeting the needs of only 30% of the world hemophilia population. The issues of cost and cost\u2010benefit of individual anti\u2010hemophilic factor concentrates are beyond the scope of this review. The reader is referred to an excellent review by Giagrande 5 on this topic. Similarly, data on the effectiveness of individual anti\u2010hemophilic factor concentrates is present in the literature 6,7. Prospective trials, retrospective analyses and case reports examining the effectiveness of individual products can be found in the literature and will not be discussed here.",

It is more than 30 years since the first cases of infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) were reported in patients with hemophilia treated with concentrates made from plasma 12. From 1971 to 1975 and 1975 to 1979, the annual incidence of HBV infection was estimated to be 7% and 9.5% 13. Currently, 90% of HBV seroconversions in patients with hemophilia are attributed to vaccination programs 14. According to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence of natural or acquired immunity to HBV among the 15,682 people with bleeding disorders participating in the Universal Data Collection (UDC) project 15 appears to be decreasing despite the availability and widespread usage of hepatitis B vaccine in childhood. This suggests that patients may once again be susceptible to HBV infection. The signs and symptoms of hepatitis following infection with HBV are present in about 70% of cases, of which about 5% develop chronic infection and 15%\u201325% of these individuals die from chronic liver disease 16.",

The second era was during the 1970's and 1980's when low and intermediate purity products derived from human blood were used to control acute bleeding and prevent bleeding with surgery.

Sentinel virus is a term that is applied to both HAV and parvovirus B 19, because these viruses may reflect the behavior of other potential, unknown pathogens that could be present in the blood supply. HAV is a solvent\u2010detergent resistant RNA virus, and parvovirus B 19 is a DNA virus that is heat resistant. The current viral inactivation techniques are not very effective against these agents and filtration techniques are used to remove these infectious microorganisms. HAV and parvovirus B 19 are potentially very difficult to eliminate from factor concentrates once present in source plasma 36. Therefore, donor screening to eliminate HAV and PB19 from source plasma is critical 36, 37, 38.",

However, Schneider et al., and coworkers found that PB19 was frequently present in recombinant coagulation factor VIII products 44. Moreover, another study indicated the presence of PB19 in young patients with hemophilia A 45. Similarly, circoviruses are also very resistant to treatment with heat, detergents, and disinfectants. Recent studies have linked novel circoviruses to serious post\u2010transfusion conditions. For example, transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) was discovered in 1998 46 and linked to post\u2010transfusion hepatitis 46, 47, 48. For this reason TTV has been of great interest to the hemophilia community. Azzi et al. 49 showed that TTV viral genome was present in first\u2010generation recombinant factor VIII and IX concentrates. On the other hand, the second\u2010generation factor VIII product Refacto and recombinant factor IX (Benefix) did not contain TTV.

From this point on HGV will be used to refer to GBV\u2010C. HGV is a member of the Flaviviridae family and its genome is similar to that of HCV. HGV has been found in FVIII concentrates and has been associated with acute and persistent hepatitis in humans. The long\u2010term clinical significance of such an infection remains uncertain. In general, human HGV infection appears to be mild or clinically silent 31. There have, however, been a few cases of fulminate hepatitis associated with HGV infection reported 51. In addition, a recent study questions the cause or effect relationship between HGV and HIV progression. The detection of HGV RNA in blood products and in plasma\u2010derived products further raises questions regarding blood safety 53. Additionally, HGV's prevalence is well established. For instance, 1.72% of US blood donors are infected with this virus 54, whereas in Japan the prevalence is 0.9% 55. In hemophilia patients the prevalence rate rises to 18% 54. If blood products are not treated with specific virucidal methods, it is likely that HGV will be present in factor concentrates.",

It is considered re\u2010emerging because of the cycle of outbreak and dormancy. In 1999, an outbreak of WNV in New York City deeply worried the scientific community in regards to contaminated blood supply used for transfusions. In 2000, WNV went dormant in the USA; only to re\u2010appear in 2001. The infection quickly spread. In 2002, 4 patients received organ donations from the same person. All 4 developed WNV infection. The incident sparked the need to test the blood supply for WNV. That year, a minimum of 21 cases of transfusion\u2010borne WNV infections were identified. The American Red Cross confirmed that 0.01% of blood donations tested positive for WNV (415 of 4.1 million donors). In some states the rate of infection is much higher, as in Kansas where it was 1:243 31. Nucleic acid testing (NAT) for WNV was licensed by the FDA in 2000. Importantly, virus inactivation steps commonly used during the manufacture of plasma derivatives, such as pasteurization for human albumin, solvent/detergent treatment for IVIG and FVIII, and vapor heating for FVIII inhibitor\u2010bypassing activity, readily inactivate WNV essentially eliminating this virus from the source plasma 56.",

The American Red Cross and others have in place a screening process to defer donors based on travel history, or recent health conditions, such as dry cough, or shortness of breath. Moreover, the donated blood undergoes several tests and inactivation procedures for HIV, HBV, HCV, and SARS, among other pathogens, which aim to ensure the safety of the nations' blood supply since the viral inactivation procedures are highly successful in elimination of lipid\u2010enveloped single\u2010stranded RNA viruses.",

AVF commonly infects birds, which is the natural host. Although, it is rare for AFV to infect humans, several outbreaks have been reported since 1997 81. None of these cases are known to have been transmitted through a human\u2010to\u2010human transmission route although this has been suggested indicating that the AFV may be mutating 82. It should be noted that to date, most of the reported cases seem to have arisen from human contact with infected poultry 81. Unfortunately, influenza viruses mutate often and can easily spread from birds to people and create an epidemic. Hence, it is crucial to aggressively monitor for new infections and any possible human\u2013human transmissions.",

Anti\u2010FVIII allo\u2010antibodies develop in 20%\u201330% of individuals with congenital hemophilia A who are treated for bleeding with factor VIII concentrates. The rate of inhibitor formation in patients with severe hemophilia A treated with the first generation recombinant products Kogenate (Bayer) 5,84, 85, 86 or Recombinate (Baxter) 25,87, 88, 89 is similar to that observed in patients treated with plasma\u2010derived products 90. Therefore, these data lead to speculation that the purer recombinant product is not necessarily a safer product from an inhibitor standpoint.

The advantages of recombinant factor concentrates include theoretical improvements in microbiological safety. However, this improvement is not without increased cost of therapy. There is no evidence to suspect that recombinant products are more prone to induce the development of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII or to be associated with allergic or other adverse events. For newly diagnosed and infection\u2010naive patients, similar to those described in cases 2 and 3 respectively, recombinant factor concentrates offer the benefits of reduced microbiological exposures. With respect to the different recombinant products, those formulated without animal or human proteins should be preferred as the microbiological risk, however small or theoretical, is likely to be further reduced, virtually eliminating the possibility of blood\u2010borne infectious disease. At times in the past, shortages of factor concentrates due to manufacturing regulatory issues have led to \u201crationing\u201d of products. If in the future, recombinant products are again scarce, the youngest and previously un\u2010exposed should preferentially receive priority for any available product.",

For example, the diminished hepatocellular disease in HIV\u2010infected individuals co\u2010infected with HCV when compared to those with HCV alone is due to the lack of an immune response against the HCV 53. Unfortunately, co\u2010infection with another agent, including emerging infections is likely to result in a less favorable clinical course, increasing the virulence of the pre\u2010existing infection. The patient described in case 1 is such an individual who already is infected with HIV and HCV. The introduction of another infection may result in progression of one or both of the pre\u2010existing infections. Therefore, irrespective of the infectious disease status of the patient with hemophilia, all should be afforded the opportunity to receive the safest factor concentrate, a recombinant product formulated without the addition of animal or human proteins and at a reasonable cost.",
