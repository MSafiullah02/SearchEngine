In December 2019, another coronavirus was discovered in patients with infectious respiratory disease in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, to have the ability for human-to-human transmission. The disease, now termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly all over the world, resulting in a pandemic. COVID-19 is induced by the pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is associated with 2,165,500 cases and 145,705 deaths as of April 17, 2020 (COVID-19 Map Johns Hopkins University and Medicine). The major phenotype of COVID-19 is severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), just like the disease caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (de Wit et al., 2016, Huang et al., 2020).",

The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to, but distinct from, the two other coronaviruses, as it has about 80% sequence identity with SARS-CoV and about 50% with MERS-CoV. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 is about 90% identical at the whole-genome level with two bat coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in eastern China. Protein sequence analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 has seven conserved non-structural domains, just like SARS-CoV, suggesting that the two coronaviruses are related. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. Thus, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cell entry receptor\u2014angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)\u2014as SARS-CoV (Kuba et al., 2005, Li et al., 2003).",

In this regard, two papers have identified ACE2 as cell entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020). In addition, Hoffman and colleagues showed that receptor-mediated virus entry was dependent on a serine protease, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Of note, clinically approved inhibitors of TMPRSS2 can prevent cell entry by SARS-CoV-2. Because alveola type 2 cells highly express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the steady state, these cells might be the primary entry cells for SARS-CoV-2 in the lung.",

This process requires S protein priming by host cell proteases, which entails S protein cleavage at the boundary of S1 and S2 proteins or within the S2 subunit. Analyzing which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry should provide insights into the viral transmission and reveal effective therapeutic targets. Hoffmann et al. (2020) performed a detailed analysis of the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. They demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 for entry and TMPRSS2 and the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) for S protein priming. They also showed that SARS-CoV-2 S protein (SARS-2-S) is efficiently cleaved at the S1/S2 site in 293T cells. Furthermore, utilizing replication-defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles bearing either SARS-2-S or SARS-CoV S protein (SARS-S), they showed that either S protein entered the cells with an identical spectrum of cell lines from various animal species, which is consistent with the amino acid residues essential for ACE2 binding by SARS-S being conserved in SARS-2-S (Lu et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020). In fact, both SARS-2-S and SARS-S entered ACE2-negative cells such as BHK-21 cells when the expression of human ACE2 or bat ACE2 was forced, but not with the expression of human DPP4 or human APN. Furthermore, an antibody against human ACE2 blocked both the SARS-S- and SARS-2-S-driven entry into human cell lines. These results indicated that SARS-2-S, like SARS-S, uses ACE2 for its cellular entry.",

SARS-2-S-driven entry into 293T cells (TMPRSS2-negative) expressing ACE2 was inhibited by ammonium chloride, an inhibitor of CatB/L, while its entry into Caco-2 cells (TMPRSS2-positive) was less efficiently inhibited. A clinically proven TMPRSS2 inhibitor, camostat mesylate, partially inhibited SARS-2-S-driven entry into Caco-2 cells, while camostat mesylate together with E-64d, an inhibitor of CatB/L, completely inhibited the entry, suggesting that both TMPRSS2 and CatB/L are involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry. However, the forced expression of TMPRSS2 rescued SARS-2-S-dependent entry into CatB/L-suppressed 293T cells, suggesting that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 is induced when cells express TMPRSS2 regardless of CatB/L expression. SARS-2-S-driven entry into lung cells is also inhibited by camostat mesylate. These findings show that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on surface molecules such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2.",

The AngII-AT1R axis also activates NF-\u03baB and disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), which generates the mature form of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands and TNF\u03b1, two NF-\u03baB stimulators (Eguchi et al., 2018). ADAM17 induction also processes the membrane form of IL-6R\u03b1 to the soluble form (sIL-6R\u03b1), followed by the gp130-mediated activation of STAT3 via the sIL-6R\u03b1-IL-6 complex in a variety of IL-6R\u03b1-negative nonimmune cells including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells (Murakami et al., 2019). STAT3 is required for full activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway, and the main stimulator of STAT3 in vivo is IL-6, especially during inflammation, although there are nine other members of IL-6 family cytokines that can activate STAT3, at least in vitro (Murakami et al., 2019). Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory system can activate both NF-\u03baB and STAT3, which in turn can activate the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp), a mechanism for the hyper-activation of NF-\u03baB by STAT3, leading to multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (Murakami et al., 2019). The IL-6 Amp induces various pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, and recruits lymphoid cells and myeloid cells, such as activated T cells and macrophages, in the lesion to strengthen the IL-6 Amp in a positive feedback loop (Figure 1\n). Importantly, because IL-6 is a major functional marker of cellular senescence, the age-dependent enhancement of the IL-6 Amp might correspond to the age-dependent increase of COVID-19 mortality.",

SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as cell entry receptors, followed by a cytokine-related syndrome, ARDS, which is induced by the hyper-activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, most likely in nonimmune cells including lung epithelial cells. ACE2 molecules on the cell surface are occupied by SARS-CoV-2. Angiotensin 2 (AngII) then increases in the serum due to a reduction of ACE2-mediated degradation. SARS-CoV-2 itself activates NF-\u03baB via pattern recognition receptors (PPRs), and the accumulated AngII induces inflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1 and IL-6-soluble (s)IL-6R via disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), followed by activation of the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 AMP), which describes enhanced NF-\u03baB activation machinery via the coactivation of NF-\u03baB and transcription factor STAT3. The molecules underlined indicate possible therapeutic targets for COVID-19, which is a cytokine release syndrome (CRS).",
