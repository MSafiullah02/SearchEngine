            "text": "The management of patients with cancer during the current pandemic of COVID-19 is challenging. As of March 30, 2020, more than 690,000 confirmed cases and more than 33,000 deaths have been documented worldwide [1]. Cancer patients require special attention, as decisions regarding treatment during the current pandemic require specialized consideration. The quality of care for cancer patients has been affected during this pandemic [2, 3, 4, 5] and strategies are required to deliver the best care. From a nationwide analysis in China, 18 (1%) out of 1,590 COVID-19 cases had a history of cancer [6]. Patients with cancer were more likely to be older and had more frequently abnormal computed tomography (CT) scans. More significantly, patients with cancer infected with coronavirus were more likely to have an adverse event defined as admission to the intensive care unit requiring ventilation or death (39 vs. 8%, p = 0.0003). Cancer patients also had a shorter median time to severe events (13 vs. 43 days, p < 0.0001). Cancer, as a variable, had the highest odds ratio [5, 3] for having adverse events. Despite the limitation of a small sample size and the heterogeneity of cancer patients, these results are concerning. Cancers differ in their pathogenesis and the urgency of starting treatment is not the same for all cancers. We report our personal opinions regarding the management of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) during this challenging time. The reader is advised that these recommendations are based on experience and are not evidence based.",

            "text": "The immune system in patients with MM is compromised by many different factors and patients with MM are at increased risk of infection [7]. The mean age at diagnosis for myeloma is approximately 65 and elderly patients are more likely to have comorbidities compromising the immune system. Lymphopenia at diagnosis is a well-known risk factor for developing infections [8, 9, 10]. This is a result of the myeloma clone suppressing normal B-cell development and function. A loss of functional immunoglobulins seen in most myeloma patients can also contribute to the increased risk of infection. Decreased CD+4 T-cell count at diagnosis is also associated with increased infections [11, 12]. Patients with MM receive treatment that causes more immunosuppression and increases the risk of infection [13]. Lymphopenia worsens after starting therapy for MM [10] and CD4 counts decrease with proteasome inhibitor (PI) therapy [14], and the risk of zoster reactivation is up to 13% without prophylaxis [15]. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) cause neutropenia, which increases the infection risk. Steroids are well known to increase the risk of infections (including pneumocystis and fungus) and the combination with IMiDs and PIs increases this further. The infection risk is highest during the first 3\u20134 months of therapy. Prophylactic levofloxacin for 12 weeks in newly diagnosed myeloma has been shown to reduce deaths significantly [16]. All of the previous factors make MM patients more susceptible to the serious adverse events that could arise with COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 can intensify neutropenia [17].",

For high-risk SMM based on the Mayo 2018 risk stratification [18], experts differ in their approach. Two phase III randomized trials evaluated the use of active therapy for SMM, one with lenalidomide and dexamethasone [19]and the other with lenalidomide alone [20]. There was improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in 2 trials [19, 20] and overall survival (OS) in 1 trial [19]. However, both trials had several limitations. In both trials, the sample size was less than 100 patients in each arm. In the Spanish myeloma group trial [19], imaging was done using X-ray, which is less sensitive than current diagnostic modalities (including low-dose CT skeletal survey and PET scans), and the benefit of survival in some patients could have been due to treating active MM (normal radiographs but abnormal PET or MRI), rather than SMM. In the second trial, there is no OS benefit to date and only 30% were high risk according to the Mayo 2018 risk stratification [20]. Also, 3.3% of patients had bone marrow plasma cells \u226560 and 8.2 % had serum-free light chains >100 mg/dL which are MM defining events by definition [20]and these patients may have been randomized to no therapy.",
