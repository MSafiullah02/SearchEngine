Its genome contains 8 RNA segments of negative polarity [polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), 3 PB1, polymerase acidic protein (PA), and hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), and nonstructure (NS) gene]. These viruses can exchange their gene segments in coinfected cells and produce progeny viruses with new genotypes. The unpredictability of the virus can be demonstrated by the recent emergence of the pandemic H1N1/2009 virus with genes originally derived from avian, swine, and human viruses (1, 2 ) . Such gene reassortment events play key roles in influenza virus evolution and have direct impacts on human health. The global cocirculation of pandemic H1N1/2009 and seasonal influenza viruses has raised concerns that these human viruses might reassort, thereby generating novel viral genotypes with altered virulence and/or transmissibility (3, 4 ) . Furthermore, surveillance has repeatedly detected pandemic H1N1/2009 virus in pigs (5, 6 ) . This provides the opportunity for the pandemic influenza H1N1 virus to reassort with other swine or avian influenza viruses that are endemic or transiently circulating in swine herds. Such reassortment events will have unpredictable public health consequences. Hence, there is an urgent need for tests that can rapidly identify each influenza virus gene segment to be of pandemic H1N1/2009 origin.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 585, "end": 588, "text": "(1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 589, "end": 592, "text": "2 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 937, "end": 940, "text": "(3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 941, "end": 944, "text": "4 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1033, "text": "(5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1034, "end": 1037, "text": "6 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "To differentiate pandemic H1N1/2009 from seasonal influenza viruses, we designed primers that target pandemic H1N1/2009, but not seasonal human H1N1 and H3N2, viral segments (Table 1) . These singleplex real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR assays were specifically designed to cross-react with the precursor genes of pandemic H1N1/2009 (2 ) (see below). RNA from viral culture or clinical samples was extracted as described (7, 8 ) . In this study we adapted a 2-step RT-PCR approach, which allowed us to reduce the cost of running the assays and to use the screened cDNA samples for other molecular analyses (e.g., sequencing). All the specimens were tested with blinding. For each specimen, cDNA molecules generated from a universal RT-PCR were used as DNA inputs in all the segmentspecific PCRs. For a typical RT reaction, 10 L reaction containing 5.5 L of purified RNA, 100 U of Super-script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 2 L of 5\u03eb FS (first-strand) buffer (Invitrogen), 0.1 g of Uni12 (5\u0408-AGCAAAAGCAGG-3\u0408) (9 ), 10 mmol/L of dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmol/L of deoxynucleoside triphosphates was incubated at 42\u00b0C for 50 min, followed by a heat inactivation step (72\u00b0C for 15 min).

These viruses were all confirmed to be swine H1 viruses and their gene segments were derived either from the triple reassortant (TR) or Eurasian avianlike (EA) swine influenza virus lineage (2 ) . It should be noted that all of the PCR-positive viral segments fall into the sister group of pandemic H1N1 (see online Supplemental Fig. 2) , which demonstrates the feasibility of using these real-time RT-PCR assays to detect genes from contemporary TR (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NS) and EA (NA and M) swine viruses (2 ) . All of these PCR-positive reactions, except those for the HA gene, had melting curves that are similar to those derived from the pandemic H1N1/2009 virus ( Fig. 1B and data not shown). In contrast, melting-curve signals of the HA gene derived from the TR-H1 swine viruses were found to be different from that of the pandemic H1N1/ 2009 virus (Fig. 1B The sequence similarity and diversity of influenza viruses were the major hurdles for the primer design of this study. We tried to test degenerated primers that can crossreact with both pandemic H1N1/2009 and its precursor genes, but these primers were found to be highly nonspecific. Nondegenerated primers were therefore deliberately used in this work. These nondegenerated primers might cross-react with genes from TR (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NS) and EA (NA and M) swine viruses, with some minor sequence mismatches. It should be noted that the NP of Sw/HK/2314/09 (TR swine lineage) and some NA in the EA swine lineage (e.g., Sw/HK/1105) were negative in the corresponding PCR (see online Supplemental Fig.  2) . These results were due to several major mismatched base pairs between the primers and targets. The primer mismatches observed in the NP of Sw/HK/2314/09 could not be identified in other swine NP sequences available from the Genbank. We also used these real-time PCR assays to test 3 avian (H5N1, H7N7, and H9N2) and 1 classical swine (H1N1) influenza viruses.
