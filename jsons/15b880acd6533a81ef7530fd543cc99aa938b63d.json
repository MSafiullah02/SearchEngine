SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed on acutely symptomatic 26 patients presenting with characteristic respiratory signs and symptoms. 4 Nasopharyngeal 27 specimens were obtained, and microbiologic diagnosis was made based on a positive result on 28 SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. We 29 included only patients in the reproductive age groups (15-49 years of age) who were admitted to 30 one of seven hospitals in our system and who were diagnosed with COVID-19 on RT-PCR on 31 admission, during the hospital stay, or postpartum period. Data analyzed in this study included 32 age (five age groups between 15 and 49 years), pregnancy status, and admission to an ICU. We 33 excluded patients with incomplete data. The incidence of ICU admission was compared between 34 pregnant and non-pregnant women with COVID-19 in each age group. Patients were admitted to 35 the ICU at the discretion of the consulted critical care attending physician. Other clinical 36 characteristics, including medical comorbidities, were not evaluated and not necessarily the 37 same. The Institutional Review Board determined that this study did not meet the definition of 38 human subjects research and was exempt from formal review. 39 were admitted to the ICU for worsening respiratory status, a difference that was not statistically 48 significant (p=0.22). ICU admissions by age group are shown in Table 1 ",

Therefore, our findings are 56 reassuring, and indicate that pregnant women infected with COVID-19 may not experience more 57 severe disease progression than non-pregnant women. 58 Intensive Care Unit Admissions by Age Group in Pregnant and Non-Pregnant Women 82",
