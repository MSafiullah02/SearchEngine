As educators, while we must focus on providing care to our patients, we must also focus on the safety of our trainees and colleagues. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended avoiding any gatherings with more than 10 people. 1 As a result, in-person academic activities, including teaching conferences, morbidity and mortality conferences, and simulation labs should be avoided. In addition, rotations between different sites, even while remaining within the same institution, should be limited or canceled, as rotating through multiple hospitals may significantly increase the risk to residents, patients, and other healthcare personnel. Finally, the American College of Surgeons (ACS), and even many government institutions, are recommending against the continuation of elective surgery, 2,3 and most facilities are minimizing participants in any operation to essential personnel only. These factors will undoubtedly decrease resident case volume.",

In addition, this technique is widely preferred by trainees. 6 This technique also provides trainees with a repository of video lectures that can be watched remotely at any time. Since the topics and objective tend to differ between junior (postgraduate year [PGY] 1-2) vs senior (PGY 3-5) residents, it is wise to have 2 separate tracks. This will allow for minimizing the number of participants in the \"classroom\" and allow for more interaction by the participants at the appropriate level.",

In a recent survey of participants, 100% found the platform helpful and 95% were likely to utilize it in their future ABSITE preparation. 7 Given our experience with the use of such technologies, we have adapted rapidly to the current restrictions on in-person education with continued use of flipped classroom model lectures, continuing our use of our social media group for daily questions and discussion, and with the following new strategies (Table 2) .",

We are utilizing a commercial online software (GoToMeeting (LogMeIn Inc., Boston, MA)) for these teleconferences that is free to users with a single paid institutional account. This format allows for trainees and staff to have a live video feed, so the lecturer can see who is currently attending, see responses of the trainees, and ask questions of specific audience members, which gives the feel of an in-person meeting from a safe distance. For the most part users are logging in from computers, but this program is also accessible from smartphones and tablets, which allows learner engagement from any location. Similar capabilities can be accessed through a variety of platforms, including Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, San Jose, CA), WebX WebEx (Cisco Webex, Milpitas, CA), and Skype (Skype Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). In addition, this format allows us to record all conferences (except for those with protected information, such as morbidity and mortality conference).

Due to self-quarantining and mandated staffing changes, more than half of participants were at home during the conference meeting time, and those in the hospital called in from computers in their separate offices. The session consisted of a preprepared lecture-based discussion with PowerPoint slides. With the teleconference platform, an interactive format was maintained with resident participation at multiple PGY levels. A straw poll after the 30-minute session showed that residents and faculty were happy with the format and were interested in continuing to attend remotely. From our early experience, we recommend using a platform in which users can submit questions through a live chat function. This decreases participant talk-over and allows for a more fluid presentation.",

These challenges can be overcome, however, through an investment of time and effort by staff providers with familiarity with these techniques. Specifically, for imaging, we have had success with recording short video while scrolling through cross-sectional imaging (making sure to avoid any patient identifiers in the recording), then playing this video on a shared display. One approach to mitigating the limitations on technology-savvy staff is to conduct such conferences at a multi-institutional or even regional level with rotating faculty among more than 1 program. This will have the added benefit of increasing the pool of faculty who will invest in these platforms, and adding the unique advantage of learning what other programs are doing. We are actively pursuing this type of experience with nearby institutions.",

To date, most staff providers have conducted these encounters alone. As it has become clear this format will be needed for some time, we are redirecting our efforts to keep residents involved with clinic and maintain this educational experience for them. Our clinic model is still in evolution, but currently involves trainees making the initial contact with patients who are sent to us for initial consult encounters, gathering a comprehensive history, then formulating a plan as they normally would. The trainee then discusses the case with the attending surgeon over the phone. The attending and trainee then conduct a multiuser video conference with the patient, so that the resident can partake in the final counseling of the patient and formulation of the final plan. Finally, the attending and trainee have a discussion after the patient has signed off to finalize the encounter. There are certainly potential issues with this approach such as patients with limited internet access and technologic capabilities, establishing rapport with patients without in-person encounters, the lack of a physical exam, and ambiguity about information security. 8 While these limitations are very real and we are actively working to improve this process, we believe this is an important and worthwhile initial effort.",

Depending on the setting, some programs may be able to augment resident learning with simulation in various forms. While simulation does not inherently involve meeting in large groups, simulation equipment is often located within the hospital, as it is for our program. Although we are looking for ways to get residents access to simulation equipment outside the hospital, we have discouraged residents from coming to the hospital unless they are on call and directly involved in patient care; therefore, their access to simulation is currently limited. For residents with access to a non-hospital-based simulation laboratory, these activities may be very beneficial to maintain technical skills through deliberate practice amidst the lack of operative cases.",

One limitation is the number of video libraries that vary widely in content and quality, with particular concern over the quality of freely available videos on platforms such as YouTube. 12, 13 This can be improved by ensuring staff oversight and discussion when viewing videos of questionable quality. Additionally, there are video libraries from surgical societies such as the ACS and Society of Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, 14 which do offer an alternative, but are incomplete and, in some cases, expensive.
