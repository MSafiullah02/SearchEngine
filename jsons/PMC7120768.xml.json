It is now established that the risk of diabetic complications is dependent on the degree of glycemic control in diabetic patients. Clinical trials such as the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [5] and the Stockholm Diabetes Study in type 1 diabetes [6], and the UK Prospective Diabetes study [7, 8] and Kumamoto study [8] in type 2 diabetes, have demonstrated that tight glycemic control achieved with intensive insulin regimes can reduce the risk of developing or progressing retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy in patients with all types of diabetes. However, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) showed that only 50% of diabetics have been able to achieve a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level, as an index of chronic glycemia, less than 7%; therefore, the only way to ensure the long-term health of diabetic patients is to maintain constant normoglycemia [2].",

HbA1C levels are a measure of glycemic control, and antidiabetes treatment aims to reduce HbA1C to as close to normal (<6.0%) as possible, without inducing hypoglycemia. Improved glycemic control is associated with significant reductions in microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy [7, 8]. In a meta-analysis, tight glycemic control has also been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease [9]. As a result, a clinical trial is currently investigating whether reducing HbA1C to less than 6.0% decreases the rate of cardiovascular disease and death [10, 11], which would be clinically beneficial as macrovascular disease accounts for approximately 50% of deaths in individuals with type 2 diabetes.",

Proper glycemic control and attainment of other nonglycemic management targets (e.g., blood pressure, lipids, body weight) are essential to the prevention of long-term complications of diabetes and to the reduction of overall disease management costs. Two prime examples of such therapy are treatment of hypertension and early stages of diabetic renal dysfunction with antihypertensive agents, and specifically with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and laser photocoagulation of proliferative retinopathy and clinically significant macular edema. The latest American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend a range of interventions to better improve type 2 diabetes outcomes. The ADA algorithm advocates a stepwise therapeutic approach that is based upon reduction in the plasma glucose concentration to achieve an HbA1C <7.0% [12]. Several therapeutic goals are recommended as summarized in Table 1 [13].\n\n",

The goal of pancreas transplantation is to safely restore normoglycemia by the provision of sufficient \u03b2 cell mass [18]. Transplantation of a pancreas is not a life-saving operation but it improves quality of life because patients do not need to inject insulin on a daily basis or regularly monitor glucose concentrations with finger sticks, and hypoglycemic unawareness is no longer a problem. The majority of pancreas transplants are simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation, the preferred treatment option for diabetics with approaching or coexisting end-stage renal disease [19]. The benefits of pancreas transplantation are clear: improved quality of life, prevention of recurrent diabetic nephropathy, freedom from exogenous insulin with euglycemia and normalization of HbA1C, less stringent dietary restrictions, less frequent blood glucose monitoring and stabilization of or improvement in secondary complications. The major disadvantages to the patient are the operative risk, the need for chronic immunosuppression, and the inherent side effects of chronic immunosuppression [18, 20]. The long-term advantages of this surgical procedure have to be balanced against the potential morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes, and the side effects from the long-term immunosuppression that is needed to prevent alloimmunity and autoimmune recurrence [18].",

Because many traditional immunosuppression regimens were known to be toxic to islets, Shapiro and coworkers [23] employed a modified immunosuppression protocol with a monoclonal antibody against interleukin 2, daclizumab, and eliminated glucocorticoids. Notably, both host-versus-graft and autoimmune reactions were avoided. However, despite short term success, long term insulin independence is usually unsustainable. Several follow-up studies indicate that even with the rigorous application of steroid-free immunosuppressive regimens, only a small percentage of the patients maintained insulin independence. Noteworthy, 80% of patients evaluated had fewer hypoglycemic events and decreased their insulin requirements 2 years after transplant [24, 25].\n\n",

            "text": "The Edmonton protocol is limited by several major factors: the lack of a sufficiently large source of islets due to the scarcity of cadaveric pancreas donors, and the presence of persistent immune rejection as well as the potential for recurrence of autoimmunity. There is still a slow and progressive loss of insulin production from transplanted islets in diabetic recipients over time, as evidenced by reports that 30\u201340% of islet recipients may experience recurrence of autoimmune diabetes with re-acquisition of insulin dependence 1\u20132 years post transplantation [23, 25]. A third limiting factor is islet revascularization, which appears to play an important role in determining the long-term survival and optimal performance of functional islet mass post transplantation. Rapid re-establishment of an appropriate microvascular system in newly transplanted islets is crucial for survival and function of islet grafts. Unfortunately, islets implanted at ectopic sites, such as under the renal capsule or in the liver and spleen, are invariably associated with markedly reduced vascularization, in comparison with native islets in the pancreas [26, 27]. This impairment in islet revascularization accounts at least in part for the demand of sufficiently large quantities of islet mass for restoration of normoglycemia in type 1 diabetic subjects. In addition, delayed and inadequate islet graft vascularization can deprive islets of oxygen and nutrients, causing islet cells to undergo cellular apoptosis and subsequent cell death, particularly in the core of large islets or in the center of aggregated islet clusters post transplantation. Moreover, a lack of sufficient islet revascularization may also compromise the optimal performance of transplanted islets. Indeed, there are clinical data indicating that even after postabsorptive blood \u00adglucose homeostasis is restored to normal post islet transplantation, implanted islets do not seem to function at optimal levels, as reflected in their significantly impaired glucose tolerance in diabetic recipients in response to intravenous glucose challenge [25, 28]. Thus, it is of great significance to define the molecular mechanism of islet revascularization and develop therapeutic angiogenesis approaches to enhance the process of islet revascularization. Such approaches are expected to ensure adequate microvascular perfusion to islet cells and protect implanted islet cells from hypoxia-\u00adinduced inflammation and necrosis, which will ultimately improve the outcome of islet transplantation by reducing the donor/recipient ratio thus increasing the success rate of islet transplantation [29]. Antioxidant supplementation [30, 31], elevation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) delivery [32] to islet grafts and co-transplantation of bone marrow\u2013derived mesenchymal stem cells [33] improves the outcome of islet transplantation by enhancing islet revascularization. Pretreatment of islet donors with exenatide improved graft function compared to post-transplant treatment of recipients only [34]. In addition, a combination of thymoglobulin and CTLA4-Ig prevented autoimmunity recurrence after islet transplantation, reverting ongoing autoimmune diabetes in animal models [35]. On the other hand, some immunosuppressive therapies, notably ciclosporin and tacrolimus, may induce insulin resistance and hyperglycemia and/or impair \u03b2-cell function and proliferation [36, 37]. However, metformin was effectively used for reversing immunosuppressant-\u00adinduced hyperglycemia in experimental animal models [38].",

The limitations of this finding are considerable, given that the reprogramming involved the use of viruses and the expression of the proto-oncogene c-Myc. However, alternative methods of cell transduction can be developed and somatic cell\u2013derived insulin-producing cells for diabetes therapy may be possible in the not too distant future.",

Insulin-producing cells in the liver might also be susceptible to autoimmune lymphocyte infiltration and apoptosis.

Also, research demonstrating that hepatocytes transfected with the PDX1 gene under the control of the rat insulin 1 promoter were able to produce insulin [67, 71] attracted significant attention and has inspired new hope. In these studies, sufficient levels of insulin were secreted to satisfy the needs of a diabetic mouse, which, when treated, became and remained steadily euglycemic.

They stimulate rapid, short-lived, insulin secretion [92]. They lower postprandial glucose levels, although fasting hyperglycemia is also improved. Meglitinides are more specific that sulfonylureas and are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia but clinical experience remains limited. These agents cannot further stimulate insulin release in patients on maximal doses of sulfonylurea derivatives. These drugs can be used in patients with decreased renal function [93] and for individuals with varying daily meal patterns. Experimental evidence suggests a better preservation of \u03b2-cell function compared to sulfonylureas [94] and improved vascular effects that remain to be clinically proven [95]. The NAVIGATOR (Nateglinide and Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research) study aims to assess the utility of these drugs in prevention of diabetes and their impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

It is a biguanide derivative that exerts an antihyperglycemic effect with minimal risk of hypoglycemia. Metformin lowers blood glucose concentration and improves insulin sensitivity by reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis and enhancing insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose uptake [12, 89]. In addition, metformin reduces insulin resistance in muscle tissue and the liver, decreasing postprandial hyperglycemia and inhibits adipose tissue lipolysis thereby reducing \u00adcirculating levels of FFAs [89, 96]. Metformin may also suppress inflammation independently of action on glucose, insulin and FFAs [97]. When used as monotherapy, metformin typically reduces HbA1C by about 1.5% [12]. Metformin also improves the lipid profile and lowers blood pressure and plasminogen acti\u00advator inhibitor-1 levels in both patients and animals with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes [8, 96, 98]. In overweight type 2 diabetic patients, metformin use is associated with decreases in macrovascular morbidity and mortality, effects that appear to be independent of the improvement in glycemic control [8, 96, 99, 100].",

In addition, metformin has been associated with rare cases of fatal lactic acidosis and is contraindicated in patients with renal dysfunction [101]. Furthermore, a study by Ting et al. noted that metformin use was associated with a risk of vitamin B12 deficiency [102]. The frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events may limit the ability to reach maximally effective doses, with rates of diarrhea and nausea/vomiting of up to 53 and 26% of patients, respectively [101]. Because of its efficacy, infrequency of weight gain or hypoglycemia, and low cost, metformin has been recommended by the ADA-EASD as first-line pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes [12].

They enhance insulin sensitivity reducing hyperglycemia and ameliorating the dyslipidemia and inflammatory milieu of type 2 diabetes [103]. TZDs improve insulin sensitivity in muscle and adipose tissue and in the liver by activating peroxisome proliferators activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) [12, 89, 104]. TDZs alter adipose metabolism and distribution and redistribution of tissue triglyceride from visceral stores, reducing levels of circulating FFAs apparently by sequestration in a less lipolytic subcutaneous compartment [105]. TDZs also reduce circulating concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote insulin resistance (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin 6) and at the same time increase concentrations of adiponectin, which has insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties. TZDs have also been shown to improve \u03b2-cell function, probably as a result of PPAR-\u03b3\u2013mediated decreases in insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell fatty acid concentrations [104]. TZDs have demonstrated the ability to conserve \u03b2-cell function, delaying or preventing the development of type 2 diabetes in a high-risk population of women with gestational diabetes in the TRIPOD (TRoglitazone In the Prevention Of Diabetes) and PIPOD (Pioglitazone In the Prevention Of Diabetes) studies [106, 107]. A large number of studies show that the TZDs are effective as monotherapy or in combination with metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. When used as a single agent, TZDs decrease HbA1C in the range of 1.0\u20131.6% and have a lower incidence of treatment failure than with metformin or the sulfonylurea, glyburide [88, 108, 109]. However, the TZDs are more effective when used in combination with metformin, sulphonylureas, or insulin [110\u2013112]. The TZDs should not be given to patients with heart failure because they typically cause fluid retention and peripheral edema, worsening heart disease [113, 114].",

A major adverse effect associated with clinical use of the thiazolidinediones is weight gain, which seems to be coupled to the effects of the drugs on adipose cell differentiation and triglyceride storage. Fluid retention is also linked to the PPAR\u03b3-\u00adagonist activity of the thiazolidinediones, leading to peripheral edema and a mild hemodilution in some patients [113, 117]. Fortunately, congestive heart failure is quite rare with use of thiazolidinediones, but remains a serious concern [118]. TZDs may cause hepatotoxicity and should not be used in patients with impaired liver function [119]; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends regular liver-function testing in all patients on TZDs. The use of TZDs has also been reported to (1) increase the risk of myocardial infarction and other CV diseases [120, 121], (2) decrease bone formation, accelerate bone loss, and increase the risk of fractures [122, 123], and (3) induce macular edema [124].",

In clinical trials, lixisenatide improved glucose tolerance, resulted in weight loss and lowered HbA1C, thereby causing significantly more patients to achieve target HbA1C levels compared with the placebo. Lixisenatide exhibited well-established GLP-1-related gastrointestinal side effects, with mild nausea occurring most frequently; a low frequency of hypoglycemia was also reported. The results of phase III clinical trial showed that in comparison with patients receiving placebo, a significant number of those given lixisenatide demonstrated HbA1c levels less than or equal to 6.5%. Lixisenatide therapy also significantly reduced the mean change in glucose levels from baseline 2 h after a meal. Treatment with the active drug was separately shown to reduce glucose excursion.

            "text": "The sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters (SGLTs) are a large family of membrane proteins involved in the transport of glucose, amino acids, vitamins, osmolytes and selected ions across the brush border membrane of the intestinal epithelium and the proximal renal tubules. There are two types of cotransporters: SGLT-1 and SGLT-2. SGLT2 is the primary transporter in the kidneys, and selective inhibition of SGLT2 has helped elucidate the functions of these glucose transport proteins. Inhibitors of SGLT-2 block the reabsorption of glucose (in the proximal tubule) from the renal filtrate, whereas the SGLT-1 inhibitors suppress absorption of glucose from the gut; these inhibitors help limit the amount of glucose that is reabsorbed and retained in the body [189\u2013191]. The SGLT inhibitors do not interfere with glucose metabolism, and thus, they are being used complementarily to mainstream approaches to glucose regulation, such as with the PPAR-\u03b3 agonists, DPP-4 antagonists, and GLP-1 analogues. The majority of inhibitors being developed as antidiabetic agents are selective for SGLT- 2 (Table 5), but there are some inhibitors of SGLT-1 and a mixed type of inhibitors. Most of the SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin (BMS-512148), remogliflozin, sergliflozin, AVE2268, 189075, 869682, and T-1095, are derived from the prototype phlorizin and structurally are glycosides (Table 5). The potential ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce plasma glucose levels without inducing increased insulin secretion or sensitivity, hypoglycemia or weight gain could constitute a new approach in diabetes therapy [191]. They are also promising for other therapeutic uses such as in obesity because they cause net loss of calories from the body.\n\n",

Chronic administration of the SGLT inhibitor T-1095 prevented the progression of diabetic nephropathy and suppressed the development of albuminuria and the expansion of the glomerular mesangial area [193]. Whether this occurs through a modulation of the TGF pathway is yet to be determined. It is also possible that such selective inhibition provides renoprotection through beneficial effects on glomerular haemodynamics, glycosuria, euglycemia and glucose toxicity of tubular cells [193]. The clinical importance of these findings is currently unclear. A recent study showed a reduction in infarct size and edema during induced ischemia in the middle cerebral artery in mice treated with an SGLT inhibitor [194], which suggests that SGLT inhibition can improve stroke outcome. SGLT receptors have also been found in human cardiac tissue [195], but the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on CVD are yet to be determined.",

Such declines in fasting glucose levels were sustained in Zucker diabetic fatty rats after 15 days of repeated dosing of dapagliflozin. Similarly, fasting glucose was reduced in streptozocin induced diabetic rats following administration of a single dose of dapagliflozin [196]. Clinical trial data are limited, but available evidence supports clinically significant reductions in fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and body weight with this agent [189]. In addition, dapagliflozin has demonstrated excellent tolerability with safety data demonstrated in both Phase I and Phase II studies. Results of ongoing phase III clinical trials are necessary to demonstrate efficacy and safety of this agent across various patient populations and clinical scenarios [197]. Dapagliflozin, and Canagliflozin are currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials (ADA 2010). Several double-blind clinical trials are under development examining canagliflozin.

            "text": "Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) is a recently discovered metabolic regulator. FGF-21 activity depends on \u03b2-klotho, a single-pass transmembrane protein. \u03b2-klotho physically interacts with FGF receptors 1c and 4. FGF-21 is produced predominantly by the liver and, to a lesser extent, also by the adipose tissue [146\u2013150]. FGF-21 exerts a unique role in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the liver, adipose tissue and pancreas [209]. FGF-21 stimulates glucose uptake in adipocytes in an insulin-independent fashion [147]. FGF21 injection in ob/ob mice results in an increase in Glut1 in adipose tissue. Another beneficial effect of FGF-21 is its ability to reduce the secretion of glucagon from the pancreas, and to lower blood glucose and triglyceride levels when administrated to diabetic rodents and monkeys. Its administration in diabetic primates led to a sustainable improvement in glucose control without occurrence of hypoglycemia, a significant improvement of diabetic dyslipidemia and a mild weight loss without any significant side effects [148]. FGF-21 preserves pancreatic insulin content and \u03b2-cell mass when \u00adadministered to diabetic mice. Moreover, FGF21 protects animals from diet-induced obesity when overexpressed in transgenic mice The function of FGF-21 in lipid metabolism and energy balance was recently emphasized by Potthoff and coworkers. They described the effect of FGF-21 on fatty acid oxidation and on PPAR\u03b3 coactivator protein-1\u03b1, a key regulator of energy homeostasis [210].",

Inhibition of PTP1B in muscle and liver, down-regulates insulin signaling, thereby improving insulin sensitivity [250]. These compounds have a low potential for hypoglycemia.

            "text": "The first steps towards the application of this innovative therapy in type 1 diabetes were made soon after the cloning of the insulin gene, in the late 1970s. Since then, a plethora of non-insulin producing cells that are not targeted by the immune system for autoimmune destruction (e.g. gut K cells, hepatocytes, myocytes, muscle cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, pituitary and exocrine cells) have been used to transform into artificial insulin-producing substitute cells. As true \u03b2-cell surrogates, they should be able to synthesize, package and store insulin, according to the metabolic needs, as well as to precisely respond to the blood glucose levels and avoid lag time in the secretory response. To achieve this, the pro-insulin gene should be engineered in order to incorporate a specific mutated amino acid sequence recognized by the furin protease to produce mature insulin, since the \u03b2-specific endoprotease involved in the cleavage and maturation of insulin in \u03b2-cells is absent in non-\u03b2-cells [257\u2013259]. A construct encoding this engineered cDNA can be expressed after gene-delivery using cell-specific promoters, viral vectors or nanoparticles [258, 259]. The use of synthetic promoters to regulate glucose-responsive insulin production may confer advantages to these therapies since they can partially override the unresponsiveness of these cells to glucose with physiological secretion of insulin. Indeed, a synthetic promoter library containing hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-\u00ad1), a CAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) response element and a glucose-\u00adresponse element was screened and it was found that the promoter SP23137 is highly effective on the production and secretion of insulin in response to glucose [260]. Still, this therapeutic approach faces other limitations. For instance, the fold-\u00adinduction of insulin release achieved by these constructs is smaller than that of the islets and insufficient to normalize glucose after tolerance tests. Thus, one can question the capability of gene-therapy-constructed nonpancreatic tissues to keep a stringent control over blood glucose concentration similar to the one provided by functional \u03b2-cells.",

            "text": "In opposition to ectopic gene expression of insulin, transplantation of pancreatic endocrine lineages reprogrammed from other cell types for \u03b2-cell replacement is also a possible and promising option. For example, it was shown that ectopic expression of human neurogenin 3 (NGN3) and pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1) in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells triggers pancreatic endocrine gene expression, notably insulin, glucose transporter 2 (Glut-2) and somatostatin, as well as other \u03b2-cell lineage-associated genes [261]. The systemic delivery of a PDX1 construct to the livers of streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice, using a first generation adenovirus therapy vector, was also shown to induce the activation of the endogenous pro-insulin 2 gene in the liver. This resulted in increased levels of serum insulin, glucagon and somatostatin and decreased levels of blood glucose that, despite the transience of the adenoviral constructs, lasted for a period of 4\u20136 months [72]. The ex vivo transduction of adult human hepatocytes with PDX1 also resulted in the induction of several \u03b2-cell gene products, and, upon transplantation under the renal capsule of diabetic mice, these cells did ameliorate hyperglycemia for prolonged periods of time [262]. Of noteworthy is the fact that transplantation of STZ-\u00adtreated mice pancreas with PDX1-transduced adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) significantly decreases blood glucose levels and increases cell survival. Moreover, PDX1-ASCs were shown to be stably engrafted in the pancreas, to acquire a functional \u03b2-cell phenotype and partially restore pancreatic function in vivo [263]. More recently, the transcription factor NKX6 was also found to activate immature pancreatic markers, such as NGN3 and insulin gene enhancer protein 1 (ISL1), in human liver cells, and NKX6 in complementation with PDX1 was found to promote insulin expression and glucose-regulated processed hormone secretion in hepatic cells [264]. Another relevant study showed that NGN3/Betacellulin (BTC) gene delivery and overexpression in the pancreas of STZ-diabetic mice is also able to restore glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and reverse hyperglycemia in these animals, rendering the neo-islets with a transcription profile similar to that of pancreatic islets [265]. The treatment further normalized the hepatic glucose secretion, reversed ketonemia and restored the hepatic glycogen content similar to levels observed in nondiabetics.",

            "text": "Type 1 diabetes is characterized by infiltration of autoreactive T-cells that mediate the destruction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells and, as such, several therapeutic approaches aim at controlling autoimmunity in this disease. One of these strategies consists of inducing and/or expanding regulatory T cells (Treg), more specifically of the Foxp3-\u00adCD4\ufeff+-expressing Treg (Foxp3+Treg) population, which are potent immunoregulatory effectors that modulate T cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) responses [266]. Deregulation of Foxp3+Treg has indeed been reported in diabetic patients [267] and described to result in systemic T cell-mediated autoimmunity in mice [268]. Administration of cytokines, such as IL-2 and TGF-\u03b21 has been used to manipulate T cell-mediated autoimmunity since they play critical roles in the maintenance of and/or differentiation of Foxp3+Treg. This approach offers several limitations, including the half-life of these proteins in the serum and, as such, the need for repeated administrations. Thus, an alternative approach to this cytokine-based immunotherapy is an inducible gene therapy strategy, which allows for the expression of the transgene in vivo and obviates the need for production, purification, and storage of recombinant proteins. Indeed, it has been shown that the intramuscular injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding murine IL-2 and TGF-\u03b2, followed by a short pulse of IL-2, is sufficient to prevent \u03b2-cell autoimmunity and diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice by increasing the frequency of Foxp3+Treg without nonspecifically activating and/or expanding T cells and other effectors cells [269]. Another study demonstrated that the transfer of the gene encoding the anti-\u00adinflammatory cytokine IL-4, using AAV vectors, directly to the pancreatic islets of non-obese diabetic mice prevents islet destruction by blocking autoimmunity, mainly through the maintenance of Foxp3+Treg [270]. Despite the benefits of the systemic expression of cytokines and other molecules by gene transfer to different tissues, the concern on the possible adverse effects resulting from this systemic expression on normal immune function remains unclear. These findings, however, suggest that gene therapy employing vectors that encode cytokines and other immunomodulatory proteins may also prove to be an effective and safe strategy to manipulate type 1 diabetes.",

GLP1, an incretin hormone that regulates postprandial blood glucose levels, has been suggested for the treatment of type 2 diabetes given its insulinotropic action. However, this protein exhibits an extremely short half-life due to its rapid degradation by the dipeptidyl peptidase IV protease. Gene delivery of GLP1 is a way to overcome this problem and effective experimental therapeutics were indeed achieved. For instance, delivery of GLP1 cDNA, using chitosan nanocomplexes, driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer, in Zucker diabetic fatty animals resulted in increased levels of plasma insulin and efficient clearance of the blood glucose in glucose tolerance tests, when compared to untreated animals [271]. Moreover, in vivo expression of GLP1 mediated by dsAAV vectors induces significant pancreatic \u03b2-cell proliferation, enhances \u03b2-cell mass and insulin secretion, and significantly delays the onset of hyperglycemia in db/db mice [272].",

One of the best examples for a possible gene therapy approach is proliferative diabetic retinopathy (DR). This pathology is the leading cause of blindness worldwide and is characterized by increased vascular permeability and retinal neovascularization [274\u2013276]. The eye constitutes a privileged organ to assess the effectiveness of anti-\u00adangiogenic therapies, since it is non-invasively available for imaging techniques that allow the study of progression of neovascularization. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is considered a central player in the regulation of angiogenis, and, therefore, has been proposed as the therapeutic target for treatment of late stages of DR characterized by neovascularization. However, currently used therapeutic approaches targeting VEGF in DR carry several drawbacks. Some of the approaches, developed and clinically tested to reduce neovascularization in DR, include intravitreal injections of antibodies that bind to and block VEGF action and its receptors, such as Ranibizumab (Lucentis) and Bevacizumab (Avastin). However, intravitreal administration is associated with increased intraocular hypertension and inflammation, whereas intravenous injection was observed to have significant risks of thromboembolic events. Another disadvantage of these therapeutic approaches is the requirement of frequent and costly injections. Therefore, alternative therapies that silence VEGF, for example by the use of vectors carrying specific interference RNAs against VEGF, are considered as a new generation of more effective strategies [256, 277].",

Intracerebroventricular injection of recombinant AAV encoding leptin in rats consuming a high-fat diet (HFD) have shown that leptin treatment reduces food intake and blocks the HFD-induced increase in weight, adiposity and metabolic variables. Blood glucose was shown to be slightly reduced but within the normal range. Treatment with leptin significantly augmented uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) mRNA expression in brown adipose tissue, indicating increased thermogenic energy expenditure [289]. Recently, it was also found that \u00adintracerebro\u00ad\u00adventricular and hypothalamic injection of recombinant AAV vectors encoding the leptin gene abolishes chronic hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in animal models of diabetes [290]. Gene therapy approaches to enhance leptin supply locally in the hypothalamus, although unconventional, may offer an efficient anti-diabetic treatment able to prevent and mitigate both type 1 and 2 diabetes [291]. Another example of a molecular therapy for obesity-induced diabetes relies on the hepatic gene transfer of CPT1A, the key enzyme in fatty-acid \u03b2-oxidation, or its constitutive active mutant form CPT1AM, to high-fat diet-treated and genetically obese mice using AAV vectors. CPT1A and, to a greater extent, CPT1AM, enhance hepatic fatty-acid oxidation, reducing the liver triacylglyceride content in these animals. Obesity-induced weight gain, increase in fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, and augmented expression of gluconeogenic genes were also restored to normal only 3 months after AAV treatment, suggesting a protective action of both CPT1 forms against diabetes and obesity-induced insulin resistance [292].",

            "text": "The goal of the most current therapies for diabetes is to provide a tight glycemic control in all patients in order to minimize the significant complications associated with hyperglycemia. However, glucose management remains a difficult problem. Thus, the interest on gene therapy approaches that might replace the ongoing therapies and avoid the development of diabetic complications is increasing. The preclinical gene therapy studies mainly aim at developing strategies for insulin replacement and suppression of molecular pathways underlying the loss of \u03b2-cell mass and hyperglycemic complications. Given the efficacy of these approaches in animal models of diabetes, the possibility of bringing them into the clinic is becoming more real. Despite this, there are still several obstacles to overcome. One of them lays on the identification of gene delivery systems that combine a high efficiency in cell targeting and gene expression with the least immunogenicity. To date, both viral and nonviral vectors failed to meet all these requirements. Viral vectors do not completely satisfy biosafety concerns due to their immunogenecity and to the random integration of their genetic material into the host genome, whereas nonviral vectors present a low transduction efficiency and lack of cell specificity. However, many efforts are being made towards the development of a good gene transfer technology, which, in parallel with the increasing knowledge on the pathogenesis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, makes gene therapy move closer to the clinic.",

The accompanying increase in the prevalence of diabetes-related complications and the occurrence of diabetes among younger adults, children, and adolescents is likely to have a substantial impact on healthcare costs, with cardiovascular disease and other chronic complications of diabetes accounting for more than one quarter of all direct expenses [3]. Patients with diabetes should be followed closely to ensure that they achieve and maintain both glycemic and nonglycemic treatment objectives. Given the loss of 80% of \u03b2-cell function at diagnosis of diabetes, as well as the 50% prevalence of pre-\u00adexisting coronary heart disease at diagnosis, a more aggressive approach from the earliest stages of disease is clearly indicated [294]. A number of new therapeutic strategies have been introduced [85], and a large number of new compounds are in various stages of development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [295] and this reflects the enormous impact of diabetes on public health.",

A cure for the disease may lie in the development of techniques to replenish islet mass. Some researchers have already directed the differentiation of ES cells toward an endocrine (Ins+) cell. The potential exists for liver and nonendocrine pancreatic cells to be reprogrammed by gene transfer or growth factor treatments to produce and release insulin in response to glucose. Recent evidence has suggested that adult \u03b2 cells are mitotically active and can replicate in response to increasing insulin demands. A complete understanding of the factors and signals that regulate this process could allow this innate ability to be controlled in patients with diabetes. Finally, cadaveric human islets represent a promising source of therapeutic \u03b2 cells through transplantation.
