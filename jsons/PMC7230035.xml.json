[5, 8\u201311] The majority of available information concerns the major risk populations, including adults with significant comorbidities and the elderly. [12\u201321] Consequently, there is an urgent need for information to guide the management of other patient populations. Development of such guidance is especially challenging in highly specialized fields with small target populations, such as pediatric nephrologists caring for children with kidney transplants, receiving dialysis, or being treated with immunosuppressive therapy for kidney disease. There is significant concern that such patients are more likely to develop severe disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection; yet, they may have an increased risk of exposure due to the need to have ongoing clinical care, including dialysis and laboratory monitoring. The current pandemic provides a challenge to the international community to develop new approaches for rapid analysis and dissemination of information to guide the management of patients with unique healthcare needs.",

In contrast to other data-gathering techniques, Delphi studies use feedback processes (iterations), to develop a consensus concerning a specific topic. This allows participants to reassess their initial judgments at a later time based on information provided earlier. [24] The first Delphi round started with an open email invitation to all EPDWG members to share their current knowledge, experience, information, and guidance for COVID-19 prevention, diagnostics, and management in their target population. Replies were gathered for 24 h. Information provided by the EPDWG members was analyzed using a modified form of meaning condensation analysis. [27, 28] Email replies were first read through to gain an overview of the collected data, after which themes were extracted and clustered according to common meanings. Clustered themes and corresponding quotations for each center were synthesized in a summary of finding table sent to all participants. Thus, participants could see the findings for each theme and center, including their own. The goal of the second Delphi round was to edit the wording, propose amendments, and check correctness of the summaries extracted from the experts\u2019 statements. A summary of findings containing the final version of clustered themes and participants\u2019 quotations for each center was created. In the third Delphi round, participants were asked to complete information on existing themes they had not addressed previously. Replies from rounds 2 and 3 were collected within 48 h. After the third Delphi round, no new information emerged and data saturation was achieved. Modified meaning condensation analysis [27, 28] was further utilized to formulate thematic questions and accompanying answer statements to systematically categorize the whole range of the specific, gathered knowledge. A set of clustered thematic questions and answer statements was created (Table 1). For the fourth Delphi round, this thematic question and answer statement set was circulated, and experts were asked to rate each statement with \u201ctotal agreement\u201d or \u201cno agreement\u201d in accordance with their local practice. We did not aim at consensus due to the descriptive character of our Delphi exercise, but rather aimed for rapid sharing of knowledge and practices to allow improved guidance of local management.",

However, testing of asymptomatic patients and asymptomatic HCP with varying risk factors markedly varied among EPDWG centers, likely reflecting decisions of individual expert teams responsible for clinical care, thus influenced by local expert attitudes and hospital policies. It is important to stress that criteria and strategies for COVID-19 testing are changing rapidly as the geographic spread of COVID-19 expands, as are physician attitudes and hospital policies. In accordance with current literature [5, 8\u201311], our study found no cases of confirmed COVID-19 in children with dialysis.

Responses concerning changes in current treatment were in consensus with recommendations from scientific bodies. However, state-of-the-art tends to be conservative, suggesting change to the status quo only upon presentation of clear evidence of the need for change. Some responses, such as those concerning testing strategies, prevention, and changes in routine care during the COVID-19 pandemic, varied widely among the EPDWG centers, reflecting in part rapid dynamic changes in the responses of national or local health authorities to escalation of the pandemic. Local hospital policies, physicians\u2019 attitudes, and available resources also significantly influenced the diverse patterns of responses among EPDWG centers. Future studies, performing detailed longitudinal assessments of these interdependent variables will be needed to obtain a deeper understanding of determinants of individual response patterns. Such studies should be able to compare the efficacy of any country-specific responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The COVID-19 pandemic is expanding in the United States with a lag of about 2 weeks compared to continental Europe.
