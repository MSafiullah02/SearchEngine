TRPC3 and TRPC6 expression were found to be upregulated in pulmonary arterial SMCs from patients with IPAH, and inhibition of TRPC6 expression markedly reduced SMC proliferation.24 The acute hypoxic vasoconstrictor response was also reported to be exclusively dependent on TRPC6 in mice with hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension.25",

However, preclinical data have been inconsistent. VEGF is upregulated in rats with chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, but downregulated in rats with monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension.33,34 The inhibition of VEGFR in rats in vivo results in septal cell apoptosis and emphysema formation.35,36 However, when VEGFR inhibition is combined with chronic hypoxia in rats, severe pulmonary hypertension with angioproliferative lesions develops,37,38 and when rats with established pulmonary hypertension are treated with VEGF, the disease is aggravated.38 The controversies regarding the role of VEGF in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension continue, as is evident from findings that gene-transfer-mediated VEGF overexpression in rats attenuates the development of experimental pulmonary hypertension (in monocrotaline-induced, pulmonary fibrosis, and hypoxic models),39,40,41 whereas inhibition of VEGF signaling by the small molecule multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in rats also attenuates experimental pulmonary hypertension (generated by monocrotaline or VEGFR inhibition combined with hypoxia).42,43 Overall, results indicate a unique and complex role for VEGF in pulmonary pathophysiology,44 but therapeutic applications are unlikely until the precise role of VEGF is elucidated.",

Four mammalian Notch receptors (Notch 1\u20134) and five ligands (Jagged 1 and 2, and delta-like protein 1, 3, and 4) have been described. These receptors and ligands are membrane bound; therefore, signaling occurs by cell-to-cell contact, leading to proteolytic cleavages in the Notch receptor, including a final cleavage by \u03b3 secretase to release the receptor's intracellular domain. The intracellular domain of the Notch receptor then translocates to the nucleus and forms an active transcription activator complex with the DNA binding protein CBF-1 and activates transcription of the HES and HEY genes, its downstream targets (Figure 3).84",

Cultures of pulmonary arteriole SMCs from patients with PAH display higher levels of mRNA and protein for Notch 3 and transcription factor HES-5 than SMCs from healthy lungs. Overexpression of the Notch 3 intracellular domain leads to an increased growth rate of these SMCs, whereas knock down of HES5 obliterates this proliferative effect.92 Moreover, treatment with a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor that blocks cleavage of the Notch receptor attenuates hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in mice.92 In summary, these data indicate that upregulation of the Notch 3\u2013transcription factor HES-5 signaling pathway is associated with development of PAH in humans and is needed for development of the disease in the rodent models of pulmonary hypertension.",

Cancers typically show increased 18F-FDG uptake and data suggest that proliferating pulmonary vascular endothelial cells from patients with PAH have a similar phenotype.167 Reduced oxidative phosphorylation inhibits the electron transport chain and reduces the generation of superoxide, which might confer resistance to apoptosis and so perpetuate the phenotype. If so, then restoration of oxidative phosphorylation would be expected to render cells more susceptible to apoptosis and offer a novel strategy for treating cancer and vascular remodeling in PAH.",

The development of right heart failure might be accelerated by maladaptive neurohormonal signaling, formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and exaggerated inflammatory responses.177 Although elevated right ventricular afterload leads to RVH, experimental data suggest it might not be sufficient to cause progression to right heart failure. Rats with afterload increased by pulmonary arterial banding developed RVH but not right heart failure, whereas rats with pulmonary hypertension induced by VEGFR inhibition combined with hypoxia did develop right heart failure, indicating that the remodeled vasculature in PAH might release mediators that interfere with adaptive RVH.185 The monocrotaline rat model might also help to shed light on the transition from RVH to right heart failure. Rats treated with 30 mg/kg monocrotaline develop compensated RVH, whereas rats treated with a higher dose of 80 mg/kg monocrotaline develop right heart failure. This model has been used to demonstrate that right heart failure is associated with myocardial expression of tenascin C and downregulation of integrin alpha 6, and the investigators suggested that the deadhesive properties of tenascin C might cause myocardial slippage and thus lead to ventricular dilatation.186",

            "text": "Advances in imaging also permit studies of disease processes in vivo.190 Molecular imaging using PET is an emerging illustration of a novel approach to investigating the pathology of PAH in vivo. PET imaging is widely used in oncology, and a variety of PET tracers in development permit measurement of cell metabolism, proliferation, apoptosis, tissue hypoxia, and angiogenesis in vivo. 18F-FDG is an example of a PET tracer that is used frequently. This glucose analog is transported into metabolically active cells by the same transporter as glucose and converted to 18F-FDG-6-phosphate. In contrast to glucose, however, 18F-FDG cannot be further metabolized and 18F-FDG-6-phosphate becomes trapped in cells at a rate proportional to glucose use. FDG-PET in patients with cancer exploits the observation that many cancers use glycolysis in the cytoplasm instead of mitochondrial glucose oxidation as a major energy source. Studies in patients with PAH show increased uptake in the lung,167 but at this time it is unclear whether this uptake represents vascular cell proliferation or inflammation. In an ongoing study in patients with IPAH,173 dichloroacetate is being used, and 18F-FDG uptake in lung and heart measured, to probe the relationship between aberrant glucose metabolism and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. Studies using new tracers (for example, 18F-labeled fluorothymidine and 18F-labeled fluciclatide) might inform us further on the relationship between active proliferation and angiogenesis and the natural history of PAH. Interestingly, FDG uptake is increased in the right ventricle of patients with PAH, and uptake is reduced by targeted PAH therapy (such as prostacyclin).174 FDG uptake, alone or combined with cardiac MRI, might prove a useful biomarker of cardiac function in PAH.",

The current assessment of patients with PAH is based on clinical phenotyping and fails to take into consideration the fact that PAH is a heterogeneous disorder. In neoplastic disorders, molecular signature analysis has proven useful in assigning prognosis and likely response to treatment. This assignment should be the goal in PAH management; patients with PAH are widely recognized to vary considerably in their response to treatment. For example, a small, but important, minority of patients with IPAH exhibit a pronounced acute hemodynamic response to NO inhalation, which predicts an approximately 50% probability of a favorable long-term response to calcium-channel blockers.191 Ongoing work to understand the molecular basis of this response, by comparing genomic sequences from responders and nonresponders, might provide a noninvasive test to guide the prescription of calcium antagonists for patients with IPAH. Circulating protein biomarkers, such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal-proBNP, and growth differentiation factor 15, can be used to stratify patients according to prognosis but have limited clinical utility for diagnosis or predicting optimal drug therapy. Genomic markers carry more information and offer greater promise, whether based on haplotypes, circulating cell transcriptomes, or microRNA profiles. The individualization of therapy in PAH is an exciting prospect, but we are still at the very beginning of this story.",
