            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that web-based interviews decrease costs significantly for applicants, decrease time burden by reducing time away from their home institution, and would help to mitigate scheduling conflicts that cause some applicants to forego an interview for another scheduled on the same day or next day. 4, 5 On the other hand, drawbacks exist including that web-based interviews limit informal interactions between applicants and residents that traditionally occur during the preinterview dinner and interview day. 4 Web-based interviews also prevent applicants from assessing the \"fit\" of a program or area, which is highly important when choosing where to train. Additionally, applicants are unable to tour residency institutions' facilities in person and evaluate the surrounding housing opportunities. 4 Given the public health dangers of COVID-19, conducting web-based interviews instead of in-person interviews is the ethical decision, especially if the pandemic persists. In Table 1 , we propose a web-based residency interview process to facilitate interviews in the time of COVID-19 while mitigating the aforementioned drawbacks of the online interview format. Web-based interviews should be conducted for all applicants, even those who can or want to attend in-person interviews, to promote a fair and just interview process. A well-implemented, web-based interview system has the potential to create a safer, more ethical and just interview process for all in this unprecedented time. ",

Word Count: 500 Abstract: N/A Capsule Summary: N/A References: 5 Figures: 0 Tables: 1 Keywords: academics; residency; interviews; residency match; COVID-19; travel; webbased interview Dear Dr. Dermatoethicist: I am a residency program director. Interviews are approaching to select residents and fellows. Due to social distancing measures enacted across the United States to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 1 and the inability to predict the future course of this pandemic, social distancing may persist for months. 1 What are the ethical implications of replacing the in-person interview with a web-based interview as has been done by some to replace in-person interviews with web-based interviews has ethical pros and cons involving the principles of non-maleficence, justice and consequentialism. Face-to-face interviews typically involve air, car, train or bus travel with extensive exposure to others. Public health authorities have advised social distancing to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. 1 Demanding in-person interviews would therefore potentially violate the principle of non-maleficence, or doing no intentional harm, as the requisite travel may cause applicants to expose themselves and others to COVID-19. On a national level, having tens of thousands of applicants travel for interviews could have disastrous public health implications.Justice suggests that the interview process should be conducted in an equitable manner for all applicants. Criticisms of the current in-person interview process include its high financial cost expended on travel and hotels, 3 which disproportionately disadvantages students of a low socioeconomic background. Pilot studies of web-based residency interviews have demonstrated that they decrease costs significantly for applicants.4,5 Moving towards a web-based interview system may thus inadvertently create a more fair interview process for all.Consequentialism, or the evaluation of an action by its consequences, should be considered as there are a number of consequences that may result from the implementation of a web-based interview process, some positive and some negative.",
