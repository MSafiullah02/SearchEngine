Among TLRs, TLR3 recognizes dsRNA and is therefore important for defense against viral infections. Upon recognition of viral dsRNA, TLR3 transmits signals that activate transcription factors responsible for the induction of type I interferon (IFN; IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and IFN-inducible genes, which play critical roles in antiviral host defense (Matsumoto et al., 2002). Thus, activation of TLR3 signaling is of great importance for defense against BRV, a dsRNA virus, and BCV and BVDV, which replicate via intermediary dsRNA.",

The majority of studies aimed at dissecting the mechanisms of TLR3 function have been performed principally in mouse and human cell lines (Gauzzi et al., 2010). However, few studies have been conducted on cattle, despite growing interest in the bovine immune system due to the economic importance of cattle as livestock. Therefore, investigating how TLR3 mediates antiviral defenses in bovine IECs is important for understanding the activation and regulation of the intestinal immune system of cattle. Moreover, determining the underlying mechanisms of TLR3 activation and regulation in bovine IECs may aid in the development of effective therapies for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases, such as oral vaccines and functional feed, which specifically target anti-viral immune responses in the bovine gut.",

Cytokines, chemokines, and \u03b2-actin cDNAs for real-time PCR analysis were amplified using the primers listed above. The PCR products were inserted into the vector pGEM-T Easy DNA (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using standard techniques. We confirmed the sequence of each insert with the dideoxy chain-termination method using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The constructed plasmid vectors were applied to calculate the relative expression levels of each cDNA in samples by the relative standard curve method. The expression levels of \u03b2-actin were used to normalize individual cytokine and chemokine cDNA expression levels in the samples. The relative index of cytokine mRNA in BIE cells stimulated with LAB was calculated by first averaging the target cytokine expression levels from a minimum of three samples stimulated with poly(I:C) and without pre-treatment with LAB. After setting this value as 1, the relative expression of LAB pre-stimulated samples following poly(I:C) stimulation was then calculated.",

BIE cells were stimulated with the different LAB strains for 48 h and then challenged with poly(I:C) (Fig. 3\n). The determination of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression levels at 3 h (Fig. 3A) and 12 h (Fig. 3B) post-stimulation with poly(I:C) revealed that only L. rhamnosus LA-2 and S. thermophilus TMC1543 were able to increase IFN-\u03b2 levels after 12 h when compared to controls. Notably, the effect of L. rhamnosus LA-2 exposure was superior to that of S. thermophilus TMC1543. In addition, we observed that L. rhamnosus LA-2 induced the down-regulation of IL-6 after 3 h (Fig. 3A), while S. thermophilus TMC1543, L. casei TMC0409, and both B. bifidum strains had reduced the expression of IL-6 by 12 h (Fig. 3B).

Epithelial cells, more than any other cell type, express TLR3 in numerous organs, including the gastrointestinal tract (Cario and Podolsky, 2000). It was reported that human IECs express low levels of TLR2 and TLR4, whereas TLR3 appears to be abundantly expressed in the normal human small intestine and colon (Cario and Podolsky, 2000). In addition, our laboratory has previously shown that TLR3 is also strongly expressed in swine IECs (Moue et al., 2008). Moreover, TLR3 transcription in bovine colonic epithelium was recently described for the first time (Bridger et al., 2010). In the present study, immunohistochemical analyses revealed abundant expression of TLR3 in BIE cells. Therefore, BIE cells, in addition to displaying characteristics of epithelial cells, such as cobblestone morphology, microvilli-like structures, and strong expression of cell-to-cell junctional proteins and cytokeratin (Miyazawa et al., 2010), also express TLR3 and thus resemble the IECs of other species.",

The antiviral effects of immunobiotics have also been examined in a few animal cell lines. For example, Maragkoudakis et al. (2010) reported that probiotics are able to protect porcine and goat epithelial cells against rotavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus challenges; however, the immunological mechanisms involved in the protective effect were not determined. Recent studies have also demonstrated that probiotics significantly decrease IL-6 production by porcine IPEC-J2 cells infected with porcine rotavirus, suggesting that probiotics have immunoregulatory effects (Liu et al., 2010). To our knowledge, no prior studies have investigated the effects of probiotics in bovine IECs lines. Therefore, we evaluated whether our bovine in vitro system could be used for the selection of LAB strains with antiviral immune-enhancing activities.",

Notably, L. rhamnosus GG and S. thermophilus TMC1543 were the only strains able to increase IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 mRNA, respectively, in BIE cells after 48 h of stimulation. In addition, only L. rhamnosus LA-2 increased MCP-1 mRNA, while this bacterium, L. casei TMC0409, and both B. bifidum strains up-regulated IL-8.

In addition, TLR2 agonists are able to induce IFN-\u03b2 transcription (Dietrich et al., 2010). Moreover, it was observed that certain lactobacilli trigger the expression of IFN-\u03b2 genes in dendritic cells in a TLR2-dependent manner (Weiss et al., 2010). In our present analyses, we therefore expected to identify strains capable of increasing IFN-\u03b2 levels in BIE cells; however, we only detected a slight increase of this cytokine in BIE cells treated with L. rhamnosus GG. In addition, we found that the TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 was not able to modify the expression of IFN-\u03b2 in BIE cells.

The increased production of IFN-\u03b2 by BIE cells in response to TLR3 activation induced by L. rhamnosus LA-2 may have significant in vivo effects in the protection against enteric viruses. Global gene-expression analyses of bovine intestinal tissues following infection with BRV or BCV indicate that several IFN-regulatory and -stimulatory genes are down-regulated, supporting the conclusion that both viruses may have evolved mechanism(s) to inhibit IFN-mediated immune responses (Aich et al., 2007). Moreover, it was shown that BVDV significantly interferes with the induction of type I IFN, which impairs not only innate defenses, but also interferes with the establishment of adaptive immune responses (Peterhans et al., 2003, Lee et al., 2008). Based on these findings, L. rhamnosus LA-2, which enhances IFN-\u03b2 production in BIE cells, may play an important role in the improvement of innate and specific immune responses against bovine intestinal virus. Thus, our studies with the BIE cell line have allowed us to identify a LAB strain that is a good candidate for future in vivo studies.",

It was reported that TLR3 mediates harmful inflammatory responses in the intestine, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of viral infections (Zhou et al., 2007). Therefore, the lower production of pro-inflammatory cytokines following exposure to L. casei TMC0409 may allow for the efficient regulation of inflammatory responses and avoidance of tissue injury, offering a different protection mechanism against bovine viral infection.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the in vitro system described in this study was useful for the primary screening of two types of immunomodulatory LAB strains that would be able to protect against viral intestinal diseases in cattle: strains capable of increasing antiviral defenses and strains with anti-inflammatory capacities. To define the characteristic immunomodulatory abilities of individual LAB strains, their influence on cytokine production after challenge of BIE cells with TLR3 agonist can be studied using statistical multi-comparison tests, as shown in Fig. 3C. We also demonstrated that TLR3 is expressed in BIE cells and that these cells respond to stimulation with the TLR3 agonist poly(I:C). Characterization of the inflammatory immune response triggered by TLR3 activation in BIE cells showed that this in vitro system can be used for the study of TLR3-mediated immune responses in bovine IECs. In addition, our findings indicate that BIE cells are useful for the primary screening of immunobiotic LAB strains which are able to beneficially modulate the antiviral immune response triggered by TLR3 activation in bovine IECs. Although it is difficult at present to predict if the observed in vitro changes in gene expression are biologically relevant in vivo, given the diverse factors capable of influencing intestinal immune responses, we propose that BIE cells can serve as a useful in vitro tool to identify a small number of potentially immunobiotic strains which can then be subjected to appropriate in vivo trials. In fact, the use of immunobiotic microorganisms in animal feeding is expected to be enhanced by preliminary host-specific in vitro screening tests. The present characterization of BIE cells represents an important step towards the establishment of a valuable bovine in vitro system that could be used for the development of immunomodulatory feed for bovine hosts.",
