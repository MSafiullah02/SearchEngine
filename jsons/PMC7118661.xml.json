Fortunately, by February 15, 2020 the daily number of new reported cases in China started to decline across the country although Hubei Province reported 128 cases on average per day in the week of March 2-8, 2020 (WHO, 2020). While the epidemic continues to decline in China, 24,727 COVID-19 cases have been reported in more than 100 countries outside of China including South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, Germany, and France (WHO, 2020). In particular, South Korea quickly became one of the hardest hit countries with COVID-19, exhibiting a steadily increasing number of cases over the last few days. Hence, it is crucial to monitor the progression of these outbreaks and assess the effects of various public health measures including the social distancing measures in real time.",

The epicenter of the South Korean COVID-19 outbreak has been identified in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million people, approximately 150 miles South East of Seoul. The rapid spread of COVID-19 in South Korea has been attributed to one case linked to a superspreading event that has led to more than 3,900 secondary cases stemming from church services in the city of Daegu (Kuhn, 2020, Ryall, 2020). This has led to sustained transmission chains of COVID-19, with 55% of the cases associated with the church cluster in Daegu (Bostock, 2020). Moreover, three other clusters have been reported including one set in Chundo Daenam hospital in Chungdo-gun, Gyeongsanggbuk-do (118 cases), one set in the gym in Cheonan, Chungcheongnam-do (92 cases), and one Pilgrimage to Israel cluster in Gyeongsanggbuk-do (49 cases). These few clusters have become the major driving force of the infection. A total of 33 cases were imported while the four major clusters are composed of local cases as described in Table 2\n.",

To respond to the mounting number of cases of COVID-19, the Korean government has raised the COVID-19 alert level to the highest (Level 4) on February 23, 2020 to facilitate the implementation of comprehensive social distancing measures including enhanced infection control measures in hospitals, restricting public transportation, cancelling social events, and delaying the start of school activities (Kim, 2020).",

This key epidemiological parameter tracks the average number of secondary cases generated per case as the outbreak progresses over time. Steady values of Rt above 1 indicate sustained disease transmission, whereas values of Rt <1 do not support sustained transmission and the number of new cases is expected to follow a declining trend.

For the COVID-19 data in Korea, the symptom onset dates are available for only the first 28 reported cases. Moreover, all of the dates of symptoms onset are available for the imported cases. Therefore, we utilize this empirical distribution of reporting delays from the onset to diagnosis to impute the missing dates of onset for the remainder of the cases with missing data. For this purpose, we reconstruct 300 epidemic curves by dates of symptoms onset from which we derive a mean incidence curve of local case incidence and drop the last three data points from the analysis to adjust for reporting delays in our real-time analysis (Tariq et al., 2019).",

Using the Korean incidence curves for imported and local cases, we estimate the evolution of Rt for COVID-19 in Korea. First, we characterize daily local case incidence using the generalized growth model (GGM) (Viboud et al., 2016). This model characterizes the growth profile via two parameters: the growth rate parameter (r) and the scaling of the growth rate parameter (p). The model captures diverse epidemic profiles ranging from constant incidence (p=0), sub-exponential or polynomial growth (0<p<1), and exponential growth (p=1) (Viboud et al., 2016). The generation interval is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with a mean of 4.41 days and a standard deviation of 3.17 days (Nishiura et al., 2020, You et al., 2020).",

Such superspreading events have been reported earlier for the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea (Cowling et al., 2015).
