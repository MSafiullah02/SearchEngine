While AR poses potential long-term problems globally, currently, patients with AR have worse outcomes including prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and increased morbidity and risks of mortality [2]. These factors are worsened in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) where infrastructure is lacking and the availability of second- and third-line antibiotic therapies that may be more effective are not widely available [3]. Control of AR requires surveillance to understand the magnitude and burden in LMICs, but this is challenging in many countries because of limited financial and human resources for health capacity and poor laboratory infrastructure for microbiological diagnosis [1, 4]. Increasing antibiotic consumption fueled by improving economies in LMICs poses a threat to the control of AR [5].",

Although estimates from LMICs suggest that the HAI rate is at least 3 times higher than in the USA [10, 11], however, studies are limited, particularly in Africa, where the burden of HAIs remains largely unknown or underestimated. The lack of surveillance in Africa is due to the complexities in diagnosis and the limited resources required for surveillance to guide interventions. Even though sub-Saharan African countries have committed to control antibiotic resistance in their countries [12], due to a lack of resources and other pressing issues there is, as yet, little effort at scaling up activities on prevention and control of antibiotic resistance. In the WHO African region, only Ethiopia and South Africa had a national antimicrobial resistance plans in place and neither of the countries in this region has a national antimicrobial surveillance system [13].Further compounding the problem is the limited availability of data on antibiotic resistance by a large number of African countries [14]. In a systematic review of the burden of antimicrobial resistance in West Africa, Sierra Leone was singled out among other countries due to paucity of the AR data available [15].",
