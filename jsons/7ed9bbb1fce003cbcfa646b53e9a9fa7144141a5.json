J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 Graphical abstract Abstract The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as a global pandemic, but specific medicines and vaccines are still being developed. In China, interventional therapies with traditional Chinese medicine for COVID-19 have achieved significant clinical efficacies, but the underlying pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear. This article reviewed the etiology of COVID-19 and clinical efficacy. Both network pharmacological study and literature search were used to demonstrate the possible action mechanisms of Chinese medicines in treating COVID-19. We found that Chinese medicines played the role of antivirus, anti-inflammation and immunoregulation, and target organs protection in the management of COVID-19 by multiple components J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3",

Then, the virus continued to infect other organs through ACE2, such as the heart, kidneys, and liver by blood circulation. It further triggered an excessive immune response, such as the imbalance of T-helper-1 (Th1) and Th2 cells, which produced numerous inflammatory cytokines, causing a cytokine storm and leading to MODS ultimately. CMs can play a direct or indirect role in protecting target organs by inhibiting the binding of the virus to ACE2 to produce anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-fibrosis, and expectorant action [71] . [45] found that Jinhua Qinggan granules played a role in regulating apoptosis via PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and Ras pathways. Ling [48] reported that 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, stigmasterol, indigo, \u03b2-sitosterol, luteolin, quercetin and naringenin in Lianhua Qingwen Prescription might target on ACE2 and protect the target organs of COVID-19 through the renin-angiotensin pathway. Xu [56] predicted that MAPK8, MAPK1, MAPK14, FOS, CASP3, endocrine resistance, EGFR tyrosine kinase resistance, platinum drug resistance, antifolate resistance, arginine biosynthesis, and MAPK signaling pathways could be involved in the inhibition of cell apoptosis and pulmonary fibrosis by Shufeng Jiedu capsule.",

The results ( Table 2) China and generated some useful information, these researches only analyzed these formulae and medications individually. The results of these researches could reflect more on the unique features of individual formula and medication and less on the general features of these formulae and medications. To understand the general features of these formulae and medications, we selected TMTD to screen the common components and then analyzed the targets and signaling pathways that these components may act on using networking analysis. The common components of TMTD were generated by using the SymMap database (https://www.symmap.org/) and TBtools software (V0.665). The results (Fig. 2) shows that there are total 401 compounds in TMTD, of which ten compounds are shared by the six formulae of TMTD, they are ursolic acid, thymol, sucrose, rutin, physcion, oleanolic acid, caffeic acid, \u03b2-terpinene, \u03b2-sitosterol, and \u03b2-elemene. We believe that the common action mechanisms of TMTD also lies in these ten compounds. Therefore, we further predicted the possible targets and signaling pathways that the ten compounds may act on by network pharmacology analysis. The results shown that the potential targets are FGF2, (Fig. 3) . The network shows that the common action mechanisms of TMTD in the treatment of COVID-19 could be related to signal transduction, immune system, and cell growth and death.",

The overall concept and treatment methods are based on syndrome differentiation, which is the most significant and essential feature. In China, doctors are recommended to use different CMs and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f probability as we have done in a classic Chinese medicine formula Gualuo Xiebai decoction [33]. To understand the current status of researches on the mechanisms of CMs in treating COVID-19, we searched several medical databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), from 2019 till now with the subjects of Chinese medicines, mechanism, and COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2. From the retrieved literature, we further screened the literature by selecting computer-simulated or experimental researches, such as network pharmacology, in vivo or in vitro studies on COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 with recommended formulas or Chinese patent medicines in the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 of China [4], and excluding duplicates, reviews, case reports, and studies on other viruses or diseases, etc. Finally, two in vitro study in English, twenty-five network pharmacology studies in Chinese and one in English were selected and analyzed. The result showed that the action mechanisms of CMs in treating COVID-19 were multidimensional",

Nevertheless, the current understanding of the mechanisms of CMs is mainly produced from virtual simulation through molecular docking and network pharmacology analysis. The focus and strategy in different research are somehow different; the ingredients, targets, and pathways predicted in these researches might have certain limitations. To confirm these predicted mechanisms, well designed in vitro cell experiments and in vivo animal studies basedon these predictions are needed. Importantly, the multiple omic technologies, such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, should be applied to analyze the biofluid and tissue samples collected from COVID-19 patients who received TCM treatment in well designed and controlled clinical trials to verify these mechanisms[72].",
