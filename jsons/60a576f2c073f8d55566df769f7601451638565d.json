            "text": "As already mentioned by the authors, during SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) infection, pre-existing disorders (such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity) are detrimental augmenting the risk of severe respiratory syndrome and consequent higher mortality rate. Hence, when no signs of infection are present, it is even more crucial not to interfere, without a proper indication, with the basal balance of a complex multifaceted disease such as PsA. It goes without saying that if any signs or symptoms suggestive for infection occur, caused by SARS-CoV-2 or any other infectious etiology, patients should follow their current practice of interrupting immunosuppressive therapy. Emerging evidence describes a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 characterized by a cytokine storm, with increased level of multiple mediators-IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, TNF-alpha, ferritin-reflecting hyperinflammation. 5 Given these observations, in China it has recently been approved a multicenter randomized controlled (ChiCTR2000029765) trial using tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blockade indicated in many rheumatic diseases) in patient with elevated IL-6 and SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. 6 Moreover, a phase 2 study has been approved by the Italian Regulatory Drug Agency and will enroll 330 patients with pneumonia and early respiratory failure, with mortality reduction at 1 month as primary outcome (Multicenter study on the efficacy and tolerability of tocilizumab in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia). When lung and systemic injury results from a hyperactivation of the immune system, immunosuppression might be considered as a therapeutic option, supporting the intricacy of the interaction among the virus and the immunological response depending on every single individual.",
