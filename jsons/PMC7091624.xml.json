            "text": "Mucositis is an inevitable side-effect of the intensive conditioning therapy used for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation1 and usually refers to the mucosal ulceration of mouth and throat. However, it is generally accepted that oral mucositis is in reality the most obvious manifestation of damage or injury elsewhere particularly that of the gut. Hence, mucosal barrier injury (MBI) may be a more appropriate term for this biological process. There exists no clear definition of MBI which is defined by a constellation of signs and symptoms that vary in their clinical expression. Oral MBI is reported to affect 60% to 100% of transplant recipients23 and is characterised by pain, oedema, erythema, lesions, pseudomembrane formation, excessive mucous production, reduced saliva and bleeding, all of which reduce the patient's ability to eat and drink. In contrast, there are no reliable data on the incidence of gut MBI although intestinal symptoms affect almost every transplant recipient to some extent and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping and watery diarrhoea occasionally accompanied by macroscopic blood loss. The exact course and severity of bowel symptoms of MBI are also difficult to ascertain because many patients are in such pain due to oral MBI that they only gain relief from narcotic analgesia which induces constipation as a result of reduced gut motility. There are also a number of scoring systems for oral MBI4 although none is universally accepted and all lack standardisation. As yet, there is no system for registering gut MBI although there are published definitions for grading toxicity of individual signs and symptoms. Consequently, much more is known about the course of oral MBI than its intestinal counterpart. Oral MBI is known to begin around the time conditioning therapy is completed, and has been shown to worsen until a peak is reached after which it declines gradually until resolving completely. The onset and duration of mucositis has also been shown to mirror the course of neutropenia5 (Figure 1). This phenomenon may not be peculiar to any one specific regimen. It would therefore be of considerable interest were gut MBI shown to follow a similar course to oral MBI.",

Ionising radiation also induces cytokine gene expression directly.8 TNF-\u03b1 and its receptors are activated and suggest that resident tissue macrophages and monocytes rather than circulating polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells are the main target in vivo.9 Tissue macrophages are not eliminated by conditioning therapy and may persist up to 4 months after transplantation. In the gut, macrophages reside in the gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) which houses the vast majority of total circulating lymphocytes as well as other members of the lymphoreticular system such as monocytes and intraepithelial lymphocytes. Once released into the circulation, the cytokines increase expression of HLA histocompatibility antigens and critical adhesion molecules that amplify local tissue injury by inviting PMN cells and activated lymphocytes to invade.10 This results in increased vascularity and probably higher local levels of cytotoxic agents. In an animal model, exposure to bleomycin or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resulted in increased cellularity of subepithelial oral tissue, vascular dilation and leukocyte margination within 24 h.11 The generation of cytokines is self-limited during autologous transplantation and resolves within 7\u201310 days.10",

Anti-metabolites, for example cytarabine, are cell cycle-dependent and interfere with the synthesis of DNA in dividing cells whereas the intercalating agents such as the anthracyclines are more effective during the G2 phase after mitosis is complete when the cell has time to restore errors. In contrast, alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide generate lethal DNA lesions even in resting cells by forming cross-links between DNA strands while ionising radiation exerts its main effect during mitosis. Various chemotherapeutic drugs such as adriamycin, bleomycin and 5-FU increase cellular sensitivity to radiation in a synergistic manner.28 This has also been observed clinically when idarubicin was given at the same time as cyclophosphamide and TBI.29",

Normally, these microorganisms contribute to maintaining the integrity of the integument and prevent pathogenic microbes from gaining a foothold. The ecological system tries to maintain its balance but once the mucosa is damaged, microbes may infect the submucosal tissue. Non-pathogenic streptococci specifically bind to, and use, the glycoproteins in the dental plaque that develops in the absence of normal food intake and saliva production. The non-cellular defence depends on amount and quality of mucus and saliva produced which contain diverse host defence peptides (defensins), lactoferrin, lysozyme and immunoglobulins.31 Secretory IgA inhibits bacterial adherence, specifically of oral streptococci, neutralises toxin and virus, prevents antigen uptake and possesses anti-inflammatory activity.32 Several classes of host defence peptides can be found in saliva and on surfaces each possessing rapid lytic activity against the membranes of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as yeasts.33 During conditioning therapy and after transplantation, the salivary immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM) have been shown to be lower than normal and the elimination of T cells from engrafted bone marrow results in less initial capacity for immunoglobulin production and secretion.34 Thus, the local immune defences of the oral cavity are impaired.",

This shift is more profound in patients with overt oral mucositis.35 There has also been a corresponding increase in bacteraemia due to these streptococci with oral mucositis being an important risk factor in autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.36 Similarly, Donnelly et al37 reported a higher incidence of viridans streptococcal bacteraemia due to the marked mucositis associated with treatment intensification. One particular species, Streptococcus mitis, is apparently associated with sepsis and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mainly after high-dose cytarabine.3839 This syndrome could be provoked by changes in the pulmonary endothelium and lung macrophages induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy which, in turn, induces cytokine production perhaps triggered by infection with Streptococcus mitis.40 The stomach or small intestine could also be a portal of entry if colonisation with these streptococci occurs as a result of the achlorhydria induced by H2 histamine antagonists and proton pump inhibitors since the use of these agents has been noted as a risk factor for the so-called \u2018alpha-strep syndrome\u2019.38 Obviously, MBI is itself a risk factor for viridans streptococcal bacteraemia but it might not always indicate systemic infection since transient bacteraemia also occurs in healthy persons after dental manipulation.41 Moreover, these bacteria do not elaborate exotoxins nor are they professional pathogens.

            "text": "Although, to some extent, similar to the oral cavity, the gut harbours a much more complex ecosystem comprising a greater variety of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that share a symbiotic relationship with the host. This relationship plays an important role in maintaining the gut's histological structure and also provides so-called \u2018colonisation resistance\u2019, ie the ability of the gut to repel foreign bacteria. The intestinal microflora depends on prebiotics, the fibrous nutrients42 that enhance probiotic bacteria, like bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and Clostridium species. These are the species that are thought to provide the colonisation resistance by elaborating antibacterial compounds and competing for nutrients so preventing overgrowth by potentially pathogenic bacteria.43 These probiotic bacteria also produce nutrients for mucosal cells. Certain antimicrobial agents, particularly those that affect cell wall synthesis, exert a major impact on the gut's ecosystem by destroying the \u2018protective\u2019 anaerobic flora particularly the probiotic bacteria. When the gut epithelium is disrupted, bacterial translocation occurs and pro-inflammatory bacterial oligopeptides, especially endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS) readily gain access.44 In the normal host (whether animal or human) pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa penetrate the mucosa and migrate to extra-intestinal sites such as the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and liver. The GALT system, together with the Kupffer cells of liver and spleen serve as a backup to trap endotoxins and kill bacteria. The rate of translocation of enterobacteria like E. coli and other gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa is strongly associated with the degree of neutropenia.45 Microbial translocation is exacerbated by irradiation46 and chemotherapy47 as microorganisms can be cultured in extra-intestinal sites as well as in blood.48 Different modes of translocation exist and occur even before any histological damage is apparent. Anaerobic non-pathogenic bacteria rarely translocate but yeasts such as Candida albicans can do so more easily when disruption has occurred.49 Endotoxin can be transported through the lymphatic channels, bypass the liver or enter the peritoneal cavity directly and can cause systemic endotoxaemia.50 Endotoxin can also increase intestinal permeability directly51 or by stimulating primed macrophages to release an excessive amount of cytokines, mostly TNF-\u03b1, thereby inducing mucosal inflammation and increasing permeability.52 Higher levels of circulating endotoxin are obtained after giving intensive TBI containing regimens13 suggesting that persistent low-grade endotoxaemia or the inflammation associated with MBI induce fever of unknown origin since endotoxaemia and gut mucosal damage occurred in 44 (70%) of 63 HSC transplant recipients (both allogeneic and autologous) all of whom developed fever that could not be explained by infection.53",

First, typhlitis occurs after the administration of cytotoxic drugs, particularly high-dose cytarabine, etoposide and anthracyclines at the nadir of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Secondly, prolonged exposure to antibiotics results in a marked shift in the gut microflora towards toxin producing bacteria55 such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium septicum.5657 In fact, Clostridium species are now more likely to predominate for reasons which are poorly understood so that bacteraemia due to C. tertium or C. septicum is almost pathognomonic for typhlitis. Antimicrobial pressure also predisposes to intestinal overgrowth by Clostridium difficile in transplant recipients.58 Necrosis of the mucosal surface of the ileocaecal region probably provides a favourable environment for the spores of Clostridium species to germinate and may be their portal of entry into the bloodstream. The pathogenesis of typhlitis would therefore seem to require various elements to be present simultaneously, namely gut MBI, a perturbed resident microflora and profound neutropenia. Typhlitis is not only a paradigm for MBI but, because of the high mortality rate, it is also the most severe clinical form of MBI and deserves more attention both in terms of developing techniques for early diagnosis as well as in evolving strategies for prevention and treatment. Consequently, we can expect to encounter more cases of typhlitis as chemotherapeutic regimens become more intense.",

The healing of mucosal damage probably occurs in two phases commencing with the restitution of mucosal integrity and then remodelling of the mucosal architecture. The mucosal repair process depends on the severity of damage since superficial injury can be repaired rapidly by epithelial cell migration without mitosis.61 However, proliferation in conjunction with angiogenesis is necessary for deep lesions, involving large areas of necrosis, to recover.62 Trefoil peptides (mucin-associated peptides) are secreted by epithelial cells, with each region of the gut probably having its own variant.62 These peptides act as rapid response molecules to injury by promoting cell migration, cell differentiation and wound healing.63 Epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, interleukin-11 and fibroblast growth factor also appear to promote epithelium repair and regeneration.64 In contrast, these agents appear to play only a limited role in the healing of the oral mucosa.",

For example, monosaccharides such as mannitol and rhamnose are absorbed through aqueous pores in the cell membrane whilst disaccharides like lactulose gain access through the tight junctions located at the upper end of adjacent epithelial cells. Tight junctions are dynamic structures exerting physiologic control over the flow of solutes through paracellular spaces and play an important role in gut permeability. Reduction of urinary monosaccharide excretion represents a loss of epithelial cell surface area, while increased urinary disaccharide excretion indicates damage to the tight junctions. Sugar absorption tests (SAT) have proved their value in intestinal diseases but they lack diagnostic specificity.75 SATs offer an easy, reliable means of assessing the onset, duration and severity of gut MBI in patients treated with cytotoxic agents. Absorption is increased after only 2 days treatment with chemotherapy76 suggesting that cytokines might interfere with the tight junctions (see inflammatory phase) rather than directly inhibiting cell proliferation, which tends to occur later.77 Altered permeability continues to progress until reaching a peak about 7 days after conditioning therapy has been completed78 and returns to normal about 4 weeks later.79 This mirrors the oral MBI and neutropenia (Figure 1).",

Malabsorption of D-xylose was also found to be an independent predictor of neutropenic enterocolitis and hepatosplenic candidosis and also correlated well with bacteraemia.8081 As yet, there are no objective means of determining gut MBI in use routinely and none has been validated for use in clinical trials to assess gut toxicity although the data available suggest SATs may be useful for helping adapt supportive care regimens for selected patients in order to reduce morbidity and perhaps mortality.",

Enough evidence exists to indicate that MBI is a complex and dynamic pathological process but it is essential to understand its nature more fully. A model for oral MBI already exists and shows that it is the net result of an almost complete breakdown of the epithelium initiated by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by the cytotoxic drugs followed by an arrest of the mucosal cell cycle and inhibition of repair leading to apoptosis. Infection, if it plays any role at all, is largely secondary. This model may go some way to explain the corresponding phenomenona in the gut although gut MBI is likely to be much more complex and more difficult to unravel mainly because the damage cannot be seen and the signs and symptoms are too imprecise.",

The first phase is the inflammatory/vascular phase and is characterised by the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma by cytotoxic drugs and irradiation while the epithelial cells are still intact. The second phase is the epithelial phase when cells cease dividing and die. This coincides with neutropenia. The third phase is when necrosis and ulceration occur and is when the resident microbial flora and their products, eg endotoxin translocate into the bloodstream. Moreover, impaired local defences and lower levels of secretory IgA may allow local infection to develop. The final phase is when healing takes place and involves the action of naturally occurring substances including trefoils, EGF and TGF. The events that take place in the gut are almost certainly more complicated than those occurring in the oral cavity since the gastrointestinal tract is intrinsically more complex in terms of its function, it possesses the specialised gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) system, and its resident microflora are more numerous and varied.",
