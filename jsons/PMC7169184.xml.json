The CEM regimen consists of carboplatin (300 mg/m2 for 4 days), etoposide (200 mg/m2 for 4 days) and melphalan (140 mg/m2 for 1 day and 70 mg/m2 for 1 day). The CECy regimen includes carboplatin (650 mg/m2 for 3 days), etoposide (650 mg/m2 for 3 days) and cyclophosphamide (1800 mg/m2 for 3 days with 2\u2010mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium). Carboplatin (250 mg/m2 for 3 days), thiotepa (200 mg/m2 for 3 days) and melphalan (160 mg/m2 for 1 day) make up the CTM regimen.

The dosages of other HDCT regimens are similar to the dosage of chemotherapeutic agents stated earlier, except for some modifications. TBI was delivered in fractioned doses (333 cGy/fraction, 3 fractions).

MIBG shares the same uptake and release mechanism as norepinephrine, and it is used for the detection of neuroendocrine tumours or targeted radiotherapy for advanced neuroblastoma.32, 33\n123I\u2010MIBG is also taken up by the lung through energy\u2010requiring, sodium\u2010dependent transport mechanism, so MIBG scintigraphy is used to assess pulmonary endothelial cell injury.34 In 131I MIBG mega\u2010therapy groups, transient interstitial pneumonia and fatal pneumonia were reported, but the risk of pulmonary complications warrants further investigation. Even though gender was a risk factor in this study, the specific mechanism for this trend is not known. Gender\u2010based differences in bleomycin\u2010induced pulmonary fibrosis have been reported in an animal study.35 Male gender was also determined to be a risk factor for ILD in non\u2010small\u2010cell lung cancer patients who received gefitinib treatment.36 The gender effect of the development of ILD after autologous HSCT needs to be studied. Total body irradiation (TBI, >1200 cGy) among patients older than 40 years is also known to produce a high risk for IPS.22 However, TBI was not associated with ILD in this study, which may have been due to the young age of our patients or the lower dose of TBI (333 cGy/fraction, 3 fractions) that was used. Bleomycin and methotrexate, which are both drugs that are known to cause ILD,14 were used at conventional chemotherapy doses in this study group, but they had no significant association with noninfectious ILD.",
