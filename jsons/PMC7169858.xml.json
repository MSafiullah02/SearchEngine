The first case with typical symptoms of SARS emerged in Foshan municipality, Guangdong Province, China, with the onset date of 16 November 2002 (Zhong & Zeng 2005). Five index cases were reported in Foshan, Zhongshan, Jiangmen, Guangzhou and Shenzhen municipalities of Guangdong province before January 2003. The early\u2010stage outbreak of SARS in Guangdong province was sporadic and apparently not associated with the index cases (He et al. 2003). By January 2003, SARS had become a large\u2010scale outbreak in Guangdong Province (Zhao et al. 2003), and after February 2003, it had appeared in Hong Kong (Lee et al. 2003) and seven other provinces: Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Zhejiang, Sichuan and Shanxi (Xu et al. 2004). Some cases from Shanxi province and Hong Kong were imported to Beijing and transmission from index cases was amplified within several health care facilities by March (Liang et al. 2004b). Soon Beijing became the epicentre of the SARS outbreak and endangered various other provinces or cities of mainland China. At the same time, Singapore, Canada, USA and Vietnam were involved in the worldwide spread through imported cases from Hong Kong (Tsang et al. 2003). By the end of the SARS epidemic in 2003, 32 countries had reported SARS cases.",

Three days later, WHO gave an emergency travel advisory (WHO 2003f). On 24 March, WHO described the clinical features of SARS, which were revised on 1 May 2003 (WHO 2003e, 2003g). A novel coronavirus, named SARS\u2010CoV, was identified as the infectious agent responsible for SARS in April 2003 (Drosten et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003; Peiris et al. 2003). In total, 8437 probable SARS cases, of whom 813 had died, were reported during the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003. Mainland China was by far the most seriously affected area, reporting 5327 probable SARS cases of whom 348 died, between 16 November 2002 and 11 June 2003 (WHO 2003a).",

As a result of initial lack of awareness of SARS by health workers, the disease spread unnoticed at the early stage of the epidemic (Zhang 2003), which was unduly prolonged by limited information transfer (Zheng 2003). At the time, a functional infectious diseases surveillance system was not yet available, and the reporting system was outdated, hampering data collection and delaying interventions (Ma et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2003; An et al. 2004; Lv et al. 2004; Pan 2004). The absence of reliable serological diagnostics (Fang et al. 2003), and changes in the clinical definition of SARS during the epidemic (Abdullah et al. 2003; CDC 2003a, 2003b, 2003c, 2003d, 2003e, 2003f, 2004) made misreporting inevitable and complicated the study of the dynamics of the epidemic (Shi et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2005). In summary, in mainland China, data collection and data analysis were extremely difficult when compared with other affected areas, which explains why the epidemiological characteristics of the SARS outbreak in China have not been published in a comprehensive epidemiological account so far.",

According to the Law of Prevention of Infectious Diseases of mainland China, there are 35 notifiable infectious diseases, divided into three classes, i.e. classes A, B, and C. Of these, 27 must be reported. For example, if local hospitals found cases of plague or cholera (both class A), or AIDS or pulmonary anthrax (both class B), they had to inform the district/county CDC and local HD by telephone within 6 h in urban and within 12 h in rural areas and complete the reporting form for infectious diseases immediately. Then, the district/county CDC investigated the case at once, notified the provincial/city CDC and concurrently forwarded the information to the local HD (PRC 1989). Forms reporting cases of infectious diseases were sent or mailed to the district/county CDC. After integration of all data from the whole district/county, summary data of infectious diseases were sent to the provincial CDC and district/county every month. In the same way, summary data integrated by provincial CDC were sent to the national CDC and to the same level HD. (Figure 1). The military reporting system of infectious diseases was similar to the national reporting system, but supervised by the Military CDC, and did not link up regularly with the national reporting system of infectious diseases. Only on special occasions such as major outbreaks, interaction occurred at the highest level.",

Guangdong provincial CDC established their own database for data collection of SARS on 3 February 2003 (Fang et al. 2003). Two cases reported in Foshan (16 November) and Heyuan (15 December 2002) were included retrospectively in this database, together with cases reported after 2 January 2003. The database included cases matching the definition of unexplained pneumonia (the name later changed to atypical pneumonia and then to SARS) and identified during the course of case investigations or after voluntary reporting by clinicians (PRC 2003). At the second stage, from 8\u201326 April 2003, the district/county CDC was ordered to submit summary data of SARS cases daily to the national CDC, level by level, as SARS had become a new notifiable infectious disease as a result of a revision of the Law of Prevention of Infectious Diseases. During the third stage, from 26 April to 16 May 2003, individual cases had to be reported to the national CDC daily. At the fourth stage, from 16 May to the end of SARS epidemic, county CDCs could enter SARS data into a national database with a special network reporting system for SARS data collection established on 16 May (Xu et al. 2003).",

The quality of data collection plays an important role in the process of infectious diseases control and prevention (Pan 2004). The national infectious disease reporting system, which covered all levels of CDCs based on a network for reporting data of notifiable infectious disease by month, could not meet the need of daily data collection in emergency situations. At the time, rather than a surveillance system for new and existing infectious diseases, it was a data management system for existing ones (Pan 2004). The system could not detect emerging infectious diseases as it did not possess a monitoring and alert function. There was also a lack of coordination and collaboration among fragmented governmental HDs. Furthermore, the hospital information system is independent of the infectious disease management system and the data of infectious disease reported by level. Thus, information on the SARS epidemic was not exchanged and the chance missed to detect the outbreak early and to put in place adequate control measures (Pan 2004). Finally, there was a lack of reflection on the information about cases, which could not be modified over time by local CDCs, once the cases were submitted to be included in the national database (Tang et al. 2003; 2004a, 2004b;Xie et al. 2005).",

The first clinical criterion of probable SARS was mainly used for diagnosis for the cases in Guangdong province until 31 January 2003. It was based on symptoms and signs of febrile respiratory illness, decreased white blood cells, abnormal chest X\u2010ray, close contact with SARS cases, being a member of an infectious cluster, having infected another person, or failed antibiotic treatment within 72 h. Data of probable cases during that time were collected retrospectively (PRC 2003).

Most of the SARS cases in the various databases are probable cases as diagnosed by the SARS clinical criterion of the Chinese Ministry of Health, WHO, United States CDC, and Hong Kong since. Clinical diagnosis was the only means to recognise SARS, because reliable serological detection methods for SARS did not yet exist. Misdiagnosis or overdiagnosis may have resulted from limited knowledge about SARS, especially early in the epidemic, from the often mild clinical appearance of cases, and from the old age of some cases, usually combined with chronic disease (Anonymous 2003c; 2003a, 2004a, 2004b, 2005;Liang et al. 2004a; Shi et al. 2004; Wu et al. 2004; Che et al. 2006; Si et al. 2006).",

Furthermore, more intense treatment with steroids, possibly in combination with traditional medicine, may have reduced the CFR in mainland China (Anonymous 2003b; Lew et al. 2003; Li et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2003b; Wang et al. 2003; Zhong 2003).

First, an effective national integrated data reporting system is the foundation of a public health system. Such systems did exist for infectious and occupational diseases and food or environmental poisoning (An et al. 2004). But, data were still submitted by telephone level\u2010by\u2010level, without feedback and evaluation of the quality of reported data, and possible missing or duplicated cases. Neither did those systems involve information of clinical case tracing or results of laboratory tests. Efficient surveillance for infectious diseases should link clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data on cases and to disseminate this information locally, nationally and globally. It also must allow for rapid identification, tracking, evaluation and monitoring of contacts of cases (Parashar & Anderson 2004). After SARS, a project for sharing scientific data of mainland China was funded (Lu et al. 2004).",

Failure to immediately control the SARS epidemic was partly because of the absence of an efficient emergency monitoring system (Huang 2003; Xing & Zhang 2003). A survey conducted by the CDC in US showed that an effective surveillance system is a vital part of any public health system and should support the implementation of effective infectious disease control measures. The National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) of the United States is a standardisation and integration information system for infectious disease monitoring. With this system, professionals can share their data in different areas (Anonymous 2001; Mokdad et al. 2003). Confronted by the West Nile outbreak in 1999, the government of the United States established the symptom surveillance system, which was operational by 2000. The application of the system in the control of SARS proved to be efficient (O\u2019Hara 2001). A nationwide monitoring system for emerging infectious diseases has been set up in mainland China. Surveillance of 185 designated hospitals and a network of 39 laboratories had soon thereafter resulted in the identification of 16 cases of human avian flu (Zhong et al. 2003).",
