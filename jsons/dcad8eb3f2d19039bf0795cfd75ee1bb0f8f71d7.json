            "text": "The rationale for the use of interferon (IFN) in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) is based on its recognized antiviral and irnmunomodulating actions. The pathogenesis of MS is believed to be due to an immunologic response in a genetically predisposed individual, localized within the central nervous system white matter, and triggered by exposure to an environmental agent such as a virus. Based on our personal experience we find that the efficacy of IFN therapy is hampered in MS patients by the presence of an interferon inhibitor factor (IIF) in the patients' sera which we have isolated and characterized. When plasmapheresis (PP) was done on 24 MS patients with intermittent 3-day administration of IFN-a and human leukocyte IFN, marked increase of IFN in 18 patients and modest increase in three patients correlated with clinical improvement. Three clinical nonresponders showed no increase in IFN levels following therapy. The ability to remove IIF and lymphokine inhibitor factor (LIF) by PP may explain the successful treatment of our patients. We describe the evaluation of helper T cells, suppressor T cells, HLADR antigen, natural killer cells, and monocyteimacrophage cell populations by flow cytometry before and after PP. A significant increase in these immune-competent cells correlated with marked improvement in Kurtzke disability status scale in 13 patients, while eight stabilized. Patients showing progression of the disease either showed decrease or no change in these parameters after therapy. Encouraging results from this pilot study suggest that PP combined with immunomodulatory regimens of IFN may be an effective therapy for MS.",

Many of these cells so activated are then directly cytotoxic. While antibody recognizes tertiary surface structures of molecules and require complement activation with K effector cells to achieve cell lysis 151, cytotoxic cells attach to a membrane receptor in a calcium-independent step, releasing proteolytic enzymes to induce cell lysis [6] . This is associated with increased cytokine production. Lymphocyte activation is cytokine dependent. Protein kinase C , which is also activated [7] , initiates cell proliferation and further expression of MHC gene products. Interleukin 2 produced in such activation sustains the response and serves to distribute receptor from cytosol to membrane to permit expansion of the process [8] . Interferon-? is similarly associated with enhanced expression of MHC class I1 gene products and acts in synergy with interferon-a 191. Interferon-a, in contrast, downregulates B-cell antibody synthesis but enhances CD8 cytotoxic cell expression [lo] . Protein kinase C production can be bypassed by both growth factors and continued mitogenic stimulus with activation of gene sequences leading to further clonal expansion of involved cells [ 1 I]. Octreide can block the process [ 121.",

In fact, decrease in dimension of some peracute plaques was observed in some patients, but this probably can be attributed to regression of periplaque edema (data not shown). These patients received four courses of treatments each. Common to responders was a dramatic fall in circulating IIF and/or lymphokine inhibitor levels (mean fall 70%).

Because immunologic studies have suggested both a \"hyperactive\" and a defective immune response in patients with MS [3 I], experimental treatment regimens designed either to suppress [32] or to enhance [33] the immune response have been attempted. PP in conjunction with immunosuppressive drugs may be an effective therapy in MS [341. This study of high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide, plasma exchange, and ACTH suggests that the intensive immunosllppression regimen was more effective in halting progression of the disease at both 6 and 12 months. A double-blind controlled study [35] showed PP to be significantly ( P < ,007) effective in delaying the progression of the disease in patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis taking immunosuppressive drugs. Also in the Canadian trial [36] , at 12, 18, and 24 month assessment, the patients showing stabilization or improvement was greater in the PP group than in other groups. Why PP works in MS is not entirely clear. The rationale for doing PP in MS includes changes in T-cell regulation, presence of immunoglobulin in the cerebrospinal fluid, and a profound lymphocyte infiltrate in the active MS lesion. Our study shows for the first time a correlation between improvement in serum IFN levels following removal of circulating IIF by PP in MS patients. Increased serum IFN levels correlated with clinical improvement.",
