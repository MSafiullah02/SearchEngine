            "text": "Purpose of review This narrative review seeks to ascertain the challenges older patients face with participation in mental health clinical research studies and suggests creative strategies to minimize these obstacles. Recent findings Challenges to older adults' engagement in mental health research include practical, institutional, and collaboration-related barriers applicable to all clinical trials as well as more personal, cultural, and age-related patient barriers specific to geriatric mental health research. Universal research challenges include (1) institutional barriers of lack of funding and researchers, inter-researcher conflict, and sampling bias; (2) collaborationrelated barriers involving miscommunication and clinician concerns; and (3) practical patient barriers such as scheduling issues, financial constraints, and transportation difficulties. Challenges unique to geriatric mental health research include (1) personal barriers such as no perceived need for treatment, prior negative experience, and mistrust of mental health research; (2) cultural barriers involving stigma and lack of bilingual or culturally matched staff; and (3) chronic medical issues and concerns about capacity. Summary Proposed solutions to these barriers include increased programmatic focus on and funding of geriatric psychiatry research grants, meeting with clinical staff to clarify study protocols and eligibility criteria, and offering transportation for participants. To minimize stigma and mistrust of psychiatric research, studies should devise community outreach efforts, employ culturally competent bilingual staff, and provide patient and family education about the study and general information about promoting mental health.",

Consequences include increased costs and efforts, reduced statistical power of studies, and delays in generating evidence and subsequent adoption of effective interventions [9] . The purpose of this paper is to (1) describe identified barriers to older adult participation in clinical research and (2) recommend possible solutions to minimize these barriers that should be considered by clinical researchers as they develop projects. While the literature has been reviewed for barriers against recruitment for mental health studies pertaining to all ages [9] [10] [11] , to our knowledge, there has been no review of barriers to recruitment and retention for geriatric mental health research. This narrative review will summarize findings from original studies and others to concisely present barriers for older adults and our proposed solutions to advance the field.",

Older adults who do not respond to recruitment efforts and survey studies or who tend to drop out of longitudinal studies differ from those who respond or continue. Recruitment non-responders/dropouts tend to have worse physical health and greater disabilities, report less physical activity, have fewer social contacts, lower education, poorer verbal skills, lower general intelligence, and be of lower socioeconomic class than respondents and those who complete studies [39] . As such, mental health studies unintentionally exclude more mentally ill patients who, due to the nature of their illness, are less likely to participate. This underrepresentation of a subset of mentally ill patients may lead to researchers overlooking or underestimating important correlates of mental illness. This phenomenon is commonly observed with depression, in which depression-associated ambivalence about joining a clinical trial, even if associated risks are minimal, limits participation. Depressed older adults are more likely than middle-aged and younger depressed adults to [39] . Patients with cognitive impairment, highly prevalent in depression, may further limit participation due to reduced decision-making capacity necessary to provide informed consent [40] . Thus, the nature of the mental illness itself may result in sampling bias and inaccurate representation of the disease being studied, an inherent challenge to clinical trials with this population.",

They describe concerns about loss of autonomy over the patient's care, how research will affect the doctor-patient relationship, and potential side effects, and the burden of research, especially for very old or severely ill patients [48, 49] . While these decisions are motivated by caring, this overprotectiveness of patients leads some physicians to assume decisionmaking on behalf of some patients who may have been eligible and interested in participating [45, 50, 51] .

At the time of preparing this manuscript, efforts to mitigate the Coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020 include self-isolation and avoiding health care centers which contain a higher density of symptomatic patients and are often the same locations where clinical research is conducted [52] . Although not further discussed in this manuscript, these mitigation efforts are currently an obstacle to ongoing clinical trials, and funders and researchers are rapidly developing and adopting clinical procedures that may be conducted remotely to minimize the impact on clinical research of these contagion mitigation strategies.",

Additionally, as caregivers of older adults often experience elevated stress, anxiety, and depression, researchers should inquire about the mental health status of caregivers and provide appropriate resources [28] . Addressing caregiver mental health concerns enables them to better perform their responsibilities as a caregiver and may improve their overall attitude towards mental health and the research process. An interventional study offering psychoeducational workshops to families of older patients with depression supports this theory, noting a lower rate of dropout during continuation of treatment and suggesting that \"psychoeducation and support may be especially important for families of elderly patients with depression who may be faced with an increase in an already substantial caretaking burden.\" [70] Community outreach efforts to establish relationships with geriatric and older adult minority communities can help promote positive perceptions about mental health treatment and research. Sponsoring community events and lectures, serving as guest expert on radio programs, and providing written and durable electronic information materials about mental health and research at senior centers, churches, and other community centers can establish the presence of researchers in the community, remove the mystery surrounding research to make it seem more like an opportunity, and provide a forum for older adults to ask questions about research methods and ethics [33] . Research advocacy training programs for older adults increase the likelihood of participation in research and advocating for future studies [71] . As the majority of elderly persons receiving mental health care are treated by their general medical providers, it is essential to teach basic geriatric mental health skills to current and future primary care providers as well [16] . Dowrick et al. (2016) implemented an interventional study linking primary care training with community engagement in an Improving Access to Mental Health in Primary Care (AMP) model that also incorporated a wellbeing intervention based on cognitive-behavioral principles. They found that community engagement (including housing associations, faith leaders, police, business leaders, and health practitioners) raised awareness of mental health issues and increased referrals to the wellbeing intervention, while recruitment was positively associated with offering training to primary care providers [72] . Kogan et al. (2009) also emphasize the importance of including community partners from the outset in the process of research development and implementation with involving minority groups in bipolar disorder research, noting 45% enrollment from minority populations at community sites compared with 15% at academic sites [73] . The few studies exploring specific interventions to increase participation in mental health research illustrate success with implementing community outreach and primary care training efforts, but these studies are limited and demonstrate the need for additional interventional research to guide how researchers approach recruitment for mental health studies in the future.",

Specific strategies include increasing PCP knowledge about available studies and improved integration with psychiatric services; community outreach through community events and both traditional and social media; having culturally competent and bilingual members of research staff; and providing both patient and family/caregiver education about mental health conditions and the purpose and procedures of the studies to assure families support the participation of their older relatives.",
