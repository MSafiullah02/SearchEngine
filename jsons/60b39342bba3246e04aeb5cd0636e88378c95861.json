The control takes the form of a multiplicative reduction in the contact rate of infectious individuals. The control is allowed to be applied only over a finite time interval, while the objective is to minimize the total number of individuals infected in the long-time limit, subject to some cost function for the control. We first consider the no-cost scenario and analytically determine the optimal control and solution. We then study solutions when a cost of intervention is included, as well as a cost associated with overwhelming the available medical resources. Examples are studied through the numerical solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Finally, we provide some examples related directly to the current pandemic.",

If this condition is not satisfied at the initial time, then y(t) will first increase until it is, and then decrease, approaching zero asymptotically. The SIR model assumes that recovery confers permanent immunity. For many diseases affecting humans, herd immunity is achieved through vaccination of a sufficient portion of the population. Herein we assume a vaccine is unavailable, so that herd immunity can only be achieved through infection and recovery. Our goal is to minimize z \u221e := lim t\u2192\u221e z(t), or equivalently (since y \u221e = 0) to maximize the long-time limit of the susceptible fraction: x \u221e = lim t\u2192\u221e x(t). This has the effect of minimizing the number of eventual deaths, which would be proportional to z \u221e . This is equivalent to minimizing the number of deaths, if we assume that some fixed fraction of the recovered population z(t) dies from the disease. From the foregoing it is clear that x \u221e \u2264 1/\u03c3 0 . The difference 1/\u03c3 0 \u2212x \u221e is referred to as epidemiological overshoot. For COVID-19, a review of early estimates of \u03c3 0 can be found in [16, Table 1 ], with mean 3.28 and median 2.79. In accordance with these estimates, we use a value \u03c3 0 = 3 in most of the examples in this work. With this value, the SIR model implies that eventually at least two-thirds of the world population will eventually have COVID-19 antibodies; this number is likely to be significantly higher in reality due to epidemiological overshoot. For instance, it can be seen from Figure 1 (a) that, starting from a fully susceptible population and a small number of infected individuals, in the absence of control the SIR model predicts that over 90% of the population would be infected.",

Similarly, we see from (2) that the optimal control gives y(T ) = e \u2212\u03b3T y 0 and any other control will lead to a larger value of y(T ). Since x \u221e is a decreasing function of y and (for x < 1/\u03c3 0 ) an increasing function of x, the proposed control is optimal in this case. Now suppose x(0) > 1/\u03c3 0 . We reformulate the objective as follows. From (7) we see that x \u221e is a strictly monotone increasing function of \u00b5, so that maximizing x \u221e is equivalent to maximizing \u00b5. Now \u00b5 (t) = (x (t) \u2212 \u03c3 0 x(t)(x (t) + y (t)))e \u2212\u03c3 0 (x(t)+y(t)) = (\u03c3 0 \u2212 \u03c3(t))\u03b3x(t)y(t)e \u2212\u03c3 0 (x(t)+y(t)) = \u03b3y(t)(\u03c3 0 \u2212 \u03c3(t))\u00b5(t).",

Again, we choose parameter values that demonstrate the range of qualitative behaviors. In both examples, the cost of control is scaled by c 2 = 10 \u22123 . In Figure 8 , a higher cost for hospital overflow is applied, with c 3 = 10. As might be expected, y(t) is generally kept below y max (which is set to 0.1). The control is initially off, then turns on to avoid hospital overflow, and then turns off again. While the control is applied, it is maintained at a level that keeps the value of y(t) nearly constant in time. Figure 9 shows another example scenario in which the cost of hospital overflow is smaller, with c 3 = 1.

We now present a brief illustration of the results in practical terms through application to the current COVID-19 pandemic. This application is imprecise, for several reasons: the SIR model is one of the simplest epidemiological models, and assumes homogeneous mixing among a population; the current state of susceptible and infected persons is not accurately known; and the parameters of the disease itself (i.e. \u03b3, \u03c3 0 ) are still quite uncertain. The examples in this section should be viewed only as illustrations of a few possible scenarios, and not an exhaustive or detailed study. We take the infectious period \u03b3 \u22121 = 10 days, and the basic reproduction number \u03c3 0 = 2.5, based on recent estimates [23, 16] . To make the results easy to interpret, we use a fixed terminal cost of c 1 z \u221e , where we have introduced an additional scaling constant. Taking c 1 = \u03b1N , where N is the total population being modeled and \u03b1 is the infection fatality ratio, then this cost is the expected number of lives lost. Since z \u221e = 1 \u2212 x \u221e , this is merely a rescaling of the terminal cost used throughout this work. We take \u03b1 \u2248 0.006 based on recent estimates [23, 19, 24] .",

Whether we consider the value of a human life to be in intrinsic personal value or extrinsic economic value, we can view the cost of intervention as a reduction of the value of human lives during the intervention period. We take c 2 = N /d where d \u2248 10 4 is the number of days in a human life (more precisely, the average number of days remaining in a life claimed by the disease) and 1 \u2212 is the relative value of a day spent in full isolation (\u03c3 = 0) compared to a day without intervention. Taking = 0.2, we have c 2 = 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 N . Since all terms in the cost function are proportional to N , we take N = 1 without loss of generality. Results for the parameter values given above are shown in Figure  10 . We see that the optimal control corresponds to a level of intervention that becomes more strict as the epidemic grows, and is gradually relaxed as the epidemic subsides. Most importantly, and in agreement with results from the examples in earlier sections, the strongest control is applied around the time of peak infection and shortly thereafter. The maximum hospital capacity is significantly exceeded, with the maximum value of y around 0.08. It seems plausible that this level of infection may still be manageable with local surges of care facilities and staff, like those that have already been carried out in practice for COVID-19.
