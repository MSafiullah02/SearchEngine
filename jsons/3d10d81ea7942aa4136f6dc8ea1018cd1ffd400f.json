            "text": "As with many ageing nations, residential long term care in Singapore has become a pragmatic option for older persons who, for various reasons, cannot receive care appropriate for their needs at home. To meet this challenge, a comprehensive Healthcare Masterplan 2012-2020 has been progressively implemented in Singapore over the last decade with the endeavour to double the capacity of NHs (6) . Besides accelerating the number of new and larger NHs, which grew from 64 in 2012 to 77 in 2019, there is also a desire to make a gradual transition from an institutional to a more home-like and person centric care model to better meet the needs of future cohorts of increasingly educated seniors who value greater privacy and autonomy. It is noteworthy that the recent guidelines (7-9) on coping with COVID-19 in long term care can have bearings on person centred care (10) (PCC) and the converse applies likewise.",

Single rooms are few and meant for immuno-compromised residents or isolation of those with infectious diseases. Single rooms housed within small and home-like environments, which afford greater privacy, freedom and personalisation of space, is aligned with PCC and have been evidenced to be associated with less agitation, and better mood and sleeping patterns in people with dementia (11) . PCC also promotes autonomy where residents are self-caring as far as possible and encouraged to engage in higher order tasks to maintain a sense of meaning and purpose, and to optimize functional capabilities. Having more independent residents is advantageous during a pandemic given the need for isolation and safe distancing, with decreased staff-resident contact time. These measures for infection control can conceivably be continued beyond the pandemic in the form of single rooms to secure an enhanced living ambience for the residents and respects their right to individuality and selfdetermination.",

            "text": "A dormitory-like living arrangement, with frequent staff movement between shifts and wards, can promote depersonalised care as staff have less opportunities to acquaint themselves well with the residents and build relationships. These relatively more expansive living spaces with limited staffing often prioritise safety above autonomy whereby frail residents who attempt to get out of bed on their own are restrained to prevent falls. In contrast, small and homelike environments, with consistent staff caring for the same residents, help to promote closeness and nurture relationships which are fundamental to the wellbeing of both residents and staff. Moreover, having the same staff care for a smaller group of residents has the advantage of reducing the risk of cross-infection during an outbreak. The intimacy and trust developed over time also lends itself more expediently to honest conversations on which advance care plans are founded. Making advance care plans is pertinent in the face of a pandemic like COVID-19 (12) which preferentially increases mortality in frail nursing home residents. A 90 year old woman from Belgium made the decision to refuse ventilator treatment during the current pandemic, saying \"Keep this for the younger patients, I have had a beautiful life\" (13) .",

            "text": "Regular human interaction and engagement are crucial to PCC. This becomes highly challenging to fulfil with the need for physical distancing and infection control. COVID-19 has seen the application of several available technologies. Likewise, technologies can be relevant in long term care and especially useful in a pandemic. Autonomous robots have been deployed in COVID-19 isolation rooms to deliver meals and medication, monitor vital signs and act as portals of communication between staff and patients (14) . If single rooms for PCC are advocated, these robots can be adopted and the residents given time to familiarise so that even those with dementia will not be averse to interacting with them. The digital interface, delivered through robots or video conferencing, can also prompt reminders for daily activities, engage residents in therapy and interactive games, and provide opportunities for conversations with staff, family and friends. Hence, pre-emptive adoption of technology in long term care can ease transition into more technology enabled care during pandemic times. Conversely, the uptake of technology during a pandemic can also facilitate more sustainable use of technology beyond the pandemic.",
