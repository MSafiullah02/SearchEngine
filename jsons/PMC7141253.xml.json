So every sector and every individual must be involved in the fights,\u201d [1]. In the absence of a vaccine, tools such as isolation and quarantine, social distancing, and community containment become vital in preventing the person-to-person spread of disease by separating people to interrupt transmission [2]. COVID-19 statistics for South Africa show that, as of March 30, 2020, there were 1326 cases in South Africa with 324 reported cases in the Western Cape Province with a total of 3 deaths in the country [3]. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a nationwide lockdown for 21 days effective at midnight on March 26, 2020 [4]. This paper was first published online prior to this announcement; however, the method and results can be interpreted in light of the lockdown decision and can be used to guide any easing of restrictions going forward.",

Cape Town, the capital city of the Western Cape Province with an estimated population of 4 million, is South Africa\u2019s second most populous city after Johannesburg and Africa\u2019s 10th most populous city [6]. Cape Town has not been immune to the rise of urbanization, and migration to the city has led to the establishment of many informal settlements. Housing in informal settlements is unregulated by the state, planned by local communities, and typically constructed in a haphazard fashion using cheap and recycled building materials. Due to competition for space, homes can be built close together with only narrow access paths. Some settlements are less densely constructed, but these tend to be the newer settlements located further away from the city in locations where there is little economic opportunity. There are an estimated 146,000 households living in informal settlements in Cape Town, many of which are not recognized as permanent, with the residents lacking occupation rights and security of tenure [7]. It is further estimated that only one-third of the toilets in Cape Town\u2019s informal settlements are permanent infrastructure with the rest being temporary toilets that are provided and cleaned by private companies [7]. Other challenges include the particularly high HIV burden borne by residents of informal settlements in comparison to other settlement types [8]. Although there is no evidence that the risk of infection or complications of COVID-19 are different amongst people living with HIV when compared with the general population, people living with advanced HIV disease and who are not taking antiretroviral treatment are at an increased risk of infections, in general [9].",

Furthermore, it has been proposed that social distancing be implemented in a rationally layered manner to protect individuals with a higher risk of mortality [10]. Should social distancing measures not be effective, the next stage, known as community containment, may need to be implemented. This involves reduction of personal interaction at the community level, which is ethically more challenging, and its implementation requires close partnership and cooperation with law enforcement [2].",

Due to the density of dwellings in informal settlements, effectively implementing social distancing may be a challenge. The objective of this paper is to determine if social distancing measures are achievable in informal settlements in Cape Town using two settlements as an example. First, we examined the distance between dwellings and their first, second, and third nearest neighbors. Second, we identified clusters of dwellings in which residents would be unable to effectively practice social isolation due to the close proximity of their homes. It should be noted that this study is based solely on one data set (the outline of informal dwellings), and it is envisaged that public health scientists could incorporate this data set as one of many parameters in specific risk modelling, should it prove useful. Vulnerability mapping of COVID-19 in the South African context, which considers factors other than distances between dwellings, has been written for the Gauteng Province [11] and could similarly be applied elsewhere in South Africa.",

In particular, it looks at the layout of the settlements with respect to the distance between dwellings and their nearest neighbors to determine if a social distancing approach is feasible in these environments. The assumption was made that all outer boundaries of a dwelling are a potential zone of transmission. It is likely that the risk of transmission will be higher at openings such as doors and windows; however, in the absence of these data, all boundaries of a dwelling were treated equally.",

The proximity tool \u201cGenerate Near Table\u201d was then used to calculate the distance to each dwelling\u2019s first, second, and third nearest neighbors.

If such a measure was to be implemented in Cape Town, using the dwelling data set, it is possible to identify clusters of homes that are unable to effectively self-isolate due to their proximity to neighbors (ie, a person who leaves their home will immediately be within 2 m of another home and may either spread or become infected by the virus). This would be exacerbated if more than one person in a cluster was outside their home at the same time. Taking the dwellings\u2019 outline data set in ArcGIS 10.5.1, the proximity tool \u201cBuffer\u201d was used to expand the outline of individual dwellings by 1 m. Thus, if two dwellings are within 2 m of each other, their buffers intersect and a single polygon grouping of these dwellings is drawn. This is illustrated in Figure 2 where each color represents the groupings of dwellings that would have to self-isolate together, as individual self-isolation would likely be ineffective.",

The normalized distribution graphs (Figures 3 and 4) seem to show that Masiphumelele posed a higher risk with respect to the nearest neighbors than Klipfontein Glebe; however, the box and whisker chart in Figure 7 together with the descriptive statistics (Table 1) appear to paint a somewhat different picture. Klipfontein Glebe has the larger maximum cluster size and the larger median with a smaller standard deviation. However, the presence of some large clusters within the Masiphumelele data set, together with the lower count, result in a higher mean in Masiphumelele.",

To effectively maintain social distancing, residents would, in effect, be unable to leave their homes. This is impractical, given that many homes are not serviced and lack toilets and running water. Even in the case of a complete lockdown (as is currently underway), residents would be asked to do the impossible, as they would be unable to leave their homes to access toilets and water while maintaining a safe 2-m separation distance. In addition, the living conditions inside homes are generally cramped and overcrowded with inadequate insulation, making staying indoors unbearably uncomfortable, particularly on hot days. Given the results of this paper, when implementing lockdowns, the authorities may need to take a more nuanced approach and consider implementing shut down at the community level, rather than at the household level.",

The first, second, and third nearest neighbors peak at approximately 0.5 m, 1.0 m, and 1.5 m, respectively, for Masiphumelele, and approximately 0.7 m, 1.4 m, and 2 m, respectively, for Klipfontein Glebe.

Furthermore, these communal points will themselves be locations for potential disease spread, and, much like John Snow\u2019s original research on epidemiology in 1854 [14], actions to prevent disease spread at these locations should be taken (although different from those implemented by Snow). Analysis of these data, if they indeed exist, should occur in parallel and in combination with the work presented here. Furthermore, it is reiterated that this method alone does not represent the entire picture of vulnerability to COVID-19 transmission in Cape Town informal settlements.",

Thus, containment of the spread of COVID-19 in Cape Town to prevent it reaching the informal settlements is likely to be a key consideration for authorities and decision makers. This will hold true for many other cities within Africa and the developing world, in general. However, data on informal settlements at the level that has been presented here is lacking in most, if not all, cities. Should the method presented here be deemed useful to decision makers, a mobilization of volunteer GISs as well as a machine learning approach would be proposed to produce the data required in the shortest a time period possible.",
