            "text": "Unassisted spontaneous ventilation (SV) had been the conventional mode of ventilation with supraglottic airway devices (SAD) for ambulatory surgical practices. Nevertheless, the use of SV in longer surgeries is limited by inadequate ventilation, ineffective gaseous exchange, and fatigue resulting in hypoventilation. 1 The advent of second-generation SADs like the LMA Proseal TM (Teleflex Medical, Morrisville, NC, USA) with higher sealing pressure and inbuilt gastric channel significantly increased the use of positive-pressure ventilation with SADs. 2 As a result, the use of these SADs with pressure control ventilation (PCV) mode was compatible with longer surgeries, overcoming the limitations of SV. [3] [4] [5] Pressure support ventilation (PSV), initially used for weaning patients from ventilator support in the intensive care unit, has now been incorporated in the newer workstations in the operating theatre. 6 It is a type of SV mode that senses the patient's inspiratory effort and delivers pressure support to overcome the resistance of the machine, breathing circuit, and airway device resulting in larger tidal volume than the patient could produce alone. 7 The pressure support synchronized with the respiratory effort of the patient results in better ventilator-patient synchrony and decreased work of breathing. 8, 9 Thus, this mode offers combined advantages of both PCV and SV at the same time.",

An additional advantage of PSV was an early emergence time, which can be explained by less propofol consumption in the PSVPro group. This decreased emergence time also translated to decreased time to achieve a modified Aldrete score of more than or equal to 9 in the pressure support group. Capdevila et al. observed a significant 15 min decrease in emergence time in the PSV group compared with the PCV group.",

Patient-ventilator asynchrony was seen in 40% of patients in the PCV group. Asynchronous events were accompanied by a transient increase in entropy values which required escalation of propofol infusion. The entropy between both groups was kept at 40-60 in both groups by adjusting the propofol infusion rate. On the other hand, PSV mode provided pressure support to each breath initiated by the patient, thereby achieving an adequate tidal volume that was fully synchronized with the respiratory effort of the patient. This improved patient-ventilator synchrony and decreased work of breathing.",

This fact has already been highlighted by previous authors who found improved oxygenation with the pressure support mode than with the spontaneous mode of breathing. [12] [13] [14] A similar observation of improvement in lung functions and oxygenation with PSV compared with the PCV was made by Zoremba et al. in 68 moderately obese patients. 15 Our study has some limitations. The major limitation of the study was the increased use of propofol to reduce asynchrony in the protocol, when propofol consumption was used as an outcome measure. Also, complete blinding was not possible. Another limitation was that although entropy was continuously monitored and propofol was titrated accordingly, to avoid data noise we recorded and analyzed the entropy values only at predefined time frames. Also, we did not measure time to discharge as it is the routine protocol in our institution to observe all patients for at least two hours postoperatively in the PACU. We did not compare it to patients on spontaneous ventilation as we had selected surgeries of more than 45 min. These results are relevant only for patients receiving GA through the use of LMA. Also, these results cannot be extrapolated to very small children.",
