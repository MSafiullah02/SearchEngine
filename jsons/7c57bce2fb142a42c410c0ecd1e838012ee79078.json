These reverse genetic systems include targeted recombination, in vitro ligation, vaccinia virus vectors, and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). Quickly after the identification of Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), both in vitro ligation and BAC-based reverse genetic technologies were engineered for MERS-CoV to study its basic biological properties, develop live-attenuated vaccines, and test antiviral drugs. Here, I will describe how lambda red recombination can be used with the MERS-CoV BAC to quickly and efficiently introduce virtually any type of genetic modification (point mutations, insertions, deletions) into the MERS-CoV genome and recover recombinant virus.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that cause both significant human and veterinary disease. Prior to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003, human CoVs were only known to cause mild, self-limiting upper respiratory diseases. Approximately 10 years after the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV emerged in the Middle East where it then spread to 27 different countries, and to date (December 2018, WHO) there have been 2278 laboratoryconfirmed cases and 806 associated deaths for a case fatality rate of 35%. Most of these cases have occurred in the Middle East, aside from an outbreak of~200 infected individuals in South Korea in 2015 [1] . Infectious clones are highly valuable research tools that enable modification of viral genomes to better understand their fundamental biology, develop novel vaccine candidates, and test antiviral therapeutics. Soon after identifying MERS-CoV as the causative agent of MERS, two distinct infectious clones were reported for MERS-CoV [2, 3] . These infectious clones were engineered using in vitro ligation or bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), each of which had been used previously for CoVs [4] [5] [6] . In vitro ligation uses unique type II restriction endonucleases that cleave several bases away from their recognition site, allowing for the reassembly of authentic CoV genomes from smaller fragments. Each fragment is separately maintained in its own small plasmid for efficient genetic modification using traditional molecular cloning methods. Separating specific nucleotide sequences in ORF1A helped to eliminate the problem of these sequences being toxic for bacteria. A T7 promoter is inserted at the 5 0 end of the genome, allowing for in vitro transcription of the viral RNA and subsequent transfection into mammalian cells for virus production. In contrast, BACs allow for the stable propagation of full-length CoV cDNA in bacteria, due to the ability to restrict their copy number to 1 or 2 plasmids per cell. Different restriction fragments of these BACs can be sub-cloned into smaller vectors for efficient modification, or the full-length genome can be modified using lambda red recombination, which will be discussed here. CoV BAC plasmids contain a CMV promoter 5 0 of the viral genome, allowing for transcription of the viral genome following transfection of BAC DNA into mammalian cells. In addition, the CoV BACs contain a polyA tail, a Hepatitis D Virus (HDV) ribozyme, and bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination and polyadenylation signals to create genomic RNA with an authentic 3 0 end. The full-length nature of BAC DNA and the CMV promoter subvert the need for in vitro ligation or transcription to recover infectious virus. BACs were initially developed in the early 1990s, and by the mid-late 1990s they were utilized by Herpes virologists for modification of these large DNA viruses, which revolutionized the field. A few years later a BAC for a CoV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was engineered, and since then BACs have been successfully developed for several CoVs including feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), OC-43, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, murine hepatitis virus strain JHM (MHV-JHM), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and the SARS-like CoV WIV-1 [2, 4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Thus, it is likely that BAC-based reverse genetics could be useful for any novel or emergent CoV.",

            "text": "Lambda red recombination utilizes bacteriophage enzymes Exo, Beta, and Gam (Red proteins) to mediate homologous recombination near the ends of linear double-stranded DNA [13, 14] . PCR products containing positive selection markers are suitable substrates for these enzymes, so long as they bear extensions of 40-50 bases that are homologous to the target sequence. A major advancement in this technique came with the development of an E. coli strain, DY380, where the Red proteins were placed under the control of a temperature-inducible promoter [15] . Several methods for removing the positive selection markers from the viral genomes have been developed, including flanking sequences with FRT or loxP sites [16] , or utilizing positive and negative selection markers on a single gene cassette, such as the Galactose Kinase (GalK)-Kan R gene cassette [17] . These methods both have certain downfalls, including the retention of small FRT or loxP sites following removal of the marker, or the unintended removal of negative selection markers by repeat sequences in the BAC plasmid. To improve the efficiency of removing the positive selection marker, a unique method utilizing the I-SceI homing endonuclease under an arabinose-inducible promoter was developed ( Fig. 1 ) [18] . I-SceI is an endonuclease with an 18 bp recognition site that is not present in the E. coli genome, making it safe to express in E. coli. In the method described here, this recognition site is engineered on a plasmid (pEP-KanS) just outside of the positive selection marker, and its cleavage with the I-SceI enzyme allows for the removal of the positive selection marker by intramolecular Red recombination utilizing sequence duplication introduced in the original PCR primers. This method can be utilized to introduce any type of modification into the BAC DNA, including mutations, deletions, and insertions. Here I will outline the procedure for this highly efficient method to engineer markerless modifications, focusing on single point mutations in the full-length MERS-CoV BAC. [2] . The full protocol for creating this BAC was subsequently published by the same group in a previous Methods in Molecular Biology book [19] . This plasmid contains the parA, parB, and parC genes derived from the E. coli F-factor to prevent more than one or two BACs from coexisting in the same cell. It also contains genes involved in the initiation and orientation of DNA replication and the chloramphenicol resistance gene (Cml r ).",

To design simple point mutations, start by developing a 60 bp flanking sequence, calling each 20 base pair section as A, B, and C. Then incorporate the desired mutation at the end of section B (40th base pair, or the 39th and 40th base pair if two changes are required). Finally, attach this sequence to the 22 bp Kan r -I-SceI sequence below to create your forward recombination primer. To create the reverse recombination primer, create a new block of 20 bp we will call section D 0 that is the reverse complement of the sequence immediately downstream from section C. These 20 bp will be followed on your primer by sections C 0 and B 0 , the reverse complements to sections B and C, with B 0 containing the desired mutations. Finally, add the 23 bp Kan r -I-SceI sequence to finish the reverse primer. During negative selection, sections B/C will recombine with B 0 /C 0 leading to the loss of the Kan R -I-SceI cassette (Fig. 1g) . For deletion mutants, leave out the desired sequence from your primers. For instance, to delete sections D/E/F, simply create the forward primer with sections A/B/ C, and the reverse primer with sections G 0 /C 0 /B 0 . Insertions of small sequences can be achieved by adding the entire insertion sequence at the 3 0 end of the forward primer, and at least 50 bp of reverse complement sequence at the 3 0 end of the reverse primer (Fig. 2) . Larger insertions may require the development of a full plasmid, or potentially the use of nested PCRs. For additional details, see ref. [18] . While designing recombination primers (indicated below), remember to also order short primers about 100-200 bp outside of the insertion site to check for the proper insertion of the gene cassette by PCR.",

DH10B cells are recombination-deficient (recA1) and endonuclease I-deficient (endA1) and have constitutive deoxyribose synthesis for improved cloning of large plasmids. These traits make these cells ideal for the long-term storage of BAC plasmids.2.
