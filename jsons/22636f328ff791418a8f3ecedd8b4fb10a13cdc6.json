In Q1 2020, through the timeline described in Table 1 , COVID-19 (named after \"COrona VIrus Disease, 2019\") had escalated from a a small marketplace in Wuhan, China, to cause the international social distancing and home isolation of over 1 billion people worldwide, with enormous social, political and economic repercussions to follow (Goodell [2020] , Sharif et al. [2020] ). The dislocating effects on the economy were expected to be unprecedented since the 1920's depression Baldwin and di Mauro [2020] . However, in the middle of this chaos, an abnormality began to manifest. Brands that shared the same name with aspects of the 'coronavirus' began to report abnormal losses and sustained periods of trading volatility. While financial market conditions had deteriorated quite extensively, some companies were experiencing added pressures simply because their name or product base had in some way contained the term 'corona'. This research sets out to establish how this pressure manifested.",

Kot [2011] investigated similar response in Hong Kong, Biktimirov and Durrani [2017] in Canada, Mase [2009] for companies in the UK and Kadapakkam and Misra [2007] found evidence supporting significant declines in trading volume and prices on dates when tickers were changed for companies. Kashmiri and Mahajan [2014] analysed as to whether pricing abnormalities existed for entities that were founded on historical found family ties. Whereas, investigated the dynamics of this behaviour in falling markets, identified changing dynamics of flows in the markets for mutual funds. In recent works, Jain and Jain [2019] and Sharma et al. [2020] analysed the pricing effects of companies adding the term blockchain to their names. Head et al. [2009] investigates the salience issue further, from the perspective of memorable stock tickers yielding excess returns, further reinforced by Xing et al. [2016] . In recent years, naming effects have also been identified to have influential when considering the addition of the terms 'blockchain' and 'cryptocurrency' into the corporate identity of the company, or through the addition of highly speculative cryptocurrency projects ).",

The results are presented in Table 2 , with evidence of the associated share price behaviour and volatility presented in Figure 1 . We can observe in the shaded regions of these graphs quite a strong variation in share price performance, with Constellation Brands, as owner and importer of the beer brand, Corona in the United States (STZ) and Corona Corp (5909.JP) presenting evidence of sharp declines during the pandemic period, while Coronation Fund Managers (CML), a South African company, presenting evidence of a fall in share price, but noticeably less than the other analysed companies. However, visual inspection presents evidence of sharp, elevated and sustained pricing volatility for both STZ and CML in comparison to that of 5909.JP.",

Evidence of sharp declines are evident in the period thereafter through exceptionally changes evident in the minima, skewness and kurtosis of these short-term returns. The summary statistics of the selected variables are presented in Table   3 . Times are adjusted to Greenwich Mean Time to allow for comparability across the selected geographical regions. For the purpose of exchange comparison out-of-session, daily returns are used to measure dynamic correlations (similarly to the methods used by , Katsiampa et al. [2019a,b] ). The time period also allows us to disaggreagate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic from the generalised equity market rout that was occasioned by the widespread arrival of the virus to the USA and European countries (on Feb 27 new cases outside China exceeded those within China for the first time, as presented in Figure 2 ) and the \"oil price war\" which began on 9-10 March. The changing correlations between the identified companies susceptible to the 'corona' naming shock and these financial assets are presented in Table 4 . Comparing the periods both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic for each of our selected companies. In the case of each analysed company, there is evidence of sharp elevated positive correlations between each and the selected analysed assets. However, for companies such as Constellation Brands Inc, the owner of the beer branded Corona, while possessing a correlation of 0.032 and 0.025 respectively with both of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, both correlations increase sharply to 0.286 and 0.315 respectively. All companies, investigated present evidence of sharp elevations in correlation, however, this interaction between STZ, CML and Asian markets is particularly interesting as domestic correlations do not follow the same trend. This evidence suggests a sharp decoupling of the market performance of each company with their domestic exchange with simultaneous evidence of interactions where none existed before.",

Further, there is an exceptionally large significant increase in hourly volatility for each of the analysed companies. While in Figure 3 , we observe the time-varying dynamic conditional correlations between each exposed company and the two key Chinese markets, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. In each case, after mitigating international effects, there is evidence of a sharp increase in dynamic correlations between the companies and Chinese markets with the exception of CML in South Africa. There is clear evidence that Constellation Brands (STZ) and Corona Corp (5909:JP) experienced a sharp and sustained deterioration in share prices outside of that expected through market-driven forces. The reasons for so would be deemed somewhat irrational, but mostly very unfortunately driven by name association. In general, all three considered companies have no interactions with hedging alternatives with two exceptions. 5909.JP has negative interactions with gold while CML has positive interactions with WTI. For robustness, a similar methodology was applied in Figure 4 for comparable companies such as Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, Ambev SA and United Breweries Co. Inc. We observe that similar sharp elevations in dynamic correlations with both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are not observed.",

The intention to buy Corona beer in the United States among adults has fallen to its lowest level in the past two years, while the perception of the brand has also collapsed. In a 27 February 2020 release, 5W conducted phone surveys with 737 American beer drinkers, identifying that 38% of respondents would not buy Corona under any circumstances since the beginning of the coronavirus. Further, 16% of respondents stated confusion as to whether Corona beer was actually related to the coronavirus. A measure of how likely consumers are to buy the beer has fallen to a two-year low (according to YouGov, a market research firm). Corona's rating according to the firm had fallen to 51 from 75 at the start of the 2020, indicating a strong decline in sentiment towards the brand.",
