            "text": "Image segmentation is a fundamental task in image analysis. Consequentially, a large number of segmentation methods have been developed ranging from local thresholding to methods using statistical models of shape variation (Pham et al., 2000, Sonka et al., 2008). The simplest available segmentation methods rely on local pixel-by-pixel segmentation decisions such as Otsu thresholding or methods based on clustering. These fully-local decisions are often not sufficient and because they neglect spatial dependencies, they are sensitive to noise and not directly applicable if an object is defined by its boundary surface only (e.g., if only the cell membrane or a cell membrane surrogate is imaged, but an image of the entire cell is desired). To overcome these limitations, non-local approaches have been proposed based on intelligent local merging decisions or by formulating optimization problems incorporating spatial dependencies. The former class of methods encompasses region growing approaches such as the popular watershed segmentation (Sonka et al., 2008). The latter class of methods includes active-contours and -surfaces (Sapiro, 2001) as well as general parametric models which may use statistical information on shape and/or appearance (Cootes et al., 2001, Pizer et al., 2003).",

However, for less structured cases these methods are not applicable. In microscopy, for example, images often contain hundreds or thousands of cells, cell nuclei, or organelles, with possibly large variations in shape and a priori unknown locations. While local thresholding or active-contour-type models may be applied in such cases, they are often too generic, too sensitive to noise, or require the judicial placement of seed points to assure an appropriate segmentation result to avoid over- or under-segmentations.",

A possible option is to use information about simple geometric properties. In this paper we explore an approach for a segmentation with constraints on the segmentation area. Such a method can counteract potential leakage or shrinkage biases in a principled way. Such biases can be observed, for example, for active contour (Sapiro, 2001) or graph cut (Boykov and Funka-Lea, 2006) segmentations when boundary regularity is encouraged by penalizing a weighted length of the segmentation boundary. Area constraints may not be appropriate for all biomedical segmentation tasks; however there are a large number of problems in which reasonable area or volume intervals are known a priori. Our objective in this paper is not to perform an actual study for a particular biological problem, but rather to demonstrate the behavior of a segmentation method with area-constraints on realistic image data. We use electron tomography datasets of synaptic vesicles and of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) implicated in the SARS-coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) replication (Knoops et al., 2008).",

While area-constraints can formally easily be added to the optimization problems for segmentation, solving the problems is hard. However, if finding a globally optimal solution is not of concern and a good initial guess for a solution is available, one can resort to standard methods from constrained optimization. For example, a curve evolution approach with an area penalty can be used (Ayed et al., 2008).

For example, several circles with increasing radii or squares with increasing side lengths with small weights g. Assume that the weights are chosen such that all discontinuities of the resulting segmentation (for the original problem and its relaxation) occur only at these shape boundaries. This can always be achieved by assigning sufficiently large weights outside the desired boundaries. These concentric shapes are indexed by a scale parameter r, e.g. the radius of a circle or the diagonal of a square. The shape itself is not important, but only that the area of the shape is c\nA\nr\n2 and its circumference is c\nL\nr for suitable constants c\nA and c\nL. We drop these constants without loss of generality in what follows. We would like the segmentation to snap into successively larger shapes when increasing the lower bound on the area.

The segmentation energy (2) is proportional to r\ni (for \u03c1\ns\n = 0) and the area is proportional to ri2. Without loss of generality, set r\n1\n = 1. To obtain the middle shape from the segmentation, we enforce Al\u2208r12,r22=1,r22. The segmentation energy of the desired shape (for an integer-solution) is E\nint\n = \nr\n2. Under the relaxed segmentation model the optimal solution needs to occur at r\n2 or r\n3. Since smaller values for u will lead to smaller overall energy values, the optimal relaxed solution will have A(u) = \nA\nl. Therefore, for a jump at r\ni the uniform fractional value for u which fulfills the area constraint exactly will beu=Al-r12ri2-r12=Al-1ri2-1,i\u2208{2,3}.The energy values (for a jump from 1 to u at r\n1\n = 1 and from u to 0 at r\ni) areE^i=r1(1-u)+riu=ri2-1+(Al-1)(ri-1)ri2-1=ri+Alri+1.But then A\nl\n > 1 and r\n3\n > \nr\n2 by assumption leads to E^3<E^2. This shows that the middle shape cannot be recovered by thresholding and the fractional solution has a lower energy than the solution for the integer program. Fig. 1 illustrates the difference between the relaxed and integer solutions for successively larger lower bounds on the area for concentric squares with foreground seeds at the center of the image and background seeds at the image boundary. As predicted, the relaxed solution is blind to the middle square and simply uniformly increases the fractional values of u with increasing A. In contrast, the integer solution is able to capture all three squares.",

For practical segmentation problems full control over all pixels is in many cases not necessary. Instead, it is desirable to obtain a good approximation to the original optimization problem while controlling the computational complexity of the method. Hence, we replace the control of individual pixels by the control of coarse selection areas Bk. Since we solve this problem by branch-and-bound the resulting reduction in the number of integer variables reduces the effort to compute the solution drastically (because it reduces the size of the branch and bound tree). The original integer program (1) with the non-relaxed maximum flow energy is recovered if the Bk correspond to individual image pixels s\u2209S\u222aT. If desired, maximal flow formulations with direction-dependent costs could be used (Zach et al., 2009b, Zach et al., 2009a). For formulations with only a lower area bound, the last condition is replaced by u\ns\n \u2a7e \nb\nk (and similarly for only an upper bound).",

Then the constraint is essentially inactive and \u201cinvisible\u201d to the segmentation algorithm. The difficulty lies in finding these seed points (without requiring a user to provide close to the final segmentation as input). Integer programming solves this problem by intelligent pixel-by-pixel searching. However, even though the existing search methods (Nemhauser and Wolsey, 1988) avoid the combinatorial explosion inherent to a brute-force approach, search trees will still get extremely large even for moderately small problems unless special problem structure can be exploited.

The solution boundaries are expected to be located close to where their cost is low, i.e., where g\ns is small. Hence, we try to avoid placing the boundaries of selection regions there and let the remaining pixels not covered by any selection region snap into the best boundary location. We use homogeneous image regions for the Bk, which can be derived from super-pixels (Vedaldi and Soatto, 2008, Comaniciu and Meer, 2002) or from an image oversegmentation using a watershed method (Vincent and Soille, 1991). Formulation (3) is more general than a direct super-pixel segmentation (e.g., one can use seed regions covering only a subset of the image to guide the segmentation while having complete representational freedom close to putative segmentation boundaries). To define the Bk, we use quick-shift (Vedaldi and Soatto, 2008) to find super-pixels and erode them so that they do not touch the potential segmentation boundaries. Quick-shift is an efficient mode-seeking algorithm based on medoid shift (conceptually similar to the popular mean-shift segmentation algorithms Comaniciu and Meer, 2002). It provides a tuning parameter to control under- and over-fragmentation of modes and can therefore be used to indirectly control the number of selection regions to be detected. Our method is not dependent on quick-shift, and other clustering methods such as mean-shift or k-means (Jain et al., 1999) could be substituted. Fig. 2\nshows an illustration of the selection regions. In addition to the max-flow method addressed in this paper we expect this approach of facilitating area-constraints through selection regions also to be generally useful for other segmentation methods.",

Segmentation boundaries can pass through such \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d selection areas if desired. Specifically, if only a lower-bound is imposed, then the selection regions drive the actual segmentation values u\ns through the inequality u\ns\n \u2a7e \nb\nk. Therefore setting a selection region to 1 forces the segmentation value u\ns to be 1 for s\u2208Bk. However, setting a selection region to 0 amounts to leaving the segmentation values u\ns free. Hence, the solution will neither be forced to 0 or 1 in such an area and can be completely determined pixel-wise by the underlying image. The segmentation will be robust to selection regions that cross segmentation boundaries as long as there are a sufficient number of selection regions on the inside of an object that can be set to 1 so that the segmentation naturally \u201csnaps\u201d into the desired location. However, when we enforce a lower and an upper bound, we need to be able to increase and decrease the natural size of an unconstrained segmentation by setting regions to 1 or 0 respectively. In this case, selection regions crossing segmentation boundaries will matter because they have to be set to either 0 or 1. Consequentially, enforcing an upper and a lower bound may produce results which are worse than enforcing only a lower bound. This problem could easily be avoided by moving from binary to ternary selection variables (0: set to zero, 1: set to one, 2: do not care). This would leave the overall approach intact, but would result in a slightly different branch and bound implementation, which is not our focus here.",
