This chapter considers the rationale for automated room disinfection (ARD) systems, which offer the potential to improve the efficacy and reliability of hospital disinfection. An assessment of the level of surface contamination that is a risk for transmission and understanding the limitations of conventional cleaning and disinfection methods is important to appreciate the potential of ARD systems. This chapter provides a detailed overview of the four classes of ARD system that are most commonly used in healthcare settings: aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP), H2O2 vapor, ultraviolet C light (UVC), and pulsed\u2011xenon UV (PX-UV). The differences between these systems in terms of their technological aspects, microbiological efficacy, evidence of clinical impact, and practicalities are described, along with a brief overview of other ARD systems and a consideration of their comparative effectiveness and cost. Based on these differences, the scenarios in which various ARD systems may be indicated are discussed in detail. Finally, future trends are considered.",

            "text": "At one time, contaminated surfaces were thought to contribute negligibly to endemic transmission of pathogens in hospitals [3], [4]. However, recent data indicate that contaminated surfaces make an important contribution to the endemic transmission of certain nosocomial pathogens [1], [3], [5]. The most convincing evidence comes from studies showing that admission to a room previously occupied by a patient colonized or infected with certain pathogens increases the risk of subsequent occupants acquiring these pathogens a factor of around two [1], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. This association has been demonstrated for Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n[1], [7], [9], [10], [11]. The epidemiological association is strengthened by the finding that improving terminal room disinfection reduces or eliminates this increased risk [8], [12], [13]. Thus, current terminal cleaning and disinfection following the discharge of patients with these pathogens is inadequate and needs to be improved. The increasing age and susceptibility of hospitalized patients, combined with the emergence of more virulent and epidemic strains of C. difficile such as 027/NAP1 and potentially untreatable multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria such as pan-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, carbapenemase-producing organisms, and certain viruses (for example the SARS Coronavirus), are further reasons to improve environmental decontamination [14], [15].",

In the 1960s, formaldehyde was replaced by aerosolized chemicals such as quaternary ammonium compounds and phenolics due to concerns over toxicity and provided promising data on effectiveness [25], [26], [27]. However, concerns over efficacy and safety led to advice from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since the 1970s that disinfectant fogging should not be performed routinely in patient-care areas [27], [28]. The increasing recognition of the importance of environmental contamination in transmission has prompted the development of several new ARD systems based on either hydrogen peroxide or ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The improved efficacy and safety of these systems compared with the disinfectant aerosolizers of the 1960s and 1970s have prompted a re-evaluation of the CDC recommendation [16].",

All mice became infected when exposed for 1 hour to 100 spores/cm2 and 50% became infected when exposed to 5 spores/cm2. The concentration at which none of the mice became infected was less than one spore per cm2. In the healthcare environment, room exposure times are usually measured in days and so the estimates by Lawley et al. are likely to be conservative. Lawley et al. then examined which disinfectants were able to interrupt the transmission of C. difficile and established a relationship between the level of inactivation of C. difficile spores in vitro and the degree to which transmission was interrupted (Fig. 15.1\n). Although data from animal studies should be interpreted with caution, these studies suggest that a low level of contamination can transmit spores to a susceptible host, and that there is a proportional relationship between the level of surface contamination and the degree of transmission.",

The widespread presence of dry-surface biofilm also contributes to the failure of conventional methods because microbes in biofilms are more difficult to physically remove from surfaces and less susceptible to disinfectants [52], [53], [54]. Other problems include the delegation of responsibility for cleaning, which can fall between staff groups such as nurses and environmental hygiene staff particularly in the case of complex portable medical equipment [55]; difficulties in measuring the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection [16] and achieving compliance with protocols/policies from an (often) poorly paid, poorly motivated workforce who may have limited spoken or written local language skills [56]; inadequate training and education of personnel [56]; inadequate time given to do the job properly [56]; insufficient (or nonexistent) cleaning prior to disinfection [47]; incorrect formulation of the disinfectant [50], [57]; and contamination of cleaning solutions/materials [57], [58].",

            "text": "Modifying human behavior is difficult but several different approaches can be taken, including routine microbiological analysis of surface hygiene, the use of fluorescent markers or ATP assays to assess the thoroughness of cleaning, feedback of cleaning performance, and education to enhance knowledge about the importance of the process [8], [16], [36], [51], [59], [60]. The development of improved protocols and structured career progression for cleaning staff should be considered in addition to monitoring and feedback. This can improve the frequency of surfaces that are cleaned [51], [61] and reduce the level of environmental contamination [62], [63]. There is some evidence that improving the efficacy of conventional cleaning/disinfection can reduce the acquisition of pathogens [8], [64], [65], [66]. For example, Hayden et al. [65] performed a 9-month prospective before-after study of educational improvements of cleaning and hand hygiene: the proportion of surfaces contaminated with VRE was reduced from 24% to 12% and patient acquisition of VRE was reduced from 33 to 17 acquisitions per 1000 patient-days. More recently, Mitchell et al. [66] performed a randomized controlled trial of an environmental hygiene bundle, which demonstrated improved cleaning performance and reduced HCAI for some organisms but not others [67]. Similarly, Datta et al. found that an educational improvement of cleaning performance reduced the rate of some organisms but not others [8]. These studies suggest that while improvements to conventional approaches to environmental hygiene can reduce transmission and HCAI, more can be done to maximize patient safety.",

The systems used most commonly in healthcare use a solution containing 5%\u20136% hydrogen peroxide and < 50 ppm silver (Fig. 15.2\n) [72], [75], [76], [77], [78]. These systems are sometimes known as \u201cdry-mist hydrogen peroxide,\u201d though this term is a poor reflection of their properties [79], [80]. Aerosolized droplets are introduced into an enclosure via a unidirectional nozzle [16], [71]. One manufacturer (ASP Glosair) states a particle size of 8\u201310 \u03bcm [81], [82] whereas another (Oxypharm Nocospray) states a smaller particle size of 0.5 \u03bcm [72]. The dose typically recommended for hospital rooms is 6 mL per m3, although multiple cycles of this dose have been used in several studies [81], [83]. Following exposure, the aerosol is usually left to decompose naturally, without any active aeration in most systems, although some have an active aeration system to reduce cycle times.",

Two systems using H2O2 vapor are available commercially\u2014Bioquell and Steris. Bioquell systems are usually termed hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) and Steris systems vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). Bioquell HPV includes a generator to produce HPV including a module to measure the concentration of HPV, temperature, and relative humidity in the enclosure and an aeration unit to catalyze the breakdown of HPV to oxygen and water vapor after HPV exposure. A control pedestal is situated outside the enclosure to provide remote control. Bioquell HPV is delivered until the air in the enclosure becomes saturated and hydrogen peroxide begins to condense on surfaces [84], [85]. Steris VHP systems have a generator inside the room with an integral aeration unit and dehumidifier designed to achieve a set humidity level prior to the start of the cycle. The system is controlled remotely from outside the enclosure. Steris VHP systems deliver \u201cnoncondensing\u201d VHP by drying the vapor stream as it is returned to the generator. Bioquell systems do not control the H2O2 air concentration while the Steris systems hold a steady H2O2 air concentration throughout the exposure period.",

An in vitro study established a dose-response relationship between the concentration of hydrogen peroxide used in an HPV system and the microbiological efficacy [108].

VHP has been used for tackling environmental reservoirs during outbreaks of A. baumannii in two reports [85], [117]. The clinical impact of VHP aside from outbreak settings is not reported. On the other hand, three studies have assessed the impact of HPV in the setting of endemic infections. A prospective cohort study by Passaretti et al. demonstrated that patients admitted to rooms vacated by patients with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and disinfected using HPV were 64% less likely to acquire MDROs than patients admitted to such rooms disinfected using standard methods [13]. Thus, HPV decontamination successfully mitigated the risk from the prior room occupant. Several prepost studies have evaluated the clinical impact of HPV [43], [118], [119], [120]. For example, Boyce et al. performed a before-after study showing that HPV decontamination of rooms vacated by patients with C. difficile infection (CDI) significantly reduced the incidence of CDI both on targeted wards and hospital-wide when the analysis was restricted to the months when the epidemic strain was known to be present [43]. McCord et al. [119] reported a significant reduction in CDI associated with the implementation of HPV to augment discharge disinfection protocols in a 4-year prepost study with a 2-year intervention period.",

The capacity of single units to decontaminate areas larger than single rooms is limited so multiple generators may be necessary [81]. Doors and air vents should be sealed and hand-held health and safety monitors are required to ensure that no leakage occurs during cycles and to verify that the concentration of hydrogen peroxide inside the enclosure is below health and safety exposure limits [82]. Reported cycle times are 3\u20134 h for multiple cycles [81], [96] and 2 h for single cycles [77]. However, cycle times for single rooms may be considerably longer when hand-held sensors are used to ensure the hydrogen peroxide concentrations are below health and safety limits prior to room re-entry [82]. Several studies suggest that homogeneous distribution of the active agent is not achieved [77], [81], [82], perhaps because aHP is introduced via a unidirectional nozzle and the particles are affected by gravity. Sublethal exposure to hydrogen peroxide or silver could result in the development of tolerance or resistance [50], [127], [128]. The potential for transferable resistance to silver is greater than for hydrogen peroxide due to plasmid-mediated silver resistance genes [127], [128]. Data are required confirming the compatibility of aHP systems with common hospital materials, including sensitive electronics. Finally, several studies have noted equipment reliability problems [77], [82], [93], which was a feature of older foggers [27].",

However, H2O2 vapor systems are less straightforward than UV and aHP systems because they require two units (a generator and aeration unit) for a single room. Door and air vents need to be sealed. As with aHP, hand-held health and safety monitors are required to ensure that no leakage occurs during cycles and that the concentration of hydrogen peroxide inside the enclosure is below health and safety exposure limits (1 ppm) before re-entry. Thus, staff training requirements for using hydrogen peroxide systems are higher than for UV systems. The potential for selection of less susceptible strains is lower than for aHP or UV systems because the high concentration H2O2 vapor systems ensures that few micro-organisms undergo sublethal exposure. Reported cycle times are currently 1.5\u20132.5 h for a single room for HPV [129], [130] and 8 h for VHP [85]. The compatibility of HPV with hospital materials, including sensitive electronics, is well established [131], [132].",

Many high-touch sites may be out of line of sight; some manufacturers recommended multiple cycles in different parts of the room to overcome this problem but this places reliance on the operator to choose appropriate equipment locations, has implications for cycle times, and requires more hands-on operator time. A recent study indicates that a UVC spore cycle in rooms ranging from 46 to 86 m3 took a median of 84 min (range 72\u2013146 min) for a two-stage procedure (where the UVC unit is positioned at two locations during the cycle) and a median of 68 min (range 34\u2013100 min) for a one-stage procedure [86]. Since some UVC systems rely on measurement of reflected dose to determine the cycle, the presence of surfaces that do not reflect UVC, or reflect it inefficiently (such as glass), variations in temperature and humidity and the age of the bulbs will affect the reflected dose and may increase the cycle times [133], [134]. The intensity of the UV light dissipates with the square of the distance from the source, which limits the capacity of single UVC devices to disinfect areas larger than single patient rooms [135]. The long-term impact of UVC on hospital materials has not been described [136]. UVC is relatively expensive compared with other ARD systems [137]. Finally, UV radiation is a known mutagen [138]; since UVC systems do not inactivate all microbes in the room, a proportion of those that have received a sublethal dose may undergo mutation.",

Two studies of different ozone generators were performed in test chambers of 30\u201335 m3, which used a concentration of ozone gas peaking at 20\u201325 ppm. These studies indicated a 3\u20134 log reduction on vegetative bacteria, a < 3-log reduction on mycobacteria, and a dose-dependent < 3-log reduction on bacterial endospores in one study [140] but a > 4-log spore reduction in the other [139]. Both evaluations tested the systems at high humidity, one at 80%\u201390% [140] and one at > 95% [139]. Another system used a high concentration of gaseous ozone (80 ppm) and up to 3% aerosolized hydrogen peroxide combined with high humidity (80%) to achieve a > 6-log reduction of various hospital pathogens in vitro [141]. Substantially lower reductions were achieved at lower relative humidity [141]. The requirement for high humidity is a major practical limitation for ozone-based systems [142]. Furthermore, ozone is toxic to humans, with a safe exposure level in the United Kingdom and United States of < 0.1 ppm (compared with 1 ppm for hydrogen peroxide), so effective containment of the gas, monitoring for leakage, and measurements to assure that the room is safe to enter are necessary for these systems in the healthcare setting [143], [144]. Data on the compatibility of this process with hospital materials are needed, given ozone\u2019s known corrosive properties [17].",

BIs can be produced in-house or, more reliably, can be purchased commercially (typically containing G. stearothermophilus bacterial endospores). Most ARD systems produce a more significant reduction of bacterial contamination than conventional disinfection [39], [41], [77], [80], [86], [87]. However, comparison of the relative effectiveness of different ARD systems is difficult because of variations in sample sites (especially orientation and proximity to the ARD device), patient infection or colonization status, the organism, the microbiological testing methods, and the type of precleaning. Thus, the best way to compare different systems is through controlled head-to-head studies [71], ideally using clinical infectious or transmission outcomes. However, there have been few studies comparing these outcomes, so it is not possible to evaluate the relative clinical impact of ARD systems using current data. Thus, the available head-to-head studies are currently the most useful way to compare ARD systems.",

Testing was performed in a 50 m3 room with a 13 m3 anteroom, selected to represent a single occupancy room with a bathroom. Safety was evaluated using a hand-held hydrogen peroxide sensor. The workplace exposure limits (WEL) for hydrogen peroxide are 1 ppm as an 8-h time weighted average, or 2 ppm for 15 min as a short term exposure limit (STEL) [144]. The HPV manufacturer mandates re-entering the room only after the measurable concentration of hydrogen peroxide is < 1 ppm; the aHP manufacturer recommended room re-entry 2 h after the start of the cycle. Thus, in this study the mean concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the room was measured 2 h after the cycle started for both systems. The mean hydrogen peroxide concentration in the room 2 h after the cycle started was 2.8 \u00b1 0.8 ppm for aHP, with a maximum reading of 4.5 ppm and no readings < 2 ppm, and 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 ppm for HPV, with no readings > 2 ppm. Thus, for both systems room re-entry must be controlled by measurements of H2O2 concentrations rather than assuming safe levels at the end of the process. A \u201ccontrolled leakage\u201d experiment was performed in the St George\u2019s study to determine whether hydrogen peroxide leaked from an unsealed room door. This was only done for the aHP system because the user manuals recommend door and air vent sealing with adhesive tape for the HPV system but not for the aHP. > 20 ppm H2O2 was detected outside an unsealed door, indicating that doors must be sealed during cycles. These findings also imply that air vents should be sealed during room disinfection with hydrogen peroxide systems.",

In addition, in-house prepared test discs dried in three or 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to simulate dirty conditions were tested in two further room locations. There are no standard testing methods for ARD systems, so the in-house test discs were used to measure log reductions of the common nosocomial pathogens and 6-log and 4-log G. stearothermophilus BIs were used two provide two levels of challenge. HPV inactivated 91% (40/44) of the 6-log and 95% (42/44) of the 4-log G. stearothermophilus BIs. HPV generally achieved a 6-log reduction of the MRSA, A. baumannii, and C. difficile BIs regardless of room location. aHP inactivated 13.6% (6/44) of the 6-log BIs, and 36.4% of the 4-log BIs. aHP achieved a < 4-log reduction at 2/11 room locations for MRSA, 7/11 for A. baumannii and 2/11 for C. difficile spores. The aHP system had reduced efficacy against the catalase-positive A. baumannii with a < 2-log reductions at 6/11 of room locations. HPV achieved a > 5-log reduction at 11/12 locations with MRSA, A. baumannii, or C. difficile dried in three or 10% BSA compared with 3/12 locations for aHP. This suggests that HPV is more able to penetrate increasing levels of soil, which may be important with suboptimal precleaning. The log reduction of the in-house prepared test discs varied considerably by room location for aHP but not for HPV, indicating a more uneven distribution of the active agent for aHP.",

The risk associated with individual pathogens in the context of disinfection will depend on a number of factors, including the importance of environmental contamination in transmission, clinical implications, local epidemiology, and financial outcomes. For example, a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rod or C. difficile causing an outbreak would be considered a \u201chigh-risk\u201d pathogen, whereas VRE colonization would be considered lower risk. Further issues that may need to be considered are the clinical, financial, and reputational effects of environmental infections, especially during on-going outbreaks requiring ward closures. Closures may have particular adverse impacts when they involve specialist regional units such as those for neonatal, pediatric, or adult intensive care.",

However, this may be necessary and justified to bring a serious outbreak of high-risk pathogens in high-risk patients under control. It may be practical to use UV systems for the disinfection of single rooms used by patients with low-risk pathogens in low-risk settings [87], [88] but practical constraints limit the use of hydrogen peroxide ARD systems in this situation. Conversely, H2O2 vapor systems would be appropriate for dealing with high-risk pathogens in high-risk units because of their high levels of efficacy, homogeneous distribution, and disinfection assurance [41], [43], [116]. Examples include on-going outbreaks in intensive care units with NAP1/027 C. difficile or a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogen. UV and hydrogen peroxide systems may be suitable for disinfection of single rooms in low-risk settings with high-risk pathogens or in high-risk settings with low-risk pathogens [39], [43], [77], [87], [96]. Enhanced conventional disinfection methods should also be employed in these scenarios [8], [42], [64], [65], [159], [160], with the possible exception of high-risk pathogens occurring in high-risk settings where even enhanced conventional disinfection has been shown to leave residual contamination [8], [35], [41], [42].",

For example, Otter et al. evaluated the efficacy of HPV for the inactivation of MRSA dried on stainless steel discs in suspending media containing 0.3%, 3%, and 10% BSA [107]. The effectiveness of HPV was reduced as the concentration of BSA increased. There is evidence that some ARD systems are more susceptible to organic soiling than others.

Another option is the use of BIs, which provide a semiquantitative measure of microbiological efficacy and repeatability [43], [81]. The question remains as to whether 6-log BIs are an appropriate test for validating ARD systems, given that the concentration of contamination on hospital surfaces is usually in the 2-log range [37], [81], [167]. Walder and Holmdahl [37] argue that soiling and biofilms [168], [169], occasional higher levels of contamination [35], the occurrence of pathogens with reduced susceptibility to certain agents [90], and the potential for incomplete distribution [81], [82], [152] mean that 6-log BIs are an appropriate target for ARD systems. Recent evidence published by Pottage et al. [90] and others [82], [91], [93] indicating that catalase-positive bacteria are less susceptible to hydrogen peroxide-based ARD systems than bacterial endospores provides a further reason to use stringent challenges for these systems [167].",

Further evidence on the optimal application and cost effectiveness of ARD systems in healthcare is required, but ARD systems are already beginning to be integrated into hospital disinfection policies [13], [43]. Regulators and professional bodies should decide on the terminology and insist on standardization for these systems and, as adoption and the evidence-base grows the role of regulators and professional societies will become increasingly important in the provision of advice and guidelines to ensure the safe and effective use of ARD systems in healthcare settings [28], [177].",
