The virus causes severe economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide because it can affect the upper respiratory and reproductive tracts, and some strains can cause nephritis in chickens [1].

Many studies have shown that the degree of cross-protection tends to decrease among IBV serotypes and genotypes [4], [5].",

However, producing a live IBV vaccine requires lengthy strategies that are time, cost, and labor intensive. Attenuation of IBV by multiple passages (over 100) in embryonated eggs can delay a new vaccine's clinical availability for several years. This drawback is compounded by the time required for verification of the vaccine to obtain licensing, as well as the current lack of available cell lines for vaccine production, which could accelerate vaccine production. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the viral strain used to produce the vaccine will still be endemic at the time of vaccination [7], [8], [9].",

Therefore, the best protective effect that can be achieved would be only against strains of the same serotype or genotype [3]. However, the development of vaccines against the new IBV variants is not generally an option owing to the high cost and time required for their final approval. Moreover, the use of multiple strains of live vaccines should be practiced with caution owing to concerns regarding the formation of variants of viruses by recombination with field strains resulting from the spread of vaccine strains [21]. Thus, rapid development of a live IBV vaccine that provides broad cross-protection would be a highly relevant and practical method in IBV control. In this study, we aimed to develop a novel live attenuated IBV vaccine with broad-spectrum protective capability using a heat-attenuation method in a considerably short time.",

The initial selection of the K40/09 virus for this purpose was guided by the fact that this strain has a favored vaccine candidate background that contains two genetically characterized nephropathogenic strains (KM91 and QXIBV) as a recombinant strain [22] and showed significantly high levels of immunogenicity and protective ability against many different types of IBV [11]. Our approach to heat-adapting IBV differed in two ways from previous attempts [13]. Differences included the viral strain (nephropathogenic IBV strain) and the number of passages at high temperature (up to 50 times). In general, current methods for IBV attenuation include serial passage of virus in chicken embryos over 50 times, and the nephropathogenic IBV strain seemed particularly refractory to attenuation [7], [8]. Although the mechanism of heat attenuation is unknown, this is the first study to attenuate a nephropathogenic IBV strain by heat adaptation. Furthermore, based on our data, it is likely that adaptation at progressively higher temperatures would provide rapid attenuation of IBV and selective pressure for cumulative mutations that confer less virulence for chickens.",

The goal of vaccination by drinking water or spray is to immunize the highest percentage of the poultry in a flock at a given time. However, in summer, uniformity of immunization can be further decreased by a loss of IBV vaccine titer caused by relatively high temperatures during vaccination. A persistent rolling reaction among birds in a flock can occur if many birds are missed or receive a low dose, resulting in disease outbreak. When the virus was incubated at 56 \u00b0C, the heat resistance time of K40/09 parent was 120 min, but K40/09 HP50 virus survived up to 450 min (data not shown). The results presented here suggest that use of K40/09 HP50 subpopulations resistant to heat inactivation could be helpful for reducing vaccine failure rates through the uniform administration of the vaccine.",

However, fine droplets (50\u201380 \u03bcm in size) containing the vaccine virus might be inhaled too deeply into the respiratory tract (lung and air sac) tissues, resulting in disease with an excessive post-vaccination reaction in young chicks. Thus, the use of a coarse spray with a droplet size greater than 100 \u03bcm is generally suitable for hatchery vaccination. The safety of K40/09 HP50 was demonstrated by administering the vaccine to 1-day-old SPF chicks via spray. Based on their safety profiles, the non- and low-heat-passaged viruses (K40/09 and K40/09 HP40) produced a milder clinical disease response with mild histopathological lesions of tracheas and kidneys when administered by fine spray, but the K40/09 HP50 virus was no longer pathogenic for 1-day-old chicks, as demonstrated by lower ciliostasis and histopathologic lesion scores. Considering the fact that spray vaccination was applied using fine spray (50-\u03bcm droplets) in our safety study, K40/09 HP50 is considered to be very safe and useful for hatchery spray vaccination.",

Although the K40/09 parental strain was chosen based on its cross-protective ability [8], it is not clear whether the fully attenuated K40/09 HP50 still induced cross-protection. In efficacy studies, all viruses (K40/09, K40/09 HP40, and K40/09 HP50) provided almost complete protection for tracheas and kidneys against nephropathogenic strains of Korean group II (QXIBV-like and KM91 strains) with high neutralizing-antibody titers. These findings indicate that K40/09 HP50 retained its immunogenicity after serial passage. Nephropathogenic strains of different serotypes are a major problem worldwide; therefore, it has been proposed that the polyvalent vaccine formulation expanded the level of cross-protection against nephropathogenic IBV strains over that achieved by individual vaccine strains [26]. However, the use of multiple strains of live vaccines may contribute to the variation and recombination of IBV, and engender even more complex IBV epidemics. Conversely, our results suggest that single administration of K40/09 HP50 is markedly effective and economical due to its broad-spectrum protection against nephropathogenic IBV strains, including QXIBV, which are worldwide epizootic strains [11].",

The results of the present study show that heat adaptation could be a very useful method to enhance the safety of IBV, and the heat-adapted K40/09 HP50 virus exhibits a fine balance between attenuation and immunogenicity, and exhibits cross-protective efficacy.
