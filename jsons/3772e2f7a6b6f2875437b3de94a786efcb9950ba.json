Three DAL lots were evaluated at dilutions of 1:10, 1:20, and 1:40, with contact times of 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 min. Approximately 7 log 10 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) of EBOV/Mak was exposed to DAL at ambient temperature. Each dilution tested reduced the infectious EBOV/Mak titer by ~5 log 10 within one min. Detectable virus was still present after an 0.5-min exposure, but each DAL dilution caused >4 log 10 reduction within this time. Detection of virus below the limit of detection of the TCID 50 assay was assessed by inoculating flasks of Vero E6 cells with undiluted neutralized sample and evaluating the cultures for cytopathic effect after 14 days incubation. No infectious virus was detected with this nonquantitative method in samples subjected to DAL for 5 or 10 min, regardless of the dilution evaluated. The rapid and substantial inactivation of EBOV/Mak by DAL suggests that use of this hygiene product could help prevent the spread of Ebola virus disease during outbreaks.",

The Ebola virus is a member of the Filoviridae family, and being an enveloped virus should be relatively susceptible to a variety of microbicidal inactivation approaches.

Dettol is used in Europe, Africa, and Asia in homes and healthcare settings for various first aid antiseptic purposes, including wound cleansing 9 . It is also used for personal hygiene purposes, and as a microbicide for decontaminating environmental surfaces, objects, and equipment. The microbicidal active ingredient in DAL is 4-chloro-3,5-dimethylphenol (chloroxylenol), also known by its non-systematic name para-chloro-meta-xylenol or PCMX 10 . The concentration of the active in DAL is 4.8% (weight to volume) PCMX. Three concentrations each of DAL lots 15083E, 16004E, and 16005E were evaluated for inactivation of EBOV/Mak suspended in an organic soil load using the method specified in the ASTM 1052-11 international standard 11 . This test method was developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials International (ASTM) to standardize the evaluation of virucidal activity of microbicidal products in suspension. Organic soil loads are added to the study design in order to better model viral inactivation by microbicides in relevant matrices such as human sputum or blood. Use of hard water as diluent was included in the study design to simulate water hardness in the field. Four contact times (0.5, 1, 5, and 10 min) were evaluated in triplicate for each of three independent lots of DAL. In addition to the methodology described in the ASTM standard, we also evaluated any residual infectious virus following exposure to DAL through inoculation of 500 \u00b5L of undiluted neutralized test sample into T-75 flasks of Vero E6 indicator cells. This was done to evaluate the possibility of virus being present at levels lower than the limit of detection of the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) assay performed in Vero E6 cells per the ASTM standard.",

During the evaluation of possible neutralizing agents, it was determined that 100% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100% virus culture medium (VCM) failed to adequately terminate the viral inactivating effects of DAL. On the other hand, 1\u00d7 Letheen broth in VCM (10\u00d7 Letheen broth diluted 1:10 in VCM), added to the DAL dilutions prior to introduction of the EBOV/Mak in tripartite soil load 12, 13 , prevented inactivation of the virus. As shown in Supplemental Figs S1 and S2, no statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences in the viral titers obtained for the virus positive controls, the virus + DAL dilution + neutralizer, and virus + neutralizer conditions were observed when 1\u00d7 Letheen broth was evaluated. The disinfectant neutralizing agent that was used in each of the inactivation efficacy studies described below was 1\u00d7 Letheen broth. Virucidal Efficacy Results. Three different lots of DAL were evaluated at three dilutions of DAL each (1:10, 1:20, and 1:40 in hard water, corresponding to 0.48%, 0.24%, and 0.12% of PCMX active, respectively) in triplicate. Contact times of 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 min at ambient temperature were evaluated in a BSL-4 facility. An initial EBOV/Mak titer of 1.7 \u00d7 10 8 log 10 TCID 50 /mL in tripartite soil load was exposed to the various DAL dilutions and contact times using the methodology depicted in Fig. 1 . The post-exposure/neutralization titers for the positive virus controls (virus alone) and the DAL test conditions were calculated. The log 10 reduction values for each time point were calculated by subtracting the titers obtained for the DAL test conditions from the titers of the corresponding positive virus controls.",

In a sample matrix consisting of 98% fetal bovine serum, there was no statistically significant log 10 reduction of Ebola virus resulted from a 1-hour exposure to 0.1% Triton X-100. A similar result was obtained when 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate was used as the inactivating agent. In samples containing lower percentages (9.8%, 0.98%) of fetal bovine serum, the inactivation caused by these agents was >3 log 10 , but still not complete. The inability of Triton X-100 at up to 1% to completely inactivate Ebola virus in blood serum has also been reported by Burton et al. 22 and Colavita et al. 23 .",

For instance, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stated in its 2012 disinfectant product guidance 24 that \"The product should demonstrate complete inactivation of the virus at all dilutions. If cytotoxicity is present, the virus control titer should be increased to demonstrate a \u22653 log 10 reduction in viral titer beyond the cytotoxic level. \" For disinfectants that are non-cytotoxic to the cellular infectivity assays used for demonstrating efficacy, a 4-log 10 reduction in viral titer is considered to be effective. These EPA requirements for demonstrating acceptable efficacy were recently modified in the 2018 revision 25 . In the revised guidance, a valid test requires (1) that at least 4.8 log 10 of infectivity per carrier be recovered from the dried virus control film; (2) that a \u22653 log 10 reduction in titer must be demonstrated in the presence or absence of cytotoxicity; (3) if cytotoxicity is present, at least a 3 log 10 reduction in titer must be demonstrated beyond the cytotoxic level; and (4) that the cell controls be negative for infectivity. In the revised guidance, therefore, an efficacious product does not need to demonstrate complete inactivation at all dilutions.",

The mortality associated with Ebola virus disease is high. For example, the overall case fatality rate for outbreaks occurring between 1976 and 2017 has been calculated as 67% 26 . The infectious dose of Ebola virus is believed to be relatively low in humans (between 1 and 10 infectious units) 16, 27 . The median plasma viral load in confirmed Ebola virus disease patients during the 2014-2015 Sierra Leone outbreak was found to be 6.7 log 10 genomic copies per mL (range: 5.5 to 7.8 genomic copies/mL) 28 . The average peak blood serum titer in cases from the 2000-2001 Uganda outbreak with a fatal outcome was 3.4 \u00d7 10 9 genomic copies per mL, corresponding to 3.4 \u00d7 10 5 to 3.4 \u00d7 10 6 infectious units per mL 29 . Human-to human transmission of Ebola virus disease has been attributed to direct contact with infected blood (including reuse of contaminated needles) or other secretions or bodily fluids of infected persons, and to contact with infected corpses 30, 31 . For example, infected patients have been reported to produce large volumes (5 L or more) of watery diarrhea over a period of 7 days or longer 32 . The point of this discussion is to stress that the Ebola virucidal efficacy needs to be as high as possible, and certainly should be greater than the 3 or 4 log 10 reduction routinely expected of microbicidal products.",

In addition, however, studies were conducted in a manner intended to assure that no infectious virus remained following application of the microbicidal product. The latter studies, referred to here as flask safety testing, was based on the assumption that any residual infectious viral particles following exposure to DAL should be able to infect the susceptible Vero E6 cells in the inoculated T-75 flasks and to amplify over a 14-day observation period, causing detectable viral CPE in the flasks. The greatest assurance of complete inactivation of EBOV/Mak was demonstrated for contact times of 5 min or greater (DAL dilutions of 1:20 and 1:40) or 1 min or greater in the case of the 1:10 DAL dilution. Under these conditions, over 5 log 10 reduction in titer of infectious Ebola virus in tripartite soil load was demonstrated in the quantitative TCID 50 assay and no detectable virus was detected in the non-quantitative flask safety tests.",

Inactivation efficacy testing for DAL was performed in suspension studies (Fig. 1) conducted at ambient temperature per ASTM E1052-11 11 . Stocks of EBOV/Mak in tripartite soil load were prepared on the day of assay as follows. A single tube of stock virus was removed from frozen storage and mixed with a tripartite soil load 12,13 (~1.7 \u00d7 10 7 TCID 50 virus, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.35% tryptone, 0.08% mucin). The virus in tripartite soil load (10 \u00b5L) was added to 90 \u00b5L of diluted DAL or to 90 \u00b5L VCM (positive virus control). The resulting solutions were mixed and held at room temperature for 30 seconds, 1 min, 5 min and 10 min contact times. At the end of each exposure time point, the DAL was neutralized by adding 900 \u00b5L of prepared 1\u00d7 Letheen broth to the test solutions and pipetted repeatedly to mix. A 500-\u00b5L portion of each neutralized test solution was diluted in VCM using a ten-fold dilution scheme, and 50 \u00b5L of the resulting dilutions were added to 96-well plates containing Vero E6 cells monolayers (n = 5 replicates per dilution). After a 45-min adsorption www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ period, 150 \u00b5L of VCM were added to each well. The Vero E6 cell monolayers in the wells were scored 14 days post-infection for CPE and virus titers (TCID 50 ) were calculated according to the Reed-Muench method 33 .",

The values represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (n = three replicates, one for each DAL lot) of the log 10 titer of the positive control (0 minutes contact time) and the postneutralization samples (0.5, 1, 5, and 10 minutes contact time). Individual viral titers were calculated based on three replicate wells per dilution. The limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was 1.8 log 10 TCID 50 /mL (shown in the plot as a blue line extending from y = 1.8 log 10 TCID 50 /mL). This was due to the cytotoxicity of the DAL dilution to the Vero E6 cells.",
