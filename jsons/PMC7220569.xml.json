            "text": "On December 31, 2019, an unknown outbreak spread from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly worldwide (1). The main clinical symptoms of this unexplained pneumonia are similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which can quickly develop from mild fever, fatigue, and dyspnea to severe pneumonia. Starting from the management experience of the SARS epidemic, China has rapidly carried out comprehensive prevention and control. On January 7, 2020, China officials officially announced that it would temporarily name the unexplained pathogen in Wuhan as 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) (2,3). The confirmed cases reported from outside China support human-to-human transmission (4,5), which indicates that the outbreak is difficult to control (6,7). After two meetings on January 30, 2020 (January 22 and January 23, respectively), the World Health Organization regarded the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV as a public health emergency (8,9). Although the development of vaccines has long-term prevention and control effects, rapid identification of drug treatment during the epidemic is the key to responding to the outbreak (10), and there is no clear treatment method at present (11). Studies have found that 2019-nCoV is a single-stranded RNA beta coronavirus similar to SARS and MERS (12), so current treatment is mainly based on the treatment experience of these two diseases (13) and further development of new targeted drugs. Currently, the drugs studied for the treatment of 2019-nCoV mainly include antivirals, antimalarials, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, biological agents, and traditional Chinese medicine, among which lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, remdesivir, chloroquine phosphate, and interferon are the main drugs. Here, we systematically review the current research that can be used in the treatment of 2019-nCoV, providing a theoretical basis for the next step of treatment and prevention.",

Chinese studies have found that the combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir has a more obvious inhibitory effect on coronavirus during SARS (15). It is considered that the half-life of lopinavir can be increased by inhibiting cytochrome P450, thereby enhancing the antiviral effect. Lopinavir/ritonavir is a known antiretroviral drug targeting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is being evaluated for anti-2019-nCoV treatment (16). A randomized controlled clinical study of the effect of 2019-nCoV cases (ChiCTR2000029308) is also underway (17,18). At present, the National Health Council has recommended the use of lopinavir and ritonavir as antivirus regimens for 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia. The latest recommended dose is listed in our table (19).",

However, unlike the approved nucleotide analogues, experimental results confirmed that they had a stronger effect on both human infection coronavirus and various bat-derived coronavirus, significantly inhibiting virus replication in human primary cell culture (25). A recent cell experimental study indicated that remdesivir could inhibit 2019-nCoV in vitro infections (26). It is considered that remdesivir can effectively inhibit respiratory virus replication and improve virus-infected lung tissues (23). Here is a report on the cure of an American patient infected with 2019-nCoV after remdesivir (27). Theoretically, remdesivir is currently the most promising drug for the treatment of 2019-nCoV and has relatively complete data on human pharmacokinetics and safety (28). More relevant clinical randomized controlled studies have been registered (mild-to-moderate 2019-nCoV: NCT04252664; severe 2019-nCoV: NCT04257656) and are expected to be completed within the next 2 months.",

Soon, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine was tested in hospitals of Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places for the treatment of 2019-nCoV-associated pneumonia (34). Chloroquine, as a known antimalarial drug, can inhibit the production and release of inflammatory factors in viral diseases and has antiviral effects on many diseases including HIV-1, hepatitis B, and HCoV-229E (35). Recent studies have shown that chloroquine can inhibit 2019-nCoV by increasing the endosome pH required for viral cell fusion (26), and its antiviral and antiinflammatory activity considerations are also involved (36). A related open trial (ChiCTR2000029609) is ongoing.",

Previous studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies can remarkably improve the MERS-CoV infection (51). Research by Mark et al. shows that monoclonal antibodies REGN-EB3 and mAb114 can significantly reduce the mortality of patients with Ebola (28). Reviewing the recently research progress, it is suggested that monoclonal antibodies can be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV (52). However, no relevant monoclonal antibodies have been successfully marketed yet (53). It is mainly based on the latest experiments that the CR3022 can effectively bind to the 2019-nCoV receptor\u2013binding domain (50) that mainly targets the spike protein and inhibits the virus from attaching to the host cell, thereby preventing the virus from invading. Through this passive immunotherapy, it makes the treatment more targeted, and it is conducive to the development of vaccines (53).",

The main representative drugs are lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, remdesivir, interferon, and so on (Table I). More choices are being put into the research process, such as barretinib (64), imatinib (31), sunitinib, erlotinib (65), nitazoxanide (26), and other potential drugs, as well as fusion peptide (EK1) (66), HR2P (67), and other new peptides. And the development of vaccines is also a long-term goal. We need more clinical practice to test out more old drugs that can be used for treatment and, at the same time, search for new drugs with targeted and effective results.",
