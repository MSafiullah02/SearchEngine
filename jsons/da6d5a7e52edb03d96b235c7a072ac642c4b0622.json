The time period of 29 January to 18 March 2020 was specifically selected to focus on early SARS-CoV-2 viral introductions into the UAE. The first index patient in the UAE was reported on the 29 January 2020. Subsequently, Emirates airlines suspended flights to and from 30 destinations across the world from 18 March and Dubai airport was closed to passenger flights on 25 March 2020; hence, patients after 18 March 2020 were expected to be more likely a result of community transmission as opposed to imported infections. In brief, the index patient with COVID-19 in the UAE was a female Chinese tourist (aged 63 years) travelling from Wuhan with her daughter-in-law and two grandchildren to visit her son working in Dubai. The Chinese family arrived in Dubai on 16 January 2020 and the grandmother, son, daughter-in-law, and one grandchild all tested positive on the 29 January 2020 (Table 1) . Over the next seven weeks, there were multiple new travel-related possible introductions of the virus into the UAE from European and Iranian tourists and residents, and a cluster of cases amongst residents with no travel history ( Table 1) . Of the 49 COVID-19 patients in Dubai, 22 had a travel history from Europe including Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Norway, and the United Kingdom ( Table 1) . Nearly two-thirds (63.3%) of patients were male and 61.2% were aged between 20 and 44 years reflecting the young age structure of the UAE population [4] . Majority of patients (88%) were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms and only four required intensive care with invasive ventilation. There were strong occupational links in several patients including a woman who flew from Italy to Dubai for business (L5752), two airline cabin crew with a positive travel history from Austria and Italy (L1014, L1076, respectively), and two members of a professional cycling team (L9333, L9756) who tested positive during the UAE 2020 Cycle Tour. The seven-stage cycle tour was cancelled on 27 February 2020 following the fifth stage when numerous riders and support staff tested positive and all riders and teams had a positive travel history from Europe following previous cycle races within the last 7-14 days.",

The majority (76%) clustered with clades A2a (48%) and A3 (28%) which are largely composed of isolates from COVID19 patients in Europe and Iran, respectively. This clearly suggests that the major introductions into the UAE during the early phase of the pandemic originated from Europe and the Middle East/Iran. Supporting its European origin, all individuals with the A2a clade isolates were mostly European and/or with recent travel history to a European country, mainly to Italy (n=4), Germany (n=3), United Kingdom (n=2), Spain (n=1), and Norway (n=1) ( Table 1 and Figure 2 ). Onset of symptoms reported in this group was within or after the second week of March (Table 1) suggesting that the viral infections in this group could have occurred during late February to early March. Of note, a SARS-CoV-2 isolate submitted from Mexico (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_412972) was 100% identical to that of an Italian expatriate working in the UAE (L0881), while another submitted in Germany (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_412912) differed by a single mutation (Figure 1 ). All three individuals had a recent travel history to Italy and overlapping infection time frames (late Februaryearly March).

Onset of symptoms for the five individuals with travel history in this group was reported to be around 21-24 February ( Table 1) .

Interestingly, all but one isolate obtained from patient L4682the only patient in this group with severe clinical presentationshared a common ancestral strain identical to that obtained from patient L2409. The SARS-CoV-2 isolate from L4682 had two unique missense variants in the ORF1ab gene (Table  S2 ) which might be worth investigating for any possible biological effect(s). Consistent with its Iranian origin, a SARS-CoV-2 sequence submitted by the University of Sydney (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_412975) on 28 February 2020 differed by only two mutations from that of L2409, and both this Iranian male tourist and the Australian male had a recent travel history to Iran.

L6599 was an Indian expatriate living with three other Filipino and Sri Lankan expatriates (L3715, L2771, L8480) ( Table 1 ).
