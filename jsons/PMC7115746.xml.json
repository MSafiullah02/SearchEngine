These tests are well established, but they require several assay steps, well-trained technical staff and a significant time to obtain reliable results (Ivnitski et al\n1999, Dhayal et al\n2006). Therefore, sensitive biosensors that accurately detect, in a label-free manner and in real time, are highly required (Ivnitski et al\n1999, Lazcka et al\n2007). Among the biosensors, cantilever-based mass sensors have been widely used in bio-medical applications due to the very high sensitivity of the cantilever structure (Lavrik and Datskos 2003, Lavrik et al\n2004, Gupta et al\n2004, Waggoner and Craighead 2007). They generally work better in the gas state because of higher quality factors and hence higher sensitivity than in the liquid state, which may make it unnecessary to introduce airborne microorganisms into liquids. However, the number of biological particles that can be placed on the cantilever surfaces for detection is usually very small compared to the total number of particles tested, which requires an active collection method such as electrostatic capture to increase overall sensor sensitivity.",

The advantage of this particle collector is that flow swirling makes particles stay long and slow down in the collector, which gives rise to many particles to be captured. In this paper, we will investigate the effects of the inlet/outlet configurations of the particle collector on the electrostatic capture of nanoparticles with simulation and experiments. In fact, the number of particles flowing in the collector varies spatially along the collector, depending on the inlet/outlet configurations. Therefore, it is critical to find information on where inside the collector the most particles flow because biosensors need to be exposed to as many particles as possible, especially if the biosensors involve cantilevers. We also present the capture of Vaccinia viruses with different flow rates in the same collector and compare these measurements with nanoparticle experiments. The highest and smallest capture positions inside the collector will be determined by these experiments. The effects of particle diameters on the electrostatic capture will also be discussed. This collector is well suited for integration with cantilever sensors for the detection of bioaerosols and can be a promising choice in terms of real-time monitoring.",

In the current simulation, both flow and electric fields were obtained separately and particles were traced from flow fields without considering the effects of electric fields on the particles. These particle tracks give important information on the relationship between the particle velocities, the distance from the electrodes to the particles and the captured particle counts with the electrode position when the electrostatic forces are almost constant with the electrode positions (Jang et al\n2007). Particle trajectories in the collector were numerically computed with the discrete phase model of a CFD code FLUENT 6.2. The flow fields were obtained based on the incompressible laminar flow model. In fact, the Reynolds numbers based on the inlet diameter are 137 and 248 at 1.1 l min\u22121 and 2.0 l min\u22121, respectively.",

The error bars represent the standard deviations of the measurements. The flow rate of 1.1 l min\u22121 was chosen because it is recommended by TSI for the electrospray aerosol generator. Moreover, many handheld airflow devices work at a flow rate range of several liters per minute. We observed that much more particles were captured in the FO configuration than the other two configurations. In fact, the number of particles collected in the FO configuration was about 3\u20136 times larger than that collected in the SO configuration, depending on the electrode. We also observed that the number of particles captured in the BO configuration was slightly larger than that captured in the SO configuration although the measurements in both configurations were overlapped within their standard deviations. It is interesting that the least particles were captured in the SO configuration, which is most commonly used. For all the three configurations, the particle counts in the electrodes A, B, D and E were shown to be close within their uncertainties while the particle counts captured in the center electrode C were much less than those captured in the other surrounding electrodes. In fact, the particle counts captured on the electrode C were about 30\u201340% of those captured on the electrode E in the three configurations. Therefore, the center position is the last to place the biosensor for all the three configurations. We will further discuss these measurements with simulation in the next section.\n\n",

However, particle capture measurements in both configurations were shown to be close within their standard deviations. This can be attributed to the fact that the particles in the BO configuration stay almost as long as those in the SO configuration do. In fact, if two particles flow with the same velocities at the same distance from the same electrode, the particle staying longer under the electric field will have a higher probability to be captured. Likewise, more particles in the FO configuration are shown to flow slowly than those in the BO configuration for all the electrodes. In addition, the travel times of particles in the FO configuration are much longer than those in the other configurations. This simulation shows a good agreement with the experimental data that the most particles were captured in the FO configuration. According to the experiments and simulations above, we can conclude that the FO configuration is the most advantageous to particle capture among the tested configurations.",

The simulation shows that the number of 10 \u00b5m diameter particles flowing over the electrodes B and D decreases compared to the smaller particles, which means that the inertia of those large particles gets more important in particle transport and those particles are reluctant to swirl in the collector. The increase in inertia can also happen to the large particles flowing over the electrodes A, C and E, but these electrodes are in the straight line of the incoming flow path so the number of particles does not change as much as the electrode B and D cases. The increased inertia may cause more particle losses before the collector due to sedimentation or abrupt change in the flow path (Brockmann 2001).\n\n",
