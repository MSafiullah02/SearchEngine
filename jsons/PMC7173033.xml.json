To our delight, functionalization at the benzylic position occurred as expected, affording \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated carboxylamide 2a in a 23% yield (Table 1\n, entry 1). Control experiments showed that this reaction proceeded with similar results in the absence of AgOAc, while the reaction did not occur without KOAc (Table 1, entries 2\u20134). Then, various Lewis acids were screened in this reaction (Table 1, entries 5\u20139). When one equivalent of PbCl2 was used as the Lewis acid, the yield of product 2a increased to 55% along with some amount of sulfide product 3a (Table 1, entry 9). The effect of the base on the reaction was screened with various bases. The results of this screening indicated that potassium acetate and sodium acetate are the most favorable bases for this reaction (Table 1, entries 9\u201311 and details in supporting information). When the reaction was carried out in air or under O2 atmosphere, the yield of product decreased (Table 1, entries 12\u201313). In contrast, under N2, the reaction afforded product 2a in a 65% yield (Table 1, entries 14). This indicated that the oxidizing reagents hindered the reaction from proceeding. The effect of temperature on the reaction was subsequently investigated, which showed that temperatures either above 160 \u00b0C or below 150 \u00b0C were not suitable for this reaction (Table 1, entries 14\u201317). Finally, optimized reaction conditions of PbCl2 (1.5 equiv) and KOAc (1.5 equiv) in DMSO at 156 \u00b0C in a sealed tube under N2 for 13 h gave the product 2a in 77% yield and 3a in 12% yields, respectively (Table 1, entry 17). Interestingly, when Ac2O was used instead of PbCl2, sulfide product 3a was obtained in 50% yield (Table 1, entry 18). The combination of Ac2O/AcOH, or Ac2O/TsOH, or TFAA/TFA in DMSO, commonly used in the Pummerer rearrangement reaction, did not afford any product.",

Isolated sulfide 3a was subjected to the standard reaction conditions, affording product 2a in 75% yield with 22% recovery of 3a (eq. (1)). When purified 2a was put back under the standard conditions, it gave 17% yield of 3a with 74% recovery of 2a. These results indicated that there is an equilibrium between 2a and 3a in the reaction mixture. When the reaction was carried out in DMSO-d\n6, it provided the corresponding deuterated products (d\n2\n-2a and d\n5\n-3a) in 73% and 9% yields, respectively, which provided precise evidence for the methylene group originating from the solvent dimethylsulfoxide (eq. (3)). When six equivalents of TMPO was added to a reaction run under the reaction conditions, 53% of 2a and 5% of 3a were still obtained, which suggested that this reaction probably did not involve any radical species (eq. (4)). Moreover, two control experiments showed that both Lewis acid PbCl2 and KOAc are necessary for the reaction to occur (see the supporting information).\n",

This reaction tolerated mono-, di- or even tri-substituted patterns on the phenyl ring. Interestingly, a substrate with a heterocycle instead of a phenyl ring, such as thiofuran, afforded the corresponding product (2o) in a synthetically useful yield (Table 2). When substrates with electron-withdrawing groups on the phenyl rings were subjected to the standard reaction conditions, they gave low yields of the corresponding products. After an exploration of the types and amounts of bases, it was found that decreasing the amount of KOAc to 0.6 equivalent led to good yields of 2p-x and 3p-x with the concomitant production of dimeric compounds 4p-v (Table 3\n).

The identity of both the Lewis acid and base were found to be critical for this reaction to proceed well.
