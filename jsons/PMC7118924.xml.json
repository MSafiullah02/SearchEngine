For some types of infectious agents, such as the coronavirus that has been etiologically linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), respirators instead of standard surgical masks may be required to prevent NI. The Occupational Safety and Health Association requires that, when engaging in any patient care activity that may result in exposure to potentially contaminated blood or other infectious materials, health care workers must wear gloves (and other protective attire) to prevent disease transmission by way of contaminated hands.18 Gloves have their limitations, however, and are not intended to replace or eliminate handwashing. Moreover, because gloves can tear and their function as a protective barrier become compromised, double gloving may be advantageous and important to minimize the risk of exposure to blood-borne pathogens.19., 20. Gloves should be removed after caring for each patient.18., 21.\n",

Failure to thoroughly clean all of a reusable instrument's potentially contaminated surfaces significantly increases the risk of sterilization failure and NI.1., 2., 7. The use in the sterile field of only sterile instruments as prescribed by aseptic technique is one of infection control's most crucial requirements. Not all instruments used during a surgical procedure, however, require sterilization. Whereas sterilization is required for all critical instruments that penetrate sterile tissue or enter the vascular system, such as biopsy forceps used during GI endoscopy, scalpels, and IV catheters, high-level disinfection is recommended for semicritical instruments that routinely contact mucous membranes, such as GI endoscopes, bronchoscopes, and respiratory therapy equipment.23 The proper packaging or wrapping, storage, and handling of surgical instruments is also important to prevent contamination of the sterilized instrument before its use and introduction into the sterile field.",

Similarly, when visibly soiled, the walls, doors, and surgical lights require spot cleaning.24 In general, it is recommended to clean the operating room's entire floor once at the end of the day, a practice known as \u201cterminal cleaning.\u201d When visibly soiled after a procedure, however, a perimeter of a few feet around the surgical field requires cleaning.

Indeed, these arguably are infection control's 2 most important practices.5., 23., 26. Failure of health care workers to wash their hands and to comply with hand hygiene guidelines is a leading cause of NI and the spread of multiple-resistant microorganisms.18., 25., 27. Nevertheless, despite the plethora of data that demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of frequent handwashing to the prevention of disease transmission, reports indicate that compliance by health care workers with published handwashing guidelines is often poor.18., 28. Reasons for poor compliance are many and include skin irritation and dryness linked to hand detergents; high patient workload and understaffing, which can limit the amount of time available for thorough handwashing and proper hand hygiene; and a shortage of hand-cleaning sinks located in convenient and easily accessible locations.18\n",

There are, however, several infection control practices and procedures for the prevention of disease transmission that are as important in the office-based, outpatient GI endoscopy setting as in the operating room setting. An example is the aseptic preparation, handling, and administration of IV medications.3., 31. Contamination of the patient's IV tubing or of an IV medication's vial, ampoule, or filled syringe, whether in an operating room setting or an office-based, outpatient GI endoscopy setting, can result in NI, septicemia, or other serious patient complications.10., 32., 33., 34., 35. Breaches in aseptic technique during the use of an IV medication have been linked to 3 reports of transmission of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) during GI endoscopy.3., 15., 16., 31. One of these reports documents HCV transmission at a GI endoscopy clinic as a result of the reuse of needles and the contamination of multiple-dose anesthesia medication vials.3., 31. Another of these reports links the transmission of HCV to the reuse of a syringe used to administer IV medications, including propofol, to 2 different patients during colonoscopy.16 And the 3rd report suggests that contamination of multiple-dose IV medication vials or reuse of a syringe on more than 1 patient (or inadequate disinfection of the colonoscope) was responsible for HCV transmission during colonoscopy.15\n",

Check daily each medication's expiration date and discard all that have expired.2.Label each predrawn syringe. Include the medication's name, its strength and dosage, the date and time the ampoule or vial was opened, and when the syringe was filled.36 This practice is especially important when using propofol.37 Discard all unlabeled medications.3.Use aseptic technique during the preparation, handling, and administration of all IV medications.31., 35.\n4.For each patient, use a sterile, single-use, disposable syringe, needle, and administration set (ie, IV tubing and connections).3., 31., 33., 40. Large-volume syringes filled with medications should be administered to only 1 patient (even if the syringe's needle is changed) and then discarded.5.Visually inspect each IV medication before its administration. If particulate matter or discoloration is detected, or contamination suspected, discard the medication.37\n6.Whenever feasible, administer each IV medication promptly after opening its prefilled syringe or after opening its ampoule or vial and filling the sterile syringe.32., 35., 36. The practice of filling syringes with IV medications in the morning for use throughout the day (or for use the next day) can be problematic.37., 39. Unless otherwise stated on the medication's label, it is recommended that all predrawn syringes be discarded within 24 hours (or when completely used, whichever comes first).36\n7.Propofol is an exception to this 24-hour recommendation. In general, propofol requires administration within 6 hours after opening its vial and filling the (sterile) syringe,36., 37., 39., 40. although prompt administration is recommended.35 When propofol is administered directly to the patient from its original vial or prefilled syringe, without having first been transferred to another syringe or container, all unused portions must be discarded within 12 hours (rather than 6 hours).36., 37.\n8.Before inserting a sterile needle, disinfect the vial's stopper or the ampoule's neck surface using 70% isopropyl alcohol (or its equivalent).35., 37.\n9.Whenever feasible, the use of single-dose medication vials, prefilled syringes, and ampoules is recommended. Do not puncture a single-dose vial more than once. Note that the labels of some IV medications, such as propofol, limit the use of its prefilled syringes and vials to only 1 patient.31., 35., 37., 40.\n10.Care is emphasized and caution warranted whenever using multiple-dose vials, as their use has been associated with transmission of HCV and other infectious agents.3., 13., 16., 31., 41. Do not pool into a single vial residual medications from 2 or more other vials, for future use.3\n11.Mixing more than 1 medication in a single syringe for their simultaneous administration is not recommended.36\n12.After their use, promptly discard all syringes and needles at the point of use in an appropriate puncture-resistant and leak-proof sharps container.31\n13.Establish a quality assurance and infection control program that encourages the health care workers responsible for filling syringes to also be in charge of handling and monitoring the syringes before administration of IV medications.14.Store all unused IV medications, syringes, and needles in a clean and secure area, to prevent contamination, misuse, and theft.34\n\n",

Periodic review of these practices and procedures to ensure they are up-to-date and account for new and emerging infectious diseases, such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and SARS, is recommended. Whereas infection control and aseptic technique in the operating room setting is universally practiced and understood, their application to the GI endoscopy setting, where sterile tissue is not always violated and sterile instruments not always required,30 is sometimes less clear and not always as strictly enforced or exercised. Indeed, specific violations in aseptic technique have been implicated as the cause of disease transmission during GI endoscopy.3., 14., 15., 16., 31. As a result, presentation of educational sessions that discuss and review the application of infection control and aseptic technique to GI endoscopy is recommended. Also recommended is the development of programs designed to improve understanding of the modes of disease transmission and compliance with the principles of infection control, aseptic technique, standard precautions, contact precautions, droplet precautions, and airborne precautions, as each applies not only to the traditional operating room setting, but also to GI endoscopy (and bronchoscopy).42 Establishment of a quality control program that monitors adherence to aseptic technique during the preparation, handling, administration, and storage of IV medications, particularly propofol, is emphasized.",
