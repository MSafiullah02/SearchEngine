However, to maintain essential services, a substantial number of workers are not subject to these limitations, and maintain many of their pre-intervention interactions. To explore how interactions among such \"essential\" workers, and between essential workers and the rest of the population, impact disease risk and the effectiveness of pandemic control, we evaluated several models of essential worker interactions within a standard epidemiology framework. The models were designed to correspond to key characteristics of, respectively, cashiers, factory employees, and healthcare workers. We find in all three models that essential workers are at substantially elevated risk of infection compared to the rest of the population, and that increasing the numbers of essential workers necessitates the imposition of more stringent interaction controls on the rest of the population in order to manage the pandemic. However, different archetypes of essential workers differ in both their individual probability of infection and impact on the broader pandemic, highlighting the need to understand and target for intervention the specific risks faced by different groups of essential workers.

SIP orders have been guided by extensive modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic to predict its future and understand its impact on the population under various scenarios, including different stringencies of SIP (e.g., [1] [2] [3] ).",

A) An illustration of the basic SEIR model used in all scenarios, including additional compartments within the infected (outlined in green) and hospitalized (outlined in blue) classes. 'S' is susceptible, 'E' is exposed, 'I' is infected, 'H' is hospitalized, 'D' is dead, and 'R' is recovered. Within the infected class, individuals can be asymptomatic 'I A ' and destined to recover; symptomatic 'I R ' but destined to recover; or symptomatic 'I H ' and destined to be hospitalized. Within the hospital, individuals either go to recovery 'H R ' or go to critical care 'H c '. For those in critical care, individuals either die 'C D ' or go on to the recovered class 'C R ', with an additional time spent in the hospital 'L'. B) To model the impact of EWs, who make up a proportion f of the total population, we cloned the SEIR model. Here, for visualization, the infectious and hospitalized classes are collapsed into a single compartment. The \u03b2 terms represent the transmission routes between infectious individuals within and between essential 'E' and non-essential 'N' groups.

However even before SIP, healthcare workers bear a proportionally larger burden of the epidemic due to within-hospital infections.

After SIP, EWs bear a proportionally larger burden of the epidemic and this fraction increases. Under the public-facing worker model, the rate of contact between EWs and nEWs isn't reduced by SIP, mitigating divergence in the rate of infection in the two subpopulations. In the non-public facing and healthcare worker models, SIP largely decouples t he epidemic between EWs and nEW. Thus, the increased infection rate among EWs does not cause substantially more infections among nEWs, resulting in EWs comprising a disproportionately large proportion of the infections (i.e.,",

Before SIP, the most infections spread among nEWs, as they constitute the vast majority of the population. After SIP, we would naively expect a reduction in infections stemming from interaction terms that are reduced by SIP. Indeed, immediately after SIP, infections associated with reduced interaction terms are reduced (e.g. EN in non-public facing and NN in all models). However, EWs also bear a disproportionately large burden of infections. Thus after a short lag, as infections among EWs increase, so does their contribution to new infections in both other EWs and in nEW; in fact EWs often become the predominant spreaders of new infections.
