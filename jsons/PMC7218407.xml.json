The lungs are continually exposed to a multitude of microorganisms, some of which are able to persist and colonize the respiratory tract. These microbes that reside in the lower airways constitute the lung microbiome, which is distinct in composition from the microbiota observed in the oral and nasal cavities. The surface of the lungs presents a continuous layer of epithelial cells that constitute a physical and biological barrier for inhaled substances and pathogens. The specialized respiratory epithelium is required for maintenance of immune homeostasis, and epithelial dysfunction is involved in the development of many inflammatory disorders of the airways and lungs.\n1\n The respiratory tract is a complex organ system, and its primary function is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. It is divided into the upper respiratory tract including the nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, and the lower respiratory tract that comprises the conducting airways (trachea and bronchi), the small airways (bronchioles) and the respiratory zone (the alveoli). The adult human airways have a surface area of approximately 70 m2, which harbours a vast range of bacterial communities, with the highest bacterial load observed in the upper respiratory tract.\n2\n The respiratory tract spans different anatomical sites, and the types of epithelial cells that comprise these sites are varied both in composition and in structure, reflecting the distinct functions of the airway epithelial cells lining the conducting airways and the alveolar regions of the lungs (Fig. 1).",

Basal cells are progenitor cells that act as resident stem cells for the trachea and proximal airways. These cells are capable of self\u2010renewal as well as repopulating the pseudostratified epithelium during homeostasis and after injury.\n4\n The tracheal region and large airways harbour stromal cells such as interstitial fibroblasts that aid in the regulation of the regenerative response of the airway epithelium after injury.\n5\n In contrast, the alveolar surfaces in the peripheral lung are lined by flat alveolar epithelial type 1 cells (AEC1) that form a continuous cell layer and are specialized in gas exchange, while cuboidal alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2) act as progenitor cells and secrete pulmonary surfactant, which reduces surface tension in order to prevent alveolar collapse during respiration.\n6\n, \n7\n A common feature shared by these cell types is the presence of intracellular tight junctions that are localized at the apical surface, and are pivotal for epithelial adhesion and barrier function.\n8\n These tight junctions ensure the cells adhere together to form a regulated impermeable barrier. This intracellular adhesion complex consists of interconnections of proteins and receptors including, zonular occluden (ZO)\u20101, \u20102 and \u20103, occludins, claudins, and transmembrane junctional adhesion molecules. Tight junctions control paracellular permeability, and immediately below them are the adherens junctions, composed of \u03b2\u2010catenin and E\u2010cadherin, which mechanically connect the adjacent cells and initiate proliferation and differentiation.\n8\n, \n9\n The presence and function of these complexes can be influenced by cellular differentiation, exposure to a range of stimuli, such as allergens and pollutants, and may be altered in disease conditions, contributing to immunopathology.\n10\n, \n11\n\n",

The airway microbiota in healthy lungs is dominated by the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Prominent genera in the lower airways include Prevotella, Veillonella and Streptococcus.\n\n21\n The composition of the lung microbiome is determined by three factors: microbial immigration; microbial elimination; and the relative reproduction rates of its members. The main routes of microbial immigration to the lungs are inhalation of air\u2010borne bacteria, direct dispersion along mucosal surfaces and microaspiration.\n14\n, \n22\n The similarities in community composition between the oral and lung microbiota suggest that microaspiration is likely to be the dominant route of immigration.\n14\n, \n23\n Microbial elimination is an active process that is achieved through mucociliary clearance, cough and host immune defences.\n24\n The environmental conditions necessary for microbial growth within the respiratory tract (e.g. pH, temperature, nutrient availability, oxygen tension and activation of host inflammatory cells) are heterogenous, and considerable regional variation can be observed in a single healthy lung. During lung disease, the balance between immigration and elimination is perturbed, leading to alterations in the lung microbiota, with bacteria exhibiting competitive advantages becoming predominant\n14\n (Table 1). This overgrowth of bacterial species leads to a decrease in overall richness, and is associated with the progression of chronic lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).\n16\n, \n17\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n25\n Furthermore, these studies have linked microbial dysbiosis with an increased morbidity and mortality in a multitude of chronic respiratory diseases.",

Emerging evidence suggests that the lung virome and mycobiome have a significant impact on clinical outcome of chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD, CF and IPF.\n27\n, \n34\n, \n35\n It is also increasingly recognized that respiratory viruses are a major cause of acute exacerbations of chronic pulmonary diseases, and that the host response to viral infection is dysregulated in these diseases. For example, studies support a mechanistic role for viruses in the initiation and progression of IPF. The human herpes virus (HHV) family, which includes cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2212Barr virus, HHV\u20107 and HHV\u20108, has received considerable attention as either an aetiological or exacerbating agent of IPF.\n36\n In asthma, infection by respiratory viruses is a major trigger of wheezing in infants as well as exacerbations of asthma in older children. The infectious agents associated with these wheezing events include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus, parainfluenza, coronavirus and other viruses.\n37\n Despite the fact that very little is known about the lung mycobiome compared with the bacterial microbiome, in recent years specific fungi have been identified in respiratory diseases.\n38\n, \n39\n It has also been shown that commensal fungi can affect the immune system and also modulate bacterial communities, thus contributing to the restoration of the bacterial microbiota following antibiotic treatment.\n40\n, \n41\n Although studies into the composition and function of lung viral and fungal communities are gaining momentum, research in this field is still in its infancy, and future mechanistic work is needed to yield novel insights into their role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases.",

The pulmonary epithelium is composed of distinct cell types and is not continuous from the upper respiratory tract to the alveoli.\n43\n In the large airways, the submucosal gland harbours the mucus and serous cells that are responsible for the production of most airway mucus.\n44\n Towards the bronchioles, goblet and club cells produce mucus, whereas in the alveoli AEC1 and AEC2 secrete pulmonary surfactant.\n45\n, \n46\n Mucus is a gel composed mainly of water and glycosylated proteins, such as mucins.\n48\n Mucins are the large glycoprotein constituents of airway mucus.\n49\n MUC5AC from goblet cells and MUC5B from submucosal glands are the predominant gel\u2010forming mucins in the human airways.\n50\n, \n51\n Mucus is a major ecological niche for the microbiota; it promotes healthy interactions between microorganisms and epithelial cells through the formation of a thin mobile layer that is supported by the periciliary layer covering the cilia.\n49\n, \n52\n In health, the mucus layer provides an effective defence against epithelial injury; however, excessive mucus production is associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections, respiratory allergies, and contributes to obstruction in several respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, asthma, COPD and CF.\n53\n, \n54\n This obstruction hinders the ability of the cilia to transport mucus out of the lungs, and favours the selection of certain pathogenic bacteria that thrive in mucus and establish themselves in this obstructed niche.\n55\n Furthermore, microaspiration is commonly observed in chronic lung disease, and gastro\u2010oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) has emerged as a frequent co\u2010morbidity in chronic respiratory disorders. Although GORD is typically confined to the lower oesophagus, in some individuals it can be associated with pulmonary microaspiration of gastric contents.\n56\n The occurrence of aspiration can lead to increased levels of bile acid in the lungs, which can favour the establishment of microbial biofilms, composed of microbial cells that form structured communities embedded in an extracellular matrix.\n57\n Bacterial and fungal biofilms have emerged as a mechanism of virulence for opportunistic pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcal species.\n58\n, \n59\n A hallmark of biofilms is their remarkable antimicrobial tolerance, which allows them to persist in the host and evade the host immune system.\n59\n Therefore, GORD\u2010derived bile and subsequent biofilm growth on host tissue may contribute to chronic respiratory infection. In addition, direct seeding of bacteria from the intestinal microbiota into the airways may play a role in influencing the interaction between the epithelium and the microbiome.\n60\n\n",

Human \u03b2\u2010defensin 1, 2, 3 and 4 are largely expressed on airway epithelial cells and function in airway mucosal defence by targeting a wide range of respiratory pathogens.

In healthy individuals, this response promptly results in pathogen clearance. In contrast, in patients with chronic respiratory diseases these defences may be impaired leading to increased susceptibility to infection that drives inflammatory responses that in turn exacerbate the underlying disease. During chronic disease there is evidence that this barrier function is impaired, with disruption of tight junctions and increased epithelial permeability. This loss of barrier function leads to the entry of pathogens and other particles. Compromised barrier function is intimately linked to triggering of abnormal repair and remodelling.\n102\n Respiratory viruses, air pollutants and allergens all have the capacity to inflict such damage on the epithelium, either directly due to inherent proteolytic activity or indirectly by binding to PAR\u20102 expressed on the apical surface of bronchial epithelial cells.

Similar to the gut, the airway microbiota in healthy lungs is dominated by the short\u2010chain fatty acid (SCFA)\u2010producing bacteria: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. These are metabolically active bacteria that produce SCFAs via the bacterial fermentation of non\u2010digestible carbohydrates by the gut microbiota; acetate, propionate and butyrate being the most abundant in the human intestinal tract.\n134\n It is now well documented that the intestinal microbiota influences the microbial composition within the lung either by direct seeding of bacteria into the airways or by the distribution of SCFAs. These SCFAs not only act as a fuel for intestinal epithelial cells but also exert distinct physiological effects, acting as a link between the microbiota and the immune system, and playing a key role in maintaining mucosal immunity. Although there are limited studies investigating the impact of these SCFAs in the lungs, in the gut they have been shown to be integral for tight junction formation and to promote anti\u2010inflammatory mechanisms to sustain intestinal homeostasis.\n135\n Indeed, SCFAs interact with immune cells, and modulate their recruitment, differentiation, activation and survival at different tissues.\n136\n The proposed pathway of this gut\u2212lung interaction involves the entry of the microbiota and its products from the airways into the intestinal mucosa. These are phagocytosed and transferred to the mesenteric lymph nodes by antigen\u2010presenting cells that stimulate the priming of B\u2010 and T\u2010cells. Once activated, these cells can then migrate back to the original site or to distal locations such as the lung epithelium where they can exert directly on their target. Another proposed pathway involves the direct migration of bacterial products from the intestinal mucosa to the lungs via the bloodstream where they act to stimulate the immune system. Similarly, the same route is proposed beginning in the lung and culminating in the intestinal mucosa, although the influence of the lung microbiota and its metabolites on the gut is yet to be elucidated.\n137\n\n",

Mice devoid of their intestinal microbiota during early life are at an increased risk of developing allergic airway disease.\n138\n, \n139\n An increased risk of asthma has been associated with a predominance of Bacteroidetes fragilis and total anaerobes in early life,\n140\n decreases in the total abundances of Escherichia coli, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, Rothia and Veillonella bacterial genera.\n141\n In adults, taxa\u2010specific differences in the gut microbiota were observed, such as an increased relative abundance of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, which negatively correlated with the time since asthma diagnosis.\n142\n Furthermore, mice fed a peptide\u2010based enteral diet that increased the production of SCFAs attenuated elastase\u2010induced inflammation and emphysema in the lung.\n143\n The axis is by no means one\u2010directional, with respiratory infection driving perturbations in the gut microbiome, but further work is needed to validate this.\n144\n, \n145\n A study reported that the intranasal delivery of a non\u2010absorbable tracer into the nasal cavity of mice appeared in the gastrointestinal tract shortly after.\n144\n In addition, work by Sze et al.\n146\n reported that intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide not only disrupted the airway microbiota but also led to the translocation of airway bacteria belonging to the Clostridium and Lachnospiraceae genera into the bloodstream and affected the gut microbiota within 24 hr, resulting in an evident increase in total bacterial load. Collectively, these studies provide evidence of the bidirectional communication happening between these two sites. However, our understanding of this cross\u2010talk is still in its infancy, and there is a pressing need to uncover whether these changes observed in the microbiota are the cause or the effect of disease. Furthermore, there is growing evidence highlighting the use of oral antibiotics and their effect on lung immunity. Antibiotics could affect the lung microbiome either directly or indirectly through their effects on the gut microbiome and subsequently on lung immunity. To support this hypothesis, murine studies have shown that depletion of certain species within the gut microbiota due to antibiotic intake influences lung diseases and allergic inflammation.\n147\n For example, microbial dysbiosis due to the use of macrolides in early life correlated with an increased risk of asthma in Finnish pre\u2010school children.\n148\n It is clear that we need to appreciate the interactions between the gut and airway microbiota in order to understand the impact of antibiotics on lung health.",

The epithelium acts as the first line of defence against inhaled viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens. Studies have shown that the epithelial surfaces of the human respiratory tract are colonized by a complex and dynamic microbiota that plays a role both in health and disease. It is becoming increasingly recognized that the cellular and physiological characteristics of the lungs impact the establishment and persistence of these bacterial communities. Dysregulation of the epithelial immune response and barrier function along with microbial dysbiosis can contribute to chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma, COPD, CF and IPF. However, the precise nature of the relationship between the respiratory microbiome and the epithelium in the lungs remains an active area of investigation. A better understanding of this interaction in maintaining airway homeostasis will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of several respiratory conditions as well as novel diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. Emerging evidence, particularly involving SCFAs, has highlighted a link between the gut and the lung and the microbial communities within. These results highlight the need for future studies that will characterize the microbiota and metabolites comprising these two mucosal sites and determine their interaction with the host in order to develop more targeted treatments for lung diseases.",
