In these cases, the operator should try to have a partial view of the posterior basal areas, currently considered \u201chot areas\u201d for COVID\u201019 and, however, start the echographic assessment from landmark number 7.Use convex or linear transducers, according to the patient's body size.Use a single\u2013focal point modality (no multifocusing), setting the focal point on the pleural line. Using a single focal point and setting it at the right location have the benefit of optimizing the beam shape for sensing the lung surface. At the focus, the beam has the smallest width and is therefore set to best respond to the smallest details.Keep the mechanical index low (start from 0.7 and reduce it further if allowed by the visual findings). High mechanical indices, used for a long observation time, may result in damage to the lung.16\nAvoid saturation phenomena as much as possible; control gain; and diminish the mechanical index if needed (see examples of LUS images in the figures). Saturation phenomena occur, eg, when the signal strength of the echo signals is too high for the receiving electronics to be converted into electrical signals, conserving a linear relationship with the pressure amplitude. This has the effect of distorting the signals and produces images where the dynamics of the actual signal are lost. The visual appearance of this phenomenon is the presence of areas that are completely white. In this case, it is therefore not possible to appreciate local variations in the response to insonations.Avoid the use of cosmetic filters and specific imaging modalities such as harmonic imaging, contrast, Doppler, and compounding.Achieve the highest frame rate possible (eg, no persistence and no multifocusing).Save the data in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format. In case this is not possible, save the data directly as a video format. Visual findings, especially when related to very small alterations, do not appear on every frame. It is thus advantageous to acquire videos, where the lung surface below the landmark can be monitored for a few seconds during breathing.\n",

            "text": "\nScore 0: The pleural line is continuous and regular. Horizontal artifacts are present. These artifacts are generally referred to as A\u2010lines (See Figures 2, 3, 4, 5). They are due to the high reflectivity of the normally aerated lung surface and characterize the visual representation of the multiple reflections happening between the US transducer and the lung surface itself.3, 5, 7\nScore 1: The pleural line is indented. Below the indent, vertical areas of white are visible. These are due to local alterations in the acoustical properties of the lung, as, for example, the replacement of volumes previously occupied by air in favor of media that are acoustically much more similar to the intercostal tissue (water, blood, and tissue). This phenomenon opens channels accessible to US, which can explain the appearance of the vertical artifacts.3, 5, 7\nScore 2: The pleural line is broken. Below the breaking point, small\u2010to\u2010large consolidated areas (darker areas) appear with associated areas of white below the consolidated area (white lung). The darkening of the consolidated areas signals the loss of aeration and the transition of these areas toward acoustic properties similar to soft tissue over the entire area represented by the consolidation itself. Beyond the consolidations, the appearance of areas of white lung signals the presence of areas not yet fully deaerated, where air inclusions are still present but embedded in tissuelike material. This highly scattering environment can explain this peculiar pattern.3, 5, 7\nScore 3: The scanned area shows dense and largely extended white lung with or without larger consolidations.\n",

The aim of this article is thus to share our experience and to propose a standardization with respect to the use of LUS in the treatment of patients with COVID\u201019. The article introduces the detailing of landmarks and imaging settings to the acquisition protocol and presents a scoring mechanism developed within our group.
