The severity of COVID-19 can be easily understood by the exponentially increasing cases worldwide. The virus affects respiratory system like other influenza viruses and appears as a major threat throughout the world after 1918 Spanish flu (H1N1) outbreak. COVID-19 is one of the highly infectious diseases with the ability to affect a large population globally and can cause severe impact on socioeconomic stability of the world. The emergence of SARS-CoV traces back to year 2003 from China, and again another mutant emerged in 2012 known as MERS from Saudi Arabia. All the three highly infectious strains of CoV are found to be zoonotic and transmitted from animals to people.",

The strain was completely novel and unknown to scientific fraternity at the time of its outbreak. The novel coronavirus or COVID-19 is highly infectious and spread so fast through people-to-people contact. The emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic viral strains pose immense threat to the human population and need to addressed strategically with rapid response (Menachery et al. 2018). The SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus and is classified into virus family of Coronaviridae. Coronaviruses belong to large Coronaviridae family of viruses causing infection leads from common cold to severe illness and respiratory diseases. As per the studies conducted by various research groups worldwide, the COVID-19 genome is in close similarity with bat coronavirus, and it belongs to beta coronavirus group of Coronaviridae family. The brief classification of the SARS-CoV-2 is depicted in Fig. 11.1 (Tekes and Thiel 2016; Ashour et al. 2020), and some of the major human illnesses causing CoVs are given in Table 11.1.\n\n",

Researchers found the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces and compared the same with SARS-CoV-1. The experimental data under varied circumstances on different surfaces are found to be similar for both the strains (van Doremalen et al. 2020). The experimental observation shows that alterations in the epidemiologic characteristics of both the viruses may arise due to other reasons. The high viral concentration in the upper respiratory tract in the patient and the potential of COVID-19-infected individual to carry and spread the virus while being in asymptomatic condition are some probable reasons for high infection rate, making its control challenging (Bai et al. 2020; Zou et al. 2020).",

The complete virus particle is made up of four major structural proteins, namely spikes (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) encoded by virus genome (Forni et al. 2017). The size of SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins shows similarity to bat SARS-CoV. The important difference is longer length and structure of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and bat SARS-CoV observed by researchers. These S proteins are very crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion, internalization of the SARS-CoV-2, tissue tropism, and host array. This S protein may be utilized as vital target for vaccine development (Menachery et al. 2016; Ji et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2020).",

            "text": "COVID-19 contains the largest RNA genome and has spike proteins which play very important role in host\u2013virus interaction and infection. After entering into host cells, the viral genome translates into two large precursors, poly-proteins known as PP1a and PP1ab. These precursors further processed by ORF1a-encoded viral proteinases, PL pro (papain-like proteinases) and 3CL pro (3C-like proteinases) into 16 mature non-structural proteins, namely nsp1 to nsp16. These nsps perform several important functions in viral RNA replication and transcription, RNA polymerase, RNA-processing enzymes such as poly (U)-specific endoribonuclease, protease, helicase, 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exoribonuclease, ribose 2\u2032-O methyltransferase, adenosine diphosphate-ribose-1\u2033-phosphatase, and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (Narayanan et al. 2015). Additionally, these nsps have a major role in viral RNA replication and transcription. Due to the absence of proofreading mechanism during RNA recombination process in pre-existed coronaviruses strains, it may account to be responsible for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The S gene-encoding spike glycoproteins have the maximum recombination frequency (Ji et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2020). Out of the three major proteins forming viral envelope, S and M are glycol proteins and the E is non-glycosylated protein. M and E proteins are essential for virus assembly, morphogenesis, and budding. The M protein comprises short N terminal glycosylated ectodomain with a long C terminal domain and three membrane domains. On the other hand, S glycoprotein is a type 1 fusion viral protein which includes two heptad repeat regions HR-N and HR-C and forms protein ectodomain-surrounded coiled structure. Additionally, the S protein cleaves into two subunits S1 and S2 and facilitates receptor binding (at domain 270\u2013510) and membrane fusion, respectively (Tripet et al. 2004; Yuen et al. 2007; Fehr and Perlman 2015; Narayanan et al. 2015; Kumar et al. 2020; Wan et al. 2005). Considering the importance of S protein in attachment with host cell and variation in sequence of S protein from SARS-CoV-1, S protein may be considered potential candidate for vaccine development. Systematic assessment identified that 380 amino acid substitutions between SARS-CoV-1, SARS like bat CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for functional and pathogenic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 (Wu et al. 2020).",

It shows the severity of COVID-19 and its high infection rate especially in elderly and immunocompromised or weak immunity individuals. Several pharmaceutical R&D units and researchers are working to develop vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Researchers are putting all efforts to find a solution for combating this novel coronavirus. Researchers across the globe are trying to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by using approaches like whole virus vaccine, antibody vaccine, DNA vaccine, recombinant protein subunit vaccine, and mRNA vaccine (Dresden 2020). Currently, there is no approved vaccine available for SARS-CoV-2. Recently, mRNA 1273 investigational vaccine has been developed by NIAID scientists in collaboration with the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, MA. The clinical trial began at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle, and part of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health, is funding the trial on mRNA platform approved for human trial after its promising response in animal models (NIH). A team of researchers from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, reported high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV (outbreak in 2003) and SARS-CoV-2. This genetic similarity leads researchers to determine experimental data for SARS-CoV-1 B-cell and T-cell epitopes derived from S and N proteins which map identically to SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the non-structural proteins, the T-cell response against the structural proteins has been reported to be the most immunogenic in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of recovering SARS-CoV patients. Additionally, T-cell responses against the S and N proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting (Li et al. 2008; Channappanavar et al. 2014; Ahmed et al. 2020). As no mutation was observed in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and long-lasting T-cell response against S protein, immune targeting of these epitopes may provide protection against COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 (Ahmed et al. 2020). Similar study was also reported by researchers from CFAR, King George\u2019s Medical University, Lucknow, India, in which researchers found glycosylated S protein site as potential target for vaccine development due to the genetic similarity with SARS-CoV and Bat CoV (Kumar et al. 2020).

There are several vaccines under development for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and researches are still going on at various stages of clinical trials. The available advanced technology for virus genome sequencing and global emergency of pandemic expedite the process to develop vaccine at earliest. The potential vaccine may take more than a year to come on the market after getting all approvals. As once the researchers develop a vaccine, it must get approved from various agencies like FDA after which the vaccine is sent to three phases of clinical trial. In phase 1, a small group of people are selected to evaluate the safety and immune response for vaccine. After successful trial in phase 1, the vaccine is tested for phase 2 clinical trial on approximately few hundred people to analyse the dosage. In phase 3, the effectiveness and safety evaluation of the vaccine will be evaluated on a large population. Once the vaccine passes all the three phases, it successfully gets approval from the FDA and is released for use to combat against the pathogen.",

After a decade of SARS outbreak, MERS is emerged as another severe threat and continued infecting after its discovery in 2012 (Stockman et al. 2006). In 2020 coronavirus emerged in a new form and is standing in front of the whole humanity as a severe threat in the form of pandemic accountable for many lives across the globe. The timely containment and slow rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS helped to control its larger impact (Menachery et al. 2018).

Various types of coronavirus vaccines are under research like inactivated coronavirus, live attenuated coronavirus, S-protein-based, vectored vaccines, DNA vaccines, and combination vaccines. Vaccines for combating several animal-based CoVs have been developed and demonstrated to be efficient in averting viral contagion. Vaccines for human CoVs, especially deadly SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and the present pandemic COVID-19, are under development in various levels of preclinical, subclinical, and clinical trials. The study of virus-like particle vaccine in mice and whole virus vaccine in non-human primates and ferrets exhibits immune response against CoV infection, but later on vaccinated animals unveiled immunopathological lung disease (Tseng et al. 2012). Another study in canine CoV vaccine exhibited that the vaccination with inactivated CoV can expressively reduce the viral replication followed with the reduction in occurrence of clinical symptoms and disease due to virulent CoV infection (Fulker et al. 1995). In a study carried out on rhesus monkey with SARS-CoV, inactivated vaccine exhibited effective concomitant humoral and mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV infection. The rhesus monkey was inoculated with a varied dose (0.5, 5, 50, and 5000 \u03bcg) of vaccine and provided with booster dose after a week. Afterwards the animals were exposed to NS-1 strain of SARS-CoV, the vaccinated monkeys had not shown any systematic side effects neither any clinical symptoms. The vaccine in study shows promising results on monkeys and may be further tested under clinical trials on humans (Zhou et al. 2005).",
