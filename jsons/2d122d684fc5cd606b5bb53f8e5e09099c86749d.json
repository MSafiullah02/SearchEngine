            "text": "Wild mammalian species, including bats, constitute the natural reservoir of Betacoronavirus (including SARS, MERS, and the deadly SARS-CoV-2). Different hosts or host tissues provide different cellular environments, especially different antiviral and RNA modification activities that can alter RNA modification signatures observed in the viral RNA genome. The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) binds specifically to CpG dinucleotides and recruits other proteins to degrade a variety of viral RNA genomes. Many mammalian RNA viruses have evolved CpG deficiency. Increasing CpG dinucleotides in these low-CpG viral genomes in the presence of ZAP consistently leads to decreased viral replication and virulence. Because ZAP exhibits tissue-specific expression, viruses infecting different tissues are expected to have different CpG signatures, suggesting a means to identify viral tissue-switching events. I show that SARS-CoV-2 has the most extreme CpG deficiency in all known Betacoronavirus genomes. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved in a new host (or new host tissue) with high ZAP expression. A survey of CpG deficiency in viral genomes identified a virulent canine coronavirus (Alphacoronavirus) as possessing the most extreme CpG deficiency, comparable to that observed in SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that the canine tissue infected by the canine coronavirus may provide a cellular environment strongly selecting against CpG. Thus, viral surveys focused on decreasing CpG in viral RNA genomes may provide important clues about the selective environments and viral defenses in the original hosts.",

Many pathogenic single-stranded RNA viruses, including coronaviruses, exhibit strong CpG deficiency Greenbaum et al., 2008; Greenbaum et al., 2009; Takata et al., 2017; Yap et al., 2003) . Two mammalian enzymes are inferred to contribute to the observed CpG deficiency. The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP, known as ZC3HAV1 in mammals or hZAP in human), a key component in mammalian interferon-mediated immune response, binds specifically to CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA genomes via its RNA-binding domain (Meagher et al., 2019) . ZAP inhibits viral replication and mediates viral genome degradation (Ficarelli et al., 2020; Ficarelli et al., 2019; Meagher et al., 2019; Takata et al., 2017) . ZAP has two isoforms (ZAP-L and ZAP-S); both participate in initiating antiviral activities but only ZAP-S mediates the return to homeostasis after the antiviral response (Schwerk et al., 2019) . ZAP acts against not only retroviruses such as HIV-1 (Ficarelli et al., 2020; Ficarelli et al., 2019) , but also Echovirus 7 (Odon et al., 2019) and Zika virus (Trus et al., 2019) , both being positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses like coronaviruses. In particular, selection against CpG in viral RNA disappears in ZAP-deficient cells (Takata et al., 2017) , suggesting that ZAP may be the only cellular agent targeting CpG in viral RNA genomes.",

Group 3 are all SARS-related coronaviruses from three types of hosts: 1) Rhinolophus bats which serve as a natural reservoir of SARS-related coronaviruses (Li et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2016a; Wu et al., 2016b) and the new SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020) , 2) civets (from which coronavirus genomes with 99.6% identity to SARS virus genomes were identified) (Shi and Hu, 2008) , and 3) human patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.

The association between decreased CpG and increased virulence in RNA viruses is mainly due to interferon-induced ZAP protein which binds to CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA genomes by its RNA-binding domain (Meagher et al., 2019) , inhibits viral replication and facilitates viral genome degradation (Ficarelli et al., 2020; Ficarelli et al., 2019; Meagher et al., 2019; Takata et al., 2017) .

This rapid change in ICpG with environmental change as shown in Fig. 3B has two important implications. First, it suggests the feasibility of tracking certain host-switching or tissue-switching events (which would be impossible if it takes hundreds of years for a virus to change ICpG). Second, many experimental studies (Burns et al., 2009; Ficarelli et al., 2020; Odon et al., 2019; Trus et al., 2019; Tulloch et al., 2014) Fifth, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell is ACE2 (angiotensin I converting enzyme 2) (Zhou et al., 2020) . ACE2 is pervasively expressed in human digestive system, at the highest levels in small intestine and duodenum (Fig. 3C) , with relatively low expression in lung (Fagerberg et al., 2014) . This suggests that mammalian digestive system is likely to be infected by coronaviruses. This is consistent with the interpretation that the low ICpG in SARS-CoV-2 was acquired by the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 evolving in mammalian digestive system. The interpretation is further corroborated by a recent report that a high proportion of COVID-19 patients also suffer from digestive discomfort (Pan et al., 2020) . In fact, 48.5% presented with digestive symptoms as their chief complaint.",

            "text": "and 2 do not include all betacoronaviruses from all hosts, so betacoronaviruses from other mammalian species may also possess low ICpG values. One example is viruses isolated from pangolins. Nine SARS-CoV-2-like genomes have recently been isolated and sequenced from pangolin and deposited in GISAID database (gisaid.org). The one with the highest sequence coverage (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_410721) has an ICpG value of 0.3929, close to the extreme low end of ICpG values observed among available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Thus, SARS-CoV-2, BatCoV RaTG13 and those from pangolin may either have a common ancestor with a low ICpG, or have convergently evolved low ICpG values.Other than ZAP and ABOBEC3G, the enigmatic Dnmt2(Okano, Xie, Li 1998b;   Okano, Xie, Li 1998a; Dong et al. 2001), originally thought to be a DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt), may also contribute to viral RNA modification. However, Dnmt2 appears to methylate only small RNA(Jeltsch et al., 2017). For this reason it may not be important in shaping ICpG in large coronavirus RNA genomes, although it has been observed to relocate from the nucleus to cytoplasmic stress granules (Schaefer,Lyko 2010a; Schaefer, Lyko 2010b; Dev et al. 2017) where it may participate in the methylation of mRNA (Dev et al. 2017). These observations allow formation of a hypothesis for the origin and initial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. First, the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and BatCoV RaTG13 infected the intestine of a mammalian species (e.g., canids or human ingesting bat meat). Second, the presumably strong selection against CpG in the viral RNA genome in canid intestine resulted in rapid evolution of the virus, with many CpG\uf0e0UpG mutations leading to reduced genomic ICpG and GC%. The licking of anal regions in canids during mating and other circumstances facilitate viral transmission from the digestive system to the respiratory system. Finally, the reduced viral genomic ICpG allowed the virus to evade human ZAP-mediated immune response and became a severe human pathogen. This suggests the importance of monitoring SARS-like coronaviruses in feral dogs in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.While the specific origins of SARS-CoV-2 are of vital interest in the current world health environment, this study more broadly suggests that important evidence of viral evolution can be revealed by consideration of the interaction of host defense with viral genomes, including selective pressure exerted by host tissues on viral genome composition.",

            "text": "In this context, it is unfortunate that BatCoV RaTG13 was not sequenced in 2013, otherwise the downshifting in ICpG might have served as a warning due to two highly significant implications. First, the virus likely evolved in a tissue with high ZAP expression which favors viral genomes with a low ICpG. Second and more importantly, survival of the virus indicates that it has successfully evaded ZAP-mediated antiviral defense. In other words, the virus has become stealthy and dangerous to humans.The ICpG value for BatCoV RaTG13 genome is 0.40875, much lower than ICpG values observed in all other betacoronavirus genomes sampled from bat species in the genus Rhinolophus. There are 56 betacoronavirus genomes sampled from Rhinolophus bats inhabiting south and southeastern Asia (but mostly from central and southern China).Nature had essentially inoculated betacoronaviruses into various Rhinolophus lineagesand allowed genomic evolution to happen (SupplementalFig. 1). While genomic ICpG values have fluctuated in different viral lineages, only BatCoV RaTG13 has been observed to possess an extraordinarily low ICpG (SupplementalFig. 1). This suggests that the ancestor of BatCoV RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved in a mammalian tissue with high expression of ZAP and emerged with an unusually low-ICpG. This mammalian tissue likely is not in Rhinolophus bats because low ICpG has not been observed in other BatCoV lineages (SupplementalFig. 1). Identifying a virus with comparably low ICpG would suggest candidate host species possessing tissues with cellular environments that select strongly against CpG in viral genomes.",
