These stresses can be triggered directly by the inhaled toxins (xenobiotics) or by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are induced by many of these toxins. Intracellular accumulation of ROS may damage macromolecules including DNA, proteins, and lipids, thereby inducing cell defects or death. Imbalanced redox homeostasis and cell damage lead to inflammatory responses, which further enhance oxidative stress. Cellular factors that can respond to and reduce oxidative/xenobiotic stresses are essential protective machinery against airway pathogenesis.",

Activated by oxidative and xenobiotic stimuli, Nrf2 binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs) and activates a battery of antioxidant and detoxifying genes [4]. Nrf2 also activates many developmental genes, allowing Nrf2 to regulate programs that are related with cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell death, and metabolism [4]. In addition, Nrf2 interacts with many other proteins and pathways, providing a complicated regulatory network for redox homeostasis and other cellular programs. Nrf2 is identified as the key player and important drug target for a number of human diseases including respiratory diseases [5]. Fully understanding the molecular partners and downstream functions of Nrf2 will significantly aid in the development of Nrf2-targeting therapies. This chapter first reviews the molecular mechanisms of Nrf2, focusing on the multiple interacting partners of Nrf2. Next, the molecular functions and therapeutic applications of Nrf2 and the Nrf2-interacting network in respiratory inflammation and diseases are summarized.",

            "text": "The key regulator of Nrf2 activity in response to oxidative and xenobiotic stimuli is kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). As an adaptor of the Cul3-based E3 ligase, Keap1 confines Nrf2 to the cytoplasm through mediating Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation [6]. The Keap1\u2013Nrf2 interaction is mediated by the Kelch repeats of the Keap1 dimer and the N-terminal DLG and ETGE motifs of Nrf2. Cysteine residues (e.g., C151, C273, C288) on Keap1 can be modified by a broad range of oxidative and xenobiotic compounds [7, 8]. According to the established model, cysteine modifications alter the conformation of the Keap1 dimer and interfere with the Keap1\u2013Nrf2 interaction, thereby blocking the proteasomal degradation of Nrf2. The stabilized Nrf2 proteins accumulate in the nucleus and activate transcriptions [9, 10]. After induction, Keap1 can enter the nucleus and shuttle Nrf2 back to the cytosol [11]. The genetic interaction of Keap1 and Nrf2 has been verified in vivo. Keap1\u2212/\u2212 mice die before weaning due to a severe dysfunction of keratinocytes, while co-knockout of Nrf2 significantly rescues the viability of Keap1\u2212/\u2212 mice [12].",

            "text": "Microarray analyses based on Nrf2 activators and Nrf2 knockout mice have identified many antioxidant and detoxifying genes that are controlled by Nrf2-ARE [4, 13\u201315]. Most of these genes code for enzymes that catalyze the metabolism or removal of ROS and other toxins, including: (1) phase I antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutases (SODs), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR); (2) phase II detoxifying enzymes such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST), NADP(H):quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), glutamate-cysteine ligases (GCLM/GCLC); (3) phase III xenobiotic transporters such as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1); and (4) other stress response proteins such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Protective roles of some of these enzymes against respiratory inflammation and damages have been demonstrated by several studies. For example, the lungs of Sod2 mutant mice have enhanced sensitivity to hyperoxia [16], while overexpression of Sod2 in the mouse airway reduces the hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and injury [17]. Activation of the Nrf2-ARE antioxidant pathway is believed to be an efficient therapeutic strategy for redox-related lung diseases.",

            "text": "Recent studies in different model systems have revealed that Nrf2 can target genes independent of oxidative and xenobiotic responses, demonstrating that Nrf2 can act as more than just a detoxifying factor. For examples, a ChIP-seq study combining microarray assays using mouse embryonic fibroblasts with either enhanced or reduced levels of Nrf2 identified around 1000 Nrf2-target genes, more than half of which were involved in cell proliferation [4]. Nrf2 can control adipogenesis through binding to and activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), retinoid X receptor \u03b1 (RXR\u03b1), and small heterodimer partner (SHP) nuclear receptor genes as well as some lipid metabolism genes [18\u201321]. The Nrf2-activated RXR\u03b1 can also control the differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells [22]. In addition, Nrf2 can regulate neuronal stem cell fate through activating genes that inhibit self-renewal or promote differentiation [23]. Another essential Nrf2-target gene is p62, which mediates the role of Nrf2 in the regulation of autophagy [24]. In a human lung cancer cell line, NRF2 activates transcripts of anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 and glucose metabolic enzymes [25, 26], indicating the promotive role of Nrf2 in cancer cell proliferation. It is notable that Nrf2 can target and inhibit some proinflammatory cytokine genes such as IL6 through an ARE-independent manner, revealing a novel mechanism that mediates the anti-inflammation function of Nrf2 [27].",

            "text": "Structural and functional conservation of the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling has been revealed in mammals, zebrafish, and Drosophila [8, 28]. Studies using non-mamalian model organisms provide additional insights into the biological functions of Nrf2. In Drosophila, CncC and dKeap1 (homologs of Nrf2 and Keap1, respectively) regulate metamorphosis through targeting and activating ecdysteroid biosynthetic genes and response genes in a tissue-specific manner [29], indicating a potential role of Nrf2 family proteins in the regulation of steroid hormones. CncC and dKeap1 also regulate intestinal stem cell proliferation in Drosophila [30]. It is believed that multiple developmental functions of Nrf2 and Keap1 in specific tissues contribute to their complicated roles in diseases [31, 32]. How Nrf2 selectively targets and activates developmental genes remains to be elucidated, but it is likely that it acts through mechanisms that differ from the classic ARE-dependent antioxidant pathway. Notably, recent studies showed that dKeap1 can directly bind to chromatin and function as a transcription coactivator with CncC through interaction with CncC at specific genomic loci [29, 33].",

The essential roles of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 proteins in inflammation and chronic lung diseases (e.g., asthma, IPF, and COPD) have been identified by many studies [34\u201336]. It is noted that oxidative stress can co-activate NF-\u03baB and Nrf2 pathways. For example, PM exposures co-induce NF-\u03baB and Nrf2-HO-1 in both mouse lungs and human bronchial epithelial cells [37, 38]. NF-\u03baB can inactivate Nrf2 by competing with the CBP\u2013Nrf2 interaction or by recruiting the transcription repressor HDAC3 to ARE [39]. The AP-1 subunit c-Jun can dimerize with Nrf2 at AREs and co-activate Nrf2-induced transcription, while another AP-1 subunit c-Fos can suppress Nrf2-induced transcription [40, 41]. Crosstalk between Nrf2 and these inflammatory factors establishes a mechanism whereby Nrf2 regulates inflammation.",

The mediator MED16 directly interacts with Nrf2 and mediates 75% of Nrf2-dependent transcription [46]. CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its cofactor p300 can bind the Neh4/5 domains of Nrf2. It was observed that p300 and Nrf2 can be co-recruited to ARE in response to oxidative stress [47, 48]. The Nrf2\u2013CBP interaction can be regulated by a Cl\u2212/HCO3\u2212 channel protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which also interacts with Nrf2 and promotes Nrf2-dependent transcription in human bronchial epithelial cells [49]. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) can dimerize with Nrf2 at ARE and co-activate HO-1 [50]. Formation of the ATF3-Nrf2 dimer can compete with the Nrf2\u2013CBP interaction at ARE and suppress Nrf2-induced transcription [51]. On the other hand, ATF3 depletion in human bronchoalveolar epithelial cells enhances NRF2 degradation through KEAP1 and DJ-1 pathways [52]. Therefore, ATF3 can either positively or negatively control Nrf2 activity.",

Nrf2 can be directly phosphorylated by PKC and MAP kinases [65, 66]. How this phosphorylation controls Nrf2 function remains to be elucidated. ERK/MAPK is required for the oxidative-induced NRF2 nuclear localization in HepG2 cells [67]. However, another study indicates that phosphorylation of Nrf2 by MAPK at multiple sites only moderately enhances Nrf2 nuclear accumulation [66]. The p38 MAPK inhibits Nrf2-mediated HO-1 expression in HepG2 and MEF cells [68, 69]. In C. elegans, phosphorylation of the Nrf2 homolog SKN-1 by p38 MAPK or by Akt have opposite effect on SKN-1 nuclear accumulation and transcription activity [70, 71]. In Drosophila, CncC functions downstream of the Ras/ERK pathway to activate ecdysone-synthetic genes in the prothoracic gland [29, 72]. In addition, the constitutively activated RasV12 modulates CncC binding at specific chromatic loci, indicating that MAPK may directly control the chromatin binding specificity of Nrf2 [29].",

Upon oxidative stimuli, acetylation of Nrf2 at Lys-588/591 by CBP/p300 enhances the binding of Nrf2 to ARE promoters, supporting CBP/p300 as a coactivator of Nrf2 in oxidant responses [48]. Alternative reading frame (ARF), a tumor suppressor that triggers apoptosis, directly interacts with Neh1/3 domains of NRF2 in a human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line [73]. It was proposed that the ARF\u2013Nrf2 interaction prevents acetylation of NRF2 by CBP and suppresses Nrf2-mediated transcription [73, 74]. Males absent on the first (MOF), a histone acetyltransferase, can acetylate Nrf2 at Lys-588 and is required for Nrf2-induced transcription [75]. Nrf2 can be de-acetylated by sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) at Lys-588/591, which suppresses Nrf2-dependent transcription [76]. These studies indicate acetylation as a positive regulatory mechanism for Nrf2 activity. Alternatively, since both CBP/p300 and MOF are histone acetyltransferases [75, 77], these proteins may cooperate with Nrf2 indirectly through the epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure.",

Brahma-related gene 1 (Brg1), the ATPase of SWI/SNF complex, forms a complex with Nrf2 selectively at the HO-1 promoter and activates HO-1 transcription through Brg1-mediated Z-DNA formation [78, 79]. Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein-6 (CHD6) interacts with the Neh3 domain of Nrf2 and facilitates Nrf2-induced NQO1 expression [80]. Silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), a transcriptional repressor that mediates histone deacetylation, can interact with Nrf2 Neh4/5 domains and inhibit Nrf2-induced GSTA2 expression [81]. Notably, a recent study in Drosophila showed that depletion of CncC or dKeap1 suppresses pericentric silencing and decreases the level of heterochromatin marker H3K9me2, providing direct evidence in support of the epigenetic role of Keap1/Nrf2 family proteins in chromatin remodeling [82].",

If not treated, ALI can progress into its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ALI can be induced by aspiratory injuries caused by various stimuli. For example, mechanical ventilation (MV) along with hyperoxia is used as a therapy for patients with respiratory dysfunction, but can induce lung inflammation and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which directly causes or exacerbates ALI. ROS play a central role in the pathogenesis of lung injury and ALI/ARDS [95]. Protective roles of Nrf2-ARE-activated genes against respiratory injury have been revealed in mouse models with induced lung injury. For examples, overexpression of SOD2 in airways of mice can reduce the hyperoxia-induced lung injury and inflammation [17, 96]. In support of a protective role of Nrf2 in the lungs, enhanced lung injuries and inflammatory responses to MV were found in Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with wild-type mice, and these responses can be restored by supplementing Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) [97]. Sulforaphane (SFN), an activator of Nrf2, can reduce pulmonary injury in wild-type mice but not in Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice [98]. CDDO-imidazolide (CDDO-Im), another Nrf2 activator, protects the lungs of mice against CS-induced oxidative stress and alveolar damage through the Nrf2 pathway [99]. These studies support the use of Nrf2-activating antioxidant therapeutics as a way to attenuate pulmonary inflammation and damage in ALI/ARDS patients.",

ATF3-deficient mice have enhanced susceptibility to ALI and VILI, which is associated with the recruitment of inflammatory cells and loss of junctions among resident cells [52, 100]. It was proposed that ATF3 can reduce lung injury through inhibiting Nrf2 degradation via Keap1 and DJ-1 pathways [52]. The protective role of Nrf2 in hypoxia-induced ALI can also be mediated by PPAR\u03b3, which can be transcriptionally induced by Nrf2 and activate several anti-inflammatory and antioxidant genes [55]. In a hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (HIR)-induced ALI mouse model, overexpression of Brg1 increases Nrf2 activity and reduces ROS and inflammatory factors in lung tissues [101]. Autophagy plays both a positive and negative role in ALI, and this dual role is suggested to be mediated by the Keap1-Nrf2-p62 pathway [102]. The protective role of the PI3K/Akt-dependent activation of the Nrf2-HO-1 pathway against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation and injury was revealed in mice treated with desoxyrhapontigenin [103].",

The swelling of the airways can be initiated or exacerbated by environmental allergens (pollen, mold, etc.) and irritants (smoke, dust, gas, etc.). In a mouse model, challenging by the allergen ovalbumin increases inflammation and asthma symptoms by inducing the expression of proinflammatory factors and increasing mucus secretion and airway hyperresponsiveness. In these allergen-challenged mice, Nrf2 knockout resulted in a worsening of asthma symptoms, represented by a higher number of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and an increase in mucus-producing cells in the proximal airways [104]. When being exposed to acetylcholine, a molecule involved in asthma pathogenesis, the lungs of Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice are more prone to asthmatic symptoms than the wild-type mice, represented by the less stretch and the greater resistance of air passage through the airways [104]. In humans, a recent study on childhood bronchial asthma in Egyptian children found that children with lower levels of NRF2 in the serum had more severe asthma [105].",

            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is usually caused by exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) or occupational exposure to various chemicals and smoke, and characterized by airway inflammation and emphysema. Emphysema is mainly caused by damage to alveolar walls and enlargement of air sacs, making it difficult to exhale and inhale. Several studies in mice and humans have indicated that Nrf2 appears to play a protective role against emphysema, and the loss of Nrf2 activity correlates with the progression of COPD. Emphysema can be induced in mice by elastase, which is an enzyme that breaks down elastin, a protein that is vital to the elasticity of the lungs. Although both wild-type and Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice have alveolar wall damage and enlarged airspaces upon elastase treatment, these symptoms are exacerbated in the Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice [108]. Elastase-treated mice had a significant increase in expression of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes in the alveolar macrophages. Transplantation of wild-type bone marrow to Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice significantly reduced emphysema symptoms, indicating that the Nrf2-induced antioxidant pathway in alveolar macrophages plays a protective role against lung inflammation and emphysema [108]. In Drosophila, drug-induced increase in Nrf2/CncC activity partially rescued the flies that had been chronically exposed to CS [109]. Fisetin, a plant flavonoid compound, has been suggested as a potential therapeutic to COPD since it can activate the Nrf2 pathway and reduced the oxidative stress, inflammation, and lung damage caused by CS exposure to rats [110]. In human studies, it has been found that initial exposure to CS results in activation of NRF2 in alveolar macrophages. However, in older smokers with COPD, NRF2 expression was reduced in alveolar macrophages [111]. Genetic polymorphisms in NRF2-regulatory genes or NRF2-target genes have also been found to contribute to COPD [112]. These studies demonstrate the importance of Nrf2 in protecting the lungs against oxidative stress and damage from CS while suggesting Nrf2 as a potential therapeutic target in COPD treatment.",

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease that is characterized by progressive scarring of the lung tissue around the alveoli. This results in thickening and stiffness of the alveolar walls and makes it difficult for oxygen to penetrate into the bloodstream, leading to symptoms that include dry coughing, breathing difficulty, and finger clubbing. Although the causes of IPF remain to be fully understood, oxidative stresses that are induced by stimuli such as CS are thought to be a contributing factor [120]. IPF patients have higher than normal levels of ROS in the BAL fluid and lower than normal levels of antioxidant enzymes (e.g., SOD) and antioxidants in the lungs. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury, inflammation, and fibrosis in mice has been used as a model to study lung fibrosis. Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice have significantly higher sensitivity to the bleomycin-induced fibrogenesis than wild-type mice [121], suggesting that Nrf2 plays a protective role against pulmonary fibrosis.",

Rapamycin is known to protect against PQ-induced lung injury and has been suggested as a potential treatment for pulmonary fibrosis [122]. Treatment of rats or mice with rapamycin led to an increase in Nrf2 levels and a decrease of PQ-induced ROS and fibrosis-related factors, and the effect of rapamycin can be reversed by an Nrf2 knockdown [123, 124]. In several in vitro assays, the PQ-induced fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT) or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), both important cellular processes in fibrosis, were inhibited by treatment with rapamycin or Nrf2 activator [123, 124]. Rosavin, emodin, and pirfenidone are other drugs that have recently been proposed as treatments for pulmonary fibrosis [125\u2013127]. Treatment of mice or rats with these compounds increases the expression and/or activity of Nrf2 and reduces the bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. It is also noticed that these drugs can simultaneously inhibit NF-\u03baB or Bach1, suggesting that the unbalanced Nrf2/NF-\u03baB or Nrf2/Bach1 equilibrium may contribute to the development of IPF.",

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-dependent and ATP-gated chloride channel that regulates epithelial surface fluid secretion in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In the lung of a CF patient, the mucus blocks the airways and traps bacteria, leading to infections, inflammation, and respiratory dysfunctions. CF is commonly associated with the F508del mutation of CFTR. It was found that CFTR interacts with Nrf2 in human bronchial epithelial (hBE) cells, and that CFTR\u2013NRF2 interaction decreases in CF hBE cells [49]. VX809 and VX661, the approved correctors for CFTR-F508del, restores Nrf2 phosphorylation and its interaction with CBP [49]. Excessive inflammation triggered by the activation of NF-\u03baB by oxidative stress is highly related with the morbidity and mortality of CF [128]. Roles of CBP-Nrf2-NF-\u03baB network in CF have been revealed in airway epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. Dramatic decrease of Nrf2 activity is detected in CF cell lines as well as lungs and excised nasal epithelia of CF mice [129]. The defective Nrf2 in CF cells is associated with cAMP signaling, and inhibition of cAMP signaling can interfere in CBP interactions with Nrf2 and NF-\u03baB, resulting in enhanced Nrf2 activity and reduced NF-\u03baB activity in CF cells [130]. Combined, these studies implicate that reducing inflammation in CF by strengthening CBP\u2013Nrf2 or weakening CBP\u2013NF-\u03baB interactions might be potential therapies for CF.",

Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice that are infected with RSV show more severe lung inflammation and injury as well as attenuated viral clearance than wild-type mice [132]. IAV mainly targets the epithelial tissue and specifically alveolar type I and II epithelial cells. An in vitro study shows that infection of these cells by IAV increases NRF2/HO-1 level. NRF2 knockdown causes these cells to be more sensitive to IAV-induced injury, while overexpression of NRF2 shows a protective effect against IAV [133]. It was found that a NRF2 knockdown is correlated with an increase in viral entry and replication while SFN-induced activation of NRF2 in human nasal epithelial cells significantly decreases IAV entry and replication, directly supporting a protective role of Nrf2 against IAV infection [134]. The effectiveness of entry and replication of a virus can be altered with the cleavage of viral HA surface proteins, which allows the virus to enter the targeted host cell. It has been shown that an increase in NRF2 expression correlates with a lowered expression of the viral HA gene [134]. Several Nrf2 activators have shown protective effect against RSV and IAV. For example, SFN or emodin treatment significantly reduces virus-induced lung inflammation and viral replication [132, 135].",

On the one hand, Nrf2-deficient mice treated with different carcinogens show increased severities of inflammation-associated carcinogenesis such as the AOM/DSS-induced colonic tumor [140]. On the other hand, enhanced levels of NRF2 or mutations that are predicted to activate NRF2 are found in many human cancers especially lung cancers [10, 141\u2013144]. In support of the promotive role of Nrf2 in lung cancer, targeted deletion of Nrf2 reduces urethane-induced lung tumorigenesis in mice [145]. NRF2 depletion increases chemosensitivity of human lung cancer A549 cells both in vitro and in vivo [146]. Lung tumorigenesis induced by constitutively active K-RasG12D is suppressed in Nrf2-deficient mice [147]. It is proposed that Nrf2 facilitates cancer cell resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation through the activation of the antioxidant pathway. Enhanced NRF2-HO-1 pathway is increasingly seen in lung adenocarcinoma [148]. In addition, Nrf2 can promote cancer cell proliferation through activating proliferating and metabolic genes [139]. In human lung cancer cell lines, NRF2 activates transcriptions of anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 and glucose metabolic enzymes [25, 26], which to some extent accounts for the role of NRF2 in promoting lung cancers.",

For example, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MAF-G have been found to be associated with lung cancers or airway transcription response to CS [149]. Enhanced levels of both MOF and NRF2-target transcriptions were revealed in human non-small cell lung cancer [75]. Co-upregulation of both DJ-1 and NRF2 were observed in a large set of lung carcinomas [92]. Depletion of KEAP1 in human non-small cell lung carcinomas cell lines increases their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, which is likely mediated by enhanced PPAR\u03b3 levels and its activation of differentiation genes [150]. Novel mechanisms of the Nrf2-Bach1 pathway in lung cancer metastasis has been recently identified [87, 88]. In normal cells, free heme inhibit Bach1 activity through Fbxo22-mediated ubiquitination. In cells with enhanced Nrf2, activation of HO-1 decreases the cellular level of heme thus stabilizing Bach1. Enhanced Bach1 promotes lung cancer metastasis through the activation of metastatic genes and glycolysis genes. Another protein that cooperates with Nrf2 in the promotion of lung cancer is ATF4. Nrf2-ATF4 dimer can directly target and activate HO-1 gene [50]. Cooperative activations of HO-1 by Nrf2 and ATF4 promotes fibrosarcoma lung colonization [151]. Nrf2 and ATF4 can also co-activate biosynthetic enzyme genes involved in serine/glycine metabolism, which plays a promotive role in non-small cell lung cancer [152].",

            "text": "NF-\u03baB is an essential factor and therapy target for airway inflammation and chronic lung diseases [159]. Natural products that have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects were seen in recent studies as potential therapies for inflammation-related lung injuries and diseases. For example, tyrosol (a natural phenolic antioxidant) treatment of LPS-induced ALI mice significantly inhibited NF-\u03baB and AP-1 and reduced inflammatory cytokines, while at the same time activating Nrf2 and HO-1 [160]. Oridonin (isolated from Rabdosia rubescens) and bardoxolone (a synthetic triterpenoid based on oleanolic acid) inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway and activate the Nrf2 pathway in LPS-induced ALI mice [161, 162], supporting the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds for ALI protection and therapy. Investigations of several compounds targeting the Nrf2-NF-\u03baB network in both mouse and rat models have shown their potential therapeutic effects against CS-induced inflammation, emphysema, and COPD. These include natural products such as forsythiaside (a hydroxycinnamic acid from Forsythia suspensa) [114], eucalyptol (a monoterpenoid oil isolated from Eucalyptus) [115], platycodin D (a saponin from the root of Platycodon grandiflorus) [116], and isoliquiritigenin (a flavonoid from Glycyrrhizae species) [117], as well as pharmacological compounds such as Sul-121 [118] and 15d-PGJ2 [119]. All these drugs can reduce respiratory inflammation and CS-induced emphysema through both the activation of the Nrf2 pathway and the down-regulation of the NF-\u03baB pathway. In addition, rosavin (found in Rhodiola rosea) and emodin (isolated from rhubarb Rheum palmatum), nature products that activate Nrf2 and inhibit NF-\u03baB, have recently been proposed as treatments for pulmonary fibrosis [125, 126]. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It was found that DMF can both activate Nrf2 and inhibit the NF-\u03baB pathway and prevent the development of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice [163]. Notably, DMF can control Nrf2 activity in a dose-dependent manner. In several cancer cells, low concentrations of DMF activate Nrf2, while high concentrations of DMF reduce the nuclear Nrf2 level, likely through the down-regulation of the Nrf2 stabilizer DJ-1 [164].",
