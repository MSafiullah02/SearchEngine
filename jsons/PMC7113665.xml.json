SADS-CoV can cause severe and acute diarrhea and rapid weight loss in piglets less than 6-day-old. From January 2017 to May, the outbreak of SADS-CoV has led to the death of almost 25,000 piglets in southern China and resulted in significant economic losses (data unpublished). Considering the clinical symptoms of this new emerging virus that are similar to those caused by other known swine enteric coronaviruese in China, there is an urgent need to establish a faster and reliable diagnostic technique for identification and quantification of SADS-CoV (Dong et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016).",

Results showed that the correlation coefficient of the standard curve in this study was 0.999, much closing to the R2 of 1 in theory. No cross-reaction signals were observed for fifteen other porcine diseases. The lowest limit of detection was 3.0 \u00d7 101 copies/\u03bcL, 10 times more sensitive than the conventional PCR. The intra-assay C.Vs were equal or less than 1.93% and the inter-assay C.Vs were equal or less than 1.86%, indicating the good reproducibility of this assay. The positive rate determined by the new technique was 70.69%, whereas that of the conventional PCR was merely 51.15%, further demonstrating the higher sensitivity of the former method. All these data showed that the TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR approach was reliable and sensitive.",
