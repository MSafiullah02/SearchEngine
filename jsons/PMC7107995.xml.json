The daily clinical findings from history and physical examinations and hematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations were prospectively collected and analyzed. In brief, the case definition includes fever (temperature, \u2a7e38\u00b0C), cough or shortness of breath, and new pulmonary infiltrates noted on chest radiographs or high-resolution CT, in the absence of an alternative diagnosis to explain the clinical presentation. Some of the clinical and virological results for the first 75 patients were previously reported [7]. All patients were treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate (1.2 g q8h iv) and azithromycin (500 mg q.d. po). In patients with a known allergy to penicillin, we administered 500 mg of oral levofloxacin every 24 h. As soon as the diagnosis of SARS was established, ribavirin (a 4-g oral loading dose, followed by 1.2 g q8h or 8 mg/kg q8h iv if the patient could not tolerate oral treatment) was given for 14 days, in addition to a tailing regimen of hydrocortisone (starting dose, 200 mg q8h iv) for 10 days, followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg for 5 days, 0.5 mg/kg for 3 days, and 0.25 mg/kg for 3 days) for 11 days. Pulses of methylprednisolone (500\u20131000 mg q.d. iv for up to 3 g) were administered to patients with clinical deterioration. All hepatitis B surface antigen\u2014positive patients were given prophylactic lamivudine (100 mg q.d. po) while taking corticosteroids.",

Skin rash [4], petechial cutaneous bleeding with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and increased d-dimer [12], impaired liver function, subclinical left ventricular diastolic dysfunction [13], and rhabdomyolysis [14] were occasionally reported. One of the more common presentations other than respiratory symptoms is diarrhea [4, 7, 9, 15\u201318]. Our previous report that >70% of patients in the Amoy Garden cohort developed diarrhea showed that fecal excretion may be an important mode of shedding and transmission [7]. Subsequent epidemiological investigation confirmed the importance of faulty sewage systems in propagating this massive outbreak of disease. Retrospective virological examination of stool samples by RT-PCR confirmed the presence of the virus in >90% of the samples obtained between day 14 and 21 after onset of symptoms, which is almost twice the positivity rate of the corresponding nasopharyngeal samples [8]. It is therefore interesting to examine the role of SARS coronavirus in the pathogenesis of diarrhea in patients with SARS.",

In fact, diarrhea has been well reported in pneumonic illnesses other than SARS, such as legionnaires disease [19], Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia [20], and influenza (especially in children) [21]. Moreover, diarrhea is not uncommon in association with many systemic infections. For example, the rate of diarrhea was reported to be 34.5% among children with primary dengue fever [22]. The exact mechanisms leading to diarrhea in these systemic or pulmonary infections were not known, but they could be related to the cytokine profiles or metabolic changes associated with sepsis. In addition to primary viral illness, other potential causes of diarrhea include the use of drugs during hospitalization and C. difficile superinfection, because most patients with SARS have been empirically treated with antibiotics that cover typical and atypical pneumonia. Finally, diarrhea can be the direct result of viral cytolysis, because the virus can grow and produce a cytopathic effect in a large intestinal cell line, CACO-2 [23]. A study of the correlation between the clinical parameters, microbiological findings, and outcomes for patients with SARS with and without diarrhea may differentiate the relative importance of the suggested causative factors.",

            "text": "In this cohort of 142 patients with SARS, only 10.6% of the patients had diarrhea at hospital admission. During hospitalization, 69 (48.6%) of the patients had developed diarrhea at a mean time of 7.6 \u00b1 2.6 days after the onset of symptoms. The most severe diarrhea occurred 1\u20132 days after the onset of diarrhea, with a maximum frequency of 24 episodes per day. In 6 patients, diarrhea was so severe that intravenous fluid hydration was warranted. The diarrhea was relatively painless and watery, as we have reported previously [7]. No correlation was found between diarrhea and hematological changes, radiological changes, use of antibacterials, or isolation of C. difficile and rotavirus from stool specimens. The only significant correlation was that there was a higher virus load in the nasopharyngeal specimens taken from patients with diarrhea on day 10 after the onset of symptoms. The finding that a higher virus load\u2014but not the presence of diarrhea\u2014predicted mortality in this group of patients is not unexpected. In 2 previous studies of animal models of SARS [6, 24], histological changes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and inflammation\u2014characterized by diffuse alveolar damage (disruption of alveolar walls and infiltration with neutrophils and macrophages), alveolar hyaline membrane formation, as well as multinucleated syncytial cells\u2014were found in a macaque monkey model artificially inoculated with SARS coronavirus [6]. None of the monkeys developed diarrhea over a period of 16 days, despite the fact that RT-PCR results were positive for SARS coronavirus in 1 of the stool samples. Similarly, no histopathological changes could be detected in the intestines of the monkeys, despite there being concomitant florid pathological changes in the lungs [6]. These findings suggest that viral replication triggers a different response and thus different functional impairment in the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. A high virus load in the nasopharynx specimens either may predict severe pneumonia, ARDS, and mortality in some patients, or it may predict just diarrhea in other patients. This postulation is in keeping with the lack of significant difference in hematological markers of inflammation or increased cell turnover (lactate dehydrogenase level) between the groups with or without diarrhea. Although suppression of inflammatory changes in the intestine resulting from steroid therapy is possible, the routine use of steroids and ribavirin as part of the treatment protocol did not allow us to control the effect of use of steroids or antivirals on diarrhea. Moreover, the use of steroids has not affected the severe inflammatory reactions in the lungs of persons who have died of SARS [25].",

This is not unexpected, because many viruses that affect the gastrointestinal tract also affect the respiratory tract, and vice versa. For instance, in several studies, rotavirus has been well reported to be associated with bronchiolitis and fatal pneumonitis in immunocompromised as well as immunocompetent hosts [11, 26, 27]. Others reported that respiratory symptoms were found in 93% of patients with gastroenteritis caused by enteric adenovirus [28]. This virus has been found in samples from the upper respiratory tract and in stool samples obtained from these patients [29]. Similar to rotavirus and adenovirus, the SARS coronavirus can multiply and shed in the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract. In this regard, determination of the virus load in specimens from the nasopharynx may be useful for predicting the severity of illness in both the respiratory and the gastrointestinal tracts. From the laboratory perspective, RT-PCR is more likely to be affected by the abundant inhibitors present in stool than by nasopharyngeal secretions. Moreover, the volume of diarrhea varies markedly from patient to patient. This may also affect the interpretation of data on the virus load in stool. Therefore, we attempted to use nasopharyngeal specimens instead of stool specimens in this study.",

In the case of porcine coronavirus, a collection of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) recombinants were generated to study the molecular basis of TGEV tropism [47]. Recombinants of group 1 had enteric and respiratory tropism, whereas group 2 recombinants infected the respiratory but not the enteric tract. A substitution in amino acid 219 of the S protein in group 1 recombinant was responsible for the loss of enteric tropism [47]. On the other hand, targeted recombination of the S gene of TGEV resulted in a change from respiratory to enteric tropism and enhanced virulence [48]. However, no major deletion or mutation of functional significance had been identified by genomic sequencing of SARS coronavirus isolated from the diarrheal patients [49].",

The absence of inflammation, cell necrosis, or microvilli atrophy does not exclude SARS coronavirus as the cause of diarrhea in these patients. For astrovirus-associated diarrhea in turkeys, the animal model has demonstrated mild histological changes, with a surprising lack of inflammation due to increased activation of the potent immunosuppressive cytokine transforming growth factor \u03b2 at the peak of diarrhea during astrovirus infection [50].
