What the aforementioned diseases have in common is a latent chronic inflammatory state that may be associated with the alteration of laboratory parameters that are typical of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In severe COVID-19 patients laboratory markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, Ddimer, serum ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated in many patients; assessed since the 4th-6th day of illness onset, such increases seem to be predictive of an adverse prognosis. Our hypothesis is that drugs belonging to the family of thiazolidinediones (TZD) such as pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, approved for treating the condition of insulin resistance and the accompanying inflammation, could ameliorate the prognosis of those COVID-19 patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders comorbidities. TZD are PPAR\uf067 agonists that act on nuclear receptors, thereby triggering certain transcription factors. TZD were widely used for type-2 diabetes in the first decade of this century and although concerns have been raised for possible side effects associated with long-term treatment, their use has been recently revaluated for their antiinflammatory properties in numerous medical conditions.",

Although several treatment trials are under clinical evaluation, no specific and efficacious therapy is available at the moment (1) and patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICU), for respiratory distress, are managed mostly by means of supportive care based on oxygen maintenance (2) . Moreover, the dramatic situation currently facing hospitals in Europe in particular, has hindered any accurate or critical evaluation of the published clinical data and the therapeutical response of treatments utilized during the China's COVID-19 experience (3). Nevertheless, although initial reports come with certain limitations, it has emerged that patients with previous cardiovascular or metabolic diseases could be at In addition a meta-analysis that aimed to show the prevalence of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, reported that hypertension (17 %), diabetes (8 %), cardiovascular diseases (5 %) and respiratory system disease (2 %) were present and that these comorbidities may be a risk factor for severe patients as compared with non-severe patients (6) . The presence of these conditions suggests there is a frequent incidence of a metabolic syndrome condition and although it is not systematically reported, it does appear that an adverse prognosis is likely when associated with COVID-19. Peng et al., (7) reported that among non-surviving COVID-19 patients, 88 % had BMI > 25 kg/m 2 . In addition, Creactive protein was elevated in most COVID-19 patients (7-8-9-10-11). In particular Creactive protein was more elevated in those who progressed toward worse condition (12) (13) .",

Although the evidence of this possibility is based mostly on studies of other Corona viruses (21) , the similarities of SARS-CoV2 with the other SARS CoV Yu F et al. (22) , suggest it is conceivable that the rapid respiratory failure observed in a number of patients could be due to the spreading of SARS-CoV2 to the brain, either through the olfactory nerve or the vagus nerve. However, the hematic or the lymphatic route should also be considered (23) . Once in the brain, the virus may reach the brainstem and the important cardio-respiratory functions located therein, affecting them with unpredictable consequences. This hypothesis is supported by a study reporting that a high number of COVID-19 severely affected patients reported neurological manifestation headache and impaired consciousness (24) (25) .",

Although, to the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been accurately documented, it is well known that a number of viruses such as H3N2 and H5N1 can enter the brain through the olfactory route and at the same time, antiviral antibodies can directly access the olfactory neuron [see (27) for a review]. In addition SARS-CoV-2 shares a notable homological sequence with SARS-CoV and since SARS-CoV has been reported in the brain, it is likely that the hyposmia could be due to the a passage to the brain of the SARS-CoV-2 through the olfactory route (28) . Moreover, it is also possible that the passage of SARS-CoV-2 into the brain could be at least partially responsible for the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID-19 (24) .",

Pioglitazone showed to have short-term (16 week trial) anti-inflammatory effects by lowering C-reactive protein by 41 % and IL-6 by 38 % in men with advanced nephropathy (54) . Pioglitazone, administered acutely, is effective in abrogating the dysfunction by attenuating neutrophilia, TNF\uf061, and oxidative stress in an LPS-induced model of acute lung inflammation in guinea pigs (55) .

            "text": "Looking at the clinical profile of COVID 19 patients, from one study it emerges that all the progression group had elevated C-reactive protein and decreased albumin levels (12) . A second study shows that in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, among the laboratory markers, D-dimer, IL-6, Serum ferritin, Lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin were significantly elevated while patient's lymphocyte count was significantly decreased at various time points from illness onset (4 to 19 days) during hospitalization (10) . A third study shows that on admission, 83 % of patients had lymphocytopenia while most of the patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein, and those with severe disease had more prominent laboratory abnormalities (56) .Given that pioglitazone is able to reduce many of these inflammatory parameters and considering that the comorbidity of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders are indicative of a general inflammation associated with metabolic syndrome and lipid profile alteration, all conditions that can be improved by pioglitazone, we are therefore suggesting that a clinical trial with this drug or with other TZD should be considered as a support therapy in COVID- 19 . Finally we would like to stress that pioglitazone can be administered in patients that are on statins as it has been reported that the addition of pioglitazone to atorvastatin, further reduces C-reactive protein and other laboratory markers of inflammation (57) .",
