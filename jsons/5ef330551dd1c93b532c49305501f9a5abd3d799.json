This feature of Tcm allows them to circulate around the body for a long period of time and determines their preferential location inside the secondary lymphoid tissues.

Importantly, a more pronounced rejection reaction was against biological prostheses. It seems that despite special treatment of biological material in graft tissues, quite a large amount of xenogeneic tissue antigens still remains (swine valve apparatus). T cells and monocytes become stimulated by foreign antigens that also provoke their migration into donor tissues and in situ activation resulting in release of huge amounts of proinflammatory cytokines.
