As a result, predicting when, where, and how far diseases will spread requires a complex systems approach to modeling. Recent studies have demonstrated that predicting different components of outbreaks-e.g., the expected number of cases, pace and tempo of cases needing treatment, demand for prophylactic equipment, importation probability etc.-is feasible 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 . Therefore, advancing both the science and practice of disease forecasting now requires testing for the presence of fundamental limits to outbreak prediction 10, 11, 12, 13 . To investigate the question of outbreak prediction, we study the information theoretic limits to forecasting across a broad set of infectious diseases using permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability 14 . Studying the predictability of a diverse collection of historical outbreaks-including, chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis A, influenza, Zika, measles, polio, whooping cough, and mumpswe identify a fundamental entropy barrier for infectious disease time series forecasting.",

After re-normalizing time for each disease by its corresponding R 0 -we used the mean of all reported values found in a literature review (see Supplement)-we find that the best-fit mixed-effect slope on a log scale is one and that the residual effect is well predicted by the times series' embedding dimension d (see supplemental figures S1 and S2).

This observation, that Markov chain models of the same embedding order do not reproduce the observed predictability, indicates that either the model structure is changing in time and/or the system has a very long memory, which is consistent with our current understanding of the entanglement between mobility and disease 30, 1 . That the best-fit n-dimensional Markov chain models overpredict the amount of entropy in real systems, also supports our earlier results that predictable structure does exist in most outbreak time series.

            "text": "To gain insight into what mechanisms might be driving changes in the predictability, we take advantage of the repeated, \"natural\" experiment of vaccine introduction. For diseases, such as measles, where we have data from both the pre-and post-vaccine era, we ask whether the permutation entropy changes after vaccination begins. We consistently observe that predictability decreases after vaccination, again with significance determined by permutation test (see Figure 4A .). We also find that the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the symbol frequency distribution changes significantly from year-to-year across the entire measles time series (see Figure 4B .). Critically, because-as stated earlier-permutation entropy is not affected by changes in magnitude, the difference in entropy cannot simply be accounted for by a reduction in cases. Instead, it means that the temporal pattern of cases changes. This leads us to the hypothesis that the distribution of secondary infections, its first moment or R 0 and its higher moments, drives predictable changes in the permutation entropy, . Permutation entropy and contact network heterogeneity We simulated outbreaks on social networks with increasing contact heterogeneity, as measured by the first two moments of the degree distribution, and calculated the resulting permutation entropy. We plot the permutation entropy on the ordinate axis as a function of the distance between the critical transmissibility for each simulation T c = <k> <k 2 >\u2212<k> , where < k > is the mean degree and < k 2 > is the mean square degree. The increase in transmissibility is dual to the network heterogeneity and distance from criticality, which are both decreasing along the x-axis, as indicated in the cartoon. We find a significant, non-linear relationship between contact heterogeneity and permutation entropy, which qualitatively matches the pattern seen in the real-world disease time series. Specifically, lower heterogeneity -or conversely larger distance from the critical transition point to an epidemic (i.e. a large-scale outbreak)-leads to higher permutation entropy (i.e. lower predictability). phenomenon originally discovered in synthetic directed networks by Meyers et al. 31 .",

            "text": "To further evaluate the hypothesis that heterogeneity in social networks -and thus in the number of secondary infections-produces predictable changes in permutation entropy, we simulated data on social contact networks with varying degree distributions or, equivalently, critical transmissibilities T c -the per contact probability of transmission required to cause a large-scale outbreak, i.e an epidemic 32 We find that the distance of the actual transmissibility from the critical transmissibility (\u03b4 = T c \u2212T ) predicts the entropy of the outbreak time series, Figure 5 . This result demonstrates that, as the system gets closer to the critical transition point, from localized outbreaks to a large-scale epidemic, the predictability goes up exponentially fast. From this, we can draw three conclusions. First, coupled with our earlier results comparing diseases with different average reproductive numbers, heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections can drive differences in predictability, which is related to results on predicting disease arrival time on networks 33 and to recurrent epidemics in hierarchical metapopulations 34 . Second, the permutation entropy could provide a model-free approach for detecting epidemics, which is related to a recent model-based approach based on bifurcation delays 35 . Finally, as outbreaks grow and transition to large-scale epidemics, they should become more predictable, which-as seen in Figures 1 and 3 -appears to be true for real-world diseases as well and agrees with earlier results on how permutation entropy relates to predictability of non-linear systems 14 Research in dynamical systems over the the past 30 years has demonstrated that prediction error increases with increasing forecast length 29 . However, across that same body work, researchers typically find that predictions improve when they are trained on longer time series, even for chaotic systems 29 . Our data-driven results suggest that for infectious diseases the opposite is true, more time series data should most often lead to lower predictability. Then, by integrating our biological understanding of each pathogen and simulated outbreaks, we found that changing dynamics, e.g., the shifting number of secondary infections as a disease moves through a heterogeneous social network, can cause the prediction error to increase with increasing data, which is related to earlier findings on the role of airline travel networks and disease forecasting 15 . What this implies is that different \"models\" generate data at different time points and suggests that the optimal coarse-graining of complex systems might change with scale and/or time 36 .",

Our results demonstrate that outbreaks should be predictable. However, as outbreaks spread-and spatiotemporally separated waves become entangled with the substrate, human mobility, behavioural changes, pathogen evolution, etc.-the system is driven through a space of diverse model structures, driving down predictability despite increasing time series lengths. Taken together, our results agree with observations that accurate long-range forecasts for complex adaptive systems, e.g., contagions beyond a single outbreak, may be impossible to achieve due to the emergence of entropy barriers. However, they also support the utility and accuracy of dynamical modeling approaches for infectious disease forecasting, especially those that leverage myriad data streams and are iteratively calibrated as outbreaks evolves. Lastly, our results also suggest that cross-validation over long infectious disease time series can not guarantee that the correct model for any individual window of time will be favored, which would imply a no free lunch theorem for infectious disease model selection, and perhaps for sociobiological systems more generally 40 .",

Specifically, we compute the permutation entropy across more than 25 years of weekly data at the US state-level for measles, whooping cough, polio, influenza, gonorrhea, chlamydia, hepatitis A, and mumps 24 and weekly, country-level data for Zika from Colombia and Mexico 28 and plot the predictability (\u03c7 = 1 \u2212 H p ) as a function of the length of each time series. Focusing first on the predictability over short timescales (Figure 2), for each time series we average H p over temporal windows of width up to 100 weeks with 1000 random starting points each. We find that all diseases show a clear decrease in predictability with increasing time window width, which implies that accumulating longer stretches of time series data for a given disease does not translate into improved predictability. However, we also find strong evidence that the majority of single outbreaks -i.e. temporal horizons characteristic for each disease -are predictable. The confidence intervals inFigure 2show that there can be large variation in predictability across across outbreaks of the same disease, providing a first indication of the presence of a changing underlying model structures and/or dynamics on the scale of months. By comparison, across all models with fixed structures studied to date, e.g., white noise, sine waves, and even chaotic systems, the predictability is constant in time or is expected to improve with increasing amounts of time series data29 . Single outbreaks are typically predictable. The average predictability (1 \u2212 H p ) for weekly, state-level (Zika data are country-level), data from nine diseases is plotted as a function of time series length in weeks. For each disease, we selected 1,000 random starting locations and calculated the permutation entropy in rolling windows between 2 -104 weeks. The solid lines indicate the mean value and the shaded region marks the interquartile range. Although the slopes are different for each disease, in all cases, longer time series result in lower predictability. However, most diseases are predictable across single outbreaks. For reference, the black line is the median permutation entropy across 20,000 stochastic simulations of an SIR network model, as described below.",
