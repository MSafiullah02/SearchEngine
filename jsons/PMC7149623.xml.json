Differences in virulence phenotypes can be qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative variation may be manifested in various ways. For instance, viral clones may exhibit differences in their tropism, such that one clone replicates well in the brain while another clone replicates well in the liver or in the gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively, different clones may spread by different routes, one clone producing viremia whereas another spreads by the neural route. In some instances, viral clones will vary in the innate or acquired immune responses that they induce, or in their susceptibility to antibody or to cellular immune defenses. Quantitatively, for any given expression of pathogenicity, it is possible to compare the number of infectious units required to produce a specified outcome such as mortality or other disease parameter for different viral strains (e.g., ID50 or LD50).",

It was found that pathogenicity would change during the course of multiple passages, and this adventitious finding was exploited to obtain viruses of different pathogenicity. In general, during repeated animal-to-animal transmission, a virus adapts in order to replicate optimally under the conditions of passage. Yellow fever, a flavivirus, produces fatal hepatitis in monkeys; if passaged intracerebrally in mice, it will become highly neurovirulent for mice, but will lose its ability to cause hepatitis in monkeys. However in nature, where viruses have adapted to specific hosts, virulence may vary from high (rabies in raccoons or foxes, smallpox in humans) to low (SARS coronavirus in bats, rhinoviruses in humans). Similarly, complex experimental passage of a strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) led to a neurovirulent strain that is less capable of causing immunodeficiency, but can be used to study neurovirulence when co-inoculated with an immunodeficiency causing virus.",

The frequency of reversion to virulence is inversely proportional to the number of discrete attenuating mutations.\u2022Reversion to virulence of an attenuated variant can involve back mutation at the genetic site of attenuation, but can also be produced by compensatory mutations at a different site in the same protein or even in another viral protein.\u2022Attenuating mutations are often host range alterations that affect replication in some cells or tissues but not others.\u2022Although many attenuated viral variants have been identified, only in a relatively few instances has the mechanism been identified at a biochemical or structural level.\n",

Macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1 use the CD4 primary receptor very efficiently; an ability required to infect macrophages as they express CD4 at much lower levels than lymphocytes. Most primary isolates of HIV-1 use only the CCR5 co-receptor and therefore cannot infect T cell lines that express only the CXCR4 co-receptor.

For example, SIVcpz of chimpanzees was acquired from African monkeys, but underwent key genetic changes to circumvent the intrinsic antiviral proteins encoded in the chimpanzee genome.

The virulence phenotype also may be qualitative, involving differences in the tropism of different viral variants. Wild-type isolates of a virus may vary in virulence, and virulence variants can also be selected by experimental manipulation. Attenuated variants often exhibit host range or temperature-sensitive phenotypes, and may provide candidates for live virus vaccines. The attenuated phenotype can be manifested at any step during the course of infection, from invasion, to spread, involvement of target organs, or shedding. Virulence or attenuation can be mapped to specific viral genes and individual nucleotides, and may be associated with one or many viral genes, including noncoding sequences. For viruses with large and complex genomes, virulence may be conferred by accessory genes that act as virokines or viroceptors.",

In persistent infections there is a delicate balance, so that the host is not killed by the destructive effects of the virus and the virus manages to evade immune surveillance. Most persistent infections fall into one of three distinct patterns. (1) Persistence of the virus\u2014usually a noncytocidal agent\u2014at high titer in various tissues, often associated with immune tolerance due to deletion or exhaustion of antigen-specific T lymphocytes. (2) Latent infections, in which the virus persists as an untranslated genome that eludes recognition by the host immune response; Latent infections may reactivate periodically and reactivations are usually terminated by host immune surveillance. (3) Smoldering infections fall between the other two patterns, with the virus continuing to replicate but at a low level in the face of a brisk immune response. Evasion of immune surveillance is achieved by a number of mechanisms, such as immunologically privileged tissue sites, intercellular bridges, and antigenic variation. Persistent infections may be asymptomatic but often are associated with a wide variety of chronic diseases. As we will see in the following chapter, some persistent viral infections can also lead to cancer.\n",

In the low replicative phase, patients may control or clear the infection with the development of anti-HBe antibody and recovery of cellular immunity. In the immunoactive or high replicative phases, the immune response attempts to clear the virus but is only partially successful, with resultant necroinflammatory hepatitis that may progress to cirrhosis (permanent liver damage).
