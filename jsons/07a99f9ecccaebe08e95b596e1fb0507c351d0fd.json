Random-effects models were adopted to estimate the overall relative risk. Fourteen articles involving more than 19000 COVID-19 cases were included. Our results showed that ACEI/ARB exposure is not associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection (OR=0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.04; P=0.672). Among those with COVID-19 infection, ACEI/ARB exposure is not associated with a higher risk of severity (OR=0.98; 95%CI 0.87-1.09; P=0.69) or mortality (OR=0.73, 95%CI 0.5-1.07; P=0.111). However, ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with a lower risk of mortality compared those with non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive drugs (OR=0.48, 95% CI 0.29-0.81; P=0.006). In conclusion, current evidence did not confirm previous concern regarding a harmful role of ACEI/ARB in COVID-19 patients.

            "text": "The latest systematic review reported that hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) was associated with a higher risk of severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 (6) . However, patients with these comorbidities are likely treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which could upregulate the expression of ACE2 receptor in animal-based studies (7, 8) . Because ACE2 is used by coronaviruses as a functional receptor for their entrance into the cells (9) , there is concern about the potential of an increased risk of COVID-19 positive among those with ACEI/ARB use (10) . Conversely, there evidence from various acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) animal models that exogenous ACE2 supplementation can reduce inflammation and increase oxygenation (11) . Epidemiological studies also observed ACEI/ARB use may reduce the risk of pneumonia in general population(12, 13). These observations have led to concerns that whether ACEI/ARB exposure is associated with the risk or progress of COVID-19. In order to provide more accurate evidences on this topic, we searched the relevant literatures and conducted a meta-analysis. Thus, the aims of the present study were as follows: (1) to determine whether use of ACRI/ARB is associated with an increase in likelihood of viral infectivity; (2) to investigate whether there are differences in severity and mortality between ACRI/ARB users and non-ACRI/ARB users; (3) and, in particular, to evaluate whether ACRI/ARB exposure was associated J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f with a lower risk of mortality when compared to non-ACRI/ARB antihypertensive drug exposure. Our findings provide vital guidance for current clinical work on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infection.",

However, ACEI/ARB was widely used among these patients, which raises the concerns about the potential advantages and disadvantages of ACEI/ARB use (33) . SARS-CoV-2 binds to the extracellular domain of the transmembrane ACE2 receptor to gain entry into host cells (9) . While ACEI and ARB have been shown to upregulate ACE2 expression in animal studies (7, 8) , it is reasonable to hypothesize that hypertensive patients taking these drugs may have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Contrary to this hypothesis, our analysis did not provide evidence that patients should stop or substitute the ACEI or ARB medications previously prescribed. This may be result for two reasons. First, the effects of ACEI/ARB on the level of human plasma ACE2 are inconsistent (34) , and no studies evaluate their effect on lung-specific expression of ACE2 (35) . To be relevant in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effect on ACE2 would need to be present on respiratory epithelium. Second, beta blockers are identified to prevent the ACE2 activity (36) , which could underestimate the risk of ACEI/ARB-associated COVID-19.",
