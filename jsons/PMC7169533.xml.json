Great achievements in understanding and controlling SARS were undertaken during the first years after the outbreak. On this basis, the development of diagnostic tests, antivirals and vaccines were initiated. However, it is argued that there is a lack of screening tests for proven effective treatment regimes [4]. Moreover, the pathogenesis of SARS is not understood in detail. Innate immunity is the first line of defence against viral infections and also plays a critical role in SARS\u2010CoV clearance and immune evasion [5] warranting further study of innate immune mechanisms of the disease development.",

            "text": "Surfactant protein D (SP\u2010D) is a member of the collectin family of proteins participating in innate immune responses. This family consists of pulmonary collectins SP\u2010A and SP\u2010D as well as mannose\u2010binding lectin (MBL). Termed collectins, for collagen\u2010like lectin, the primary function of these proteins is anti\u2010microbial clearance through direct agglutination and opsonization, and modulation of inflammatory cells like alveolar macrophages, T cells and dendritic cells [6, 7, 8]. SP\u2010D is recognized to modulate the antigen presentation to specific major histocompatibility complex class II T\u2010cell hybridomas in vitro in a dose\u2010dependent fashion. However, the direction of the effect may be tissue specific [9, 10]. SP\u2010D is involved in the clearance of virus, such as influenza A virus [11, 12] and HIV [8]. Both MBL and SP\u2010D are further suggested to play a role in SARS. Genetic variation in mannan\u2010binding lectin (MBL) is associated with the disease, and in vitro infectivity is reduced by direct MBL\u2013SARS\u2010CoV interaction [13]. SP\u2010D is previously suggested to aggregate the virus through direct interaction with the viral spike glycoprotein [14].",

Potential biomarkers for SARS thus include elevation of several endothelial, coagulation, fibrinolysis and inflammatory plasma markers [18, 19]. This is in line with features of acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Suggested biomarkers for ALI and ARDS further include SP\u2010D [20, 21, 22, 23]. During the course of infectious lung injury, increased circulatory SP\u2010D levels are demonstrated to correlate with human lung function [24, 25].",

The N protein also interferes with the host cell cycle in vitro and reduces the host interferon production. N protein is one of the predominantly expressed proteins at the early stage of SARS\u2010CoV infection and a strong antibody response is initiated against N protein by the host. Recombinantly expressed N protein has been used for the detection of the N\u2010specific antibodies in the host as part of diagnostic testing [26], but the detection of viral N protein may hold more promise for early diagnosis [27].",

Pulmonary leakage may cause a rise in serum SPD, even in the presence of decreased lung production, an observation that is supported by mouse experiments [36, 38]. Systemic SP\u2010D is previously reported to increase within the first 5 days after hospitalization of CAP and afterwards slowly decline with resolution of infection [32].

N protein was chosen because it is one of the predominantly expressed proteins in SARS\u2010CoV infection, against which a strong antibody response is initiated by the host [39]. Furthermore, a comparative study has shown that the sensitivity of recombinant N protein\u2010based IgG ELISA was significantly higher than that of recombinant S protein IgG ELISA despite that S\u2010protein is a surface molecule [40]. The limitation to the use of such an assay includes that SARS\u2010N protein shares some homology with N proteins of other human CoV (HCoV) and anti\u2010sera against SARS\u2010CoV may be cross\u2010reactive with other HCoV [41, 42].

By contrast, inhibitory effect of SP\u2010D on antigen presentation by lung antigen\u2010presenting cells was found in a similar study [10], indicating that the role of SP\u2010D antigen presentation and thus B\u2010cell activation may be highly complex and the relation between the antibody response and SP\u2010D levels in the lungs or in the circulation is difficult to predict from these models.",

Patients who died appeared with low Ig responses, which were not sufficient for the determination of seroconversion using indirect ELISA in the early phase of infection. SARS\u2010specific Ig measurement was therefore suggested as a prognostic marker [43]. The measured IgG level in the patient who died in the present study was also low. The optical density at 450 nm was 0.282 and 24% of the mean.

Although systemic SP\u2010D was increased in SARS patients and correlated with SARS\u2010specific antibodies, SP\u2010D failed to correlate with other measures of SARS disease, including leucocytopenia, thrombocytosis or chest radiographic score. One possibility is that these variables are not causally related. However, potential associations may be weak and a larger study with a wider variation in scores among study participants are needed to investigate these relationships in further detail. Some measures of disease activity, e.g. leucocytopenia and thrombocytosis, may reflect aspects of disease development which are not directly associated with alveolar damage and are not expected to follow the development of systemic SP\u2010D.
