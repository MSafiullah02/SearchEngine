            "text": "Wheezing illnesses occur in up to 50% of children by age 6 years1 and are almost always initiated by viral infections. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) infections are the two major causes of preschool wheezing illnesses, and there are a number of other viruses that cause smaller numbers of cases. Viral lower respiratory illnesses (LRI), with or without wheezing, are the most frequent cause of hospitalization in young children, and unfortunately specific treatments are lacking. Thankfully, for most children virus-induced wheezing episodes are transient and cease to occur after the preschool years. However, some children who wheeze in early life go on to develop persistent childhood asthma. It is important to define risk factors for the transition from recurrent virus-induced wheeze to persistent childhood asthma, to develop new strategies for asthma prevention. This review will focus on the epidemiology and etiology of virus-induced wheezing in early life and the relationship of viral LRI in early life to the subsequent development of asthma.",

            "text": "One of the first large birth cohort studies in the United States to evaluate the natural history of childhood wheezing and risks associated with wheezing and asthma development was the Tucson Children\u2019s Respiratory Study.2., 3. An important finding of the study was the description of distinct wheezing phenotypes that occur during childhood: transient, nonatopic, and atopic.4 Investigators later modified and identified four distinct wheezing patterns: never wheeze, transient early wheeze, late-onset wheeze, and persistent wheeze. Never wheeze was described as never having had a lower respiratory wheezing illness from birth to age 6 years. Transient early wheeze was described as having a wheezing lower respiratory illness before age 3 years only. Late-onset wheeze was described as wheezing at age 6 years only, and persistent wheeze was described as having a wheezing lower respiratory illness before age 3 years and wheezing after age 6 years.5 Long-term follow-up of children in Tucson and other cohorts indicate that children with a persistent wheeze phenotype are at greater risk for subsequently developing asthma. Interestingly, the risk of asthma is not linked to viral infections per se; rather, the clinical response to infection seems to be most important. For example, the German Multicentre Allergy Study (MAS) reported that frequent episodes of upper respiratory illness marked by runny nose were inversely related to the development of asthma at age 7 years, whereas viral wheezing illnesses were positively related to the same outcome.6\n",

It has been validated in other populations,8 and a version modified to include more objective criteria has been used in clinical research studies to identify high-risk preschoolers.9., 10. Additional indices have been developed from other study populations, with similar performance characteristics.11., 12. Many of the risk factors for asthma onset after recurrent wheeze in childhood are related to personal or parental atopy (e.g., eczema, blood eosinophilia, or parental asthma).13., 14. Other factors include male sex, preterm delivery, and a history of wheezing apart from colds.7., 11., 12.\n",

The Melbourne Asthma Study followed a group of children from age 7 years through adulthood. At age 42 years, study participants who had asthma as children were most likely to have significant wheezing into adulthood, with remarkable tracking of lung function and asthma severity.15 Participants of the Dunedin, New Zealand, birth cohort were followed from birth through age 26 years. Over 25% of children had wheezing that persisted from childhood to adulthood or that relapsed after remission. Other factors that predicted persistent wheezing or wheezing relapse in this group included atopic sensitization, airway hyperresponsiveness, female gender, smoking, and early age of wheezing onset.16 These longitudinal studies with extended periods of follow-up suggest that outcomes of asthma in adulthood are largely predetermined early in childhood (Table 1).",

More than 160 RV types have been identified to date.25 Rhinoviruses are responsible for most upper respiratory tract infections (common colds) and, after RSV, are the viruses most often detected in wheezing infants. For years it was assumed that RV infection was confined to the upper airway and did not affect the chest except under unusual circumstances. Initial studies demonstrated optimal RV replication at 33\u201335 \u00b0C, and it was assumed that higher temperatures in the lower airways would limit RV replication. Contrary to these initial assumptions, direct measurements in the lower airways have shown that large and medium size airways are at the ideal temperature for RV replication.26 Furthermore, some RV types, including C-species viruses, replicated equally well at 33 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C.27., 28. In addition, cultured lower airway epithelial cells support RV replication in vitro at least as well as, and perhaps even better than, cells derived from the upper airways.29., 30. Rhinovirus has been detected in sputum and bronchial biopsy specimens after experimental inoculation of the upper airway31., 32., 33. and is frequently detected in lower airway biopsies from infants with recurrent wheezing.34 These findings provide strong evidence that RV can infect the lower airways, especially in young children. The species of RV affects its virulence, because RV-A and RV-C cause more severe illnesses in infants35., 36. and are more likely to cause exacerbations of childhood asthma.37., 38.\n",

However, serious bacterial infections accompanying bronchiolitis are rare,45 and a meta-analysis found no evidence that antibiotics such as azithromycin or ampicillin are efficacious for treatment of bronchiolitis.46 Because of the close relationships between viral and bacterial infection in the pathogenesis of other diseases such as otitis media and sinusitis,47., 48. understanding the role of airway bacteria in acute wheezing illnesses is a priority.",

In addition, several studies have linked the severity of RSV illness to variation in surfactant and vitamin D pathways.63 Fewer genetic associations of RV-induced wheezing have been identified. A study of infants hospitalized for their first episode of wheezing identified viral etiology and observed these infants for 2 years to assess recurrent wheezing. Investigators found that recurrent wheezing after RV bronchiolitis was associated with IL4RA, IL4RG, and MAP3K1 polymorphisms.56 Finally, polymorphisms in the 17q12 region have been strongly linked to RV wheezing illnesses and to childhood asthma. In the Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) birth cohort study, there was an interaction between these outcomes; 17q12 genotype was strongly related to asthma, but only in children who had experienced RV wheezing illnesses in the first 3 years of life.64\n",

Children growing up in poor urban neighborhoods have different exposures, with high rates of cockroach allergens, stress and violence, and pollutants. Even so, high-level exposure to microbes in house dust in the first year of life is associated with a reduced risk of atopy and atopic wheeze.66 Children with the lowest risk of atopic wheeze are those who have increased exposure to both microbes and allergens.66 These findings suggest that environmental microbial exposures in early life could be important in modifying the immune response to respiratory infections, either directly or indirectly through effects on atopy.",

For example, Sigurs and colleagues conducted a case\u2013cohort study of 93 Swedish children hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis in infancy and 47 matched control children. Those with early RSV bronchiolitis were found to have recurrent wheezing or asthma, allergic sensitization, airway obstruction, and airway hyperreactivity in early adolescence.76 This same group of children were followed into early adulthood and found to have an increased prevalence of allergic asthma.77 Relationships with atopy and asthma have also been evaluated in birth cohort studies, with slightly different findings. For example, the Tucson Children\u2019s Respiratory Study observed children from birth and found that RSV lower respiratory illnesses in early childhood were a risk factor for recurrent wheezing up to age 11 years, but not age 13 years.78 Unlike the Sigurs study, there was no association between RSV bronchiolitis and the prevalence of atopy later in childhood. Similarly, data from a large British birth cohort study (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) found that hospitalization with RSV bronchiolitis in infancy was associated with asthma (odds ratio [OR], 2.5 [1.4, 4.3]) but not with atopy (OR, 0.7 [0.2, 1.7]) at age 7 years.79\n",

In this cohort, outpatient RV wheezing illnesses during the first year of life are a significant predictor of recurrent wheezing through age 3 years.19 Furthermore, RV wheezing illnesses in infancy significantly predicted development of asthma at age 6 years, especially among children with evidence of aeroallergen sensitization by age 3 years.85 Similar findings were reported in an Australian birth cohort study involving high-risk children; early life infections with RV or RSV were associated with an increased risk of asthma, but only in children who had developed aeroallergen sensitization by age 2 years.13 Several studies have linked the susceptibility of RV-wheezing illnesses to allergic predisposition in infants of atopic families.86 These findings suggest that RV wheezing illnesses and early onset of atopy are both strongly associated with childhood asthma.",

Atopy appears to be an important risk factor for RV wheezing, but it is less of a factor for wheezing with other viruses.104 Similarly, maternal asthma increases the likelihood of wheezing with RV infections but does not affect the risk of wheezing with other viruses.65 Interestingly, for children who progress from RV recurrent wheeze to persistent asthma, the number of RV wheezing illnesses in the first few years increases, and this is in distinct contrast to the stepwise reduction that is observed in children who do not develop asthma.85 This temporal increase in susceptibility to RV wheezing occurs concurrently with increasing sensitization to aeroallergens. In fact, a temporal analysis in the COAST birth cohort demonstrated that atopy generally precedes RV wheezing episodes, rather than the converse (wheezing episodes preceding the onset of atopy).105\n",

For example, pDCs are potent sources for type I and III interferons, which have strong inhibitory effects on RV infections. pDCs are responsive to allergic inflammation because they express the high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u03b5RI) on the cell surface. Notably, cell surface expression of Fc\u03b5RI is inversely related to the virus-induced interferon secretion.106 Furthermore, cross-linking Fc\u03b5RI markedly impairs interferon responses to influenza virus or RV,106., 107. suggesting that the combination of allergy and allergic inflammation could inhibit antiviral responses at the mucosal surface. In epithelial cells, allergic inflammation and RV infection can induce mucus metaplasia through mechanisms that involve induction of the transcription factors forkhead box protein A3 (FOXA3) and SAM pointed domain containing ETS transcription factor (SPDEF).68., 108. FOXA3 expression in epithelial cells can inhibit antiviral responses (e.g., type I interferons) and enhances expression of pro-allergic factors such as TSLP.109 During acute viral infections, the function of FOXA3 may be to limit inflammatory responses as the infection resolves, but chronic expression in the context of allergic inflammation could instead inhibit antiviral responses, potentially leading to more severe illness.109\n",
