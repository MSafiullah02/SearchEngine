Classically, LRTIs are caused by acquisition in the upper respiratory tract of pathogenic viruses and bacteria, which replicate and spread towards the lower respiratory tract, where they invade the mucosa, leading to inflammation and clinical disease.4 Many of these microorganisms are, however, pathobionts, and are frequently encountered in the upper respiratory tract of healthy children too.5 We therefore hypothesised that a balanced microbial community protects pathobionts from causing LRTIs.",

We searched PubMed with the terms \u201c(child, preschool[mh] OR infant[mh] NOT infant, newborn[mh]) AND (respiratory tract infections[mh] OR pneumonia[tiab] OR bronchiolitis[tiab] OR wheezing[tiab]) AND (microbiota[mh] OR microbiome[tiab]) AND (case-control studies[mh] OR prospective[tiab])\u201d for articles published in any language up to May 1, 2018. We identified 14 publications, three of which pertained to the role of the microbiota in acute LRTIs in children. One study, which focused only on infants at high risk of atopy, showed that specific microbiota profiles were associated with the development of respiratory infections. A second small (n=100) matched case-control study showed that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were associated with cases, whereas no specific taxon was associated with controls. However, the study was underpowered to provide conclusive results. The third study included infants younger than 1 year only, and did not include a control group of healthy children. It showed that Moraxella was associated with less severe bronchiolitis and Streptococcus was associated with more severe bronchiolitis.\nAdded value of this study\nIn our study, we show that the nasopharyngeal viral and bacterial microbiota can be used as proxy for lung microbiota in childhood LRTIs. We also showed the relationship between microbial community composition and susceptibility to, and severity of, LRTIs in children. Because we used a strictly matched case-control design in a cohort of 461 children, our study is the first to confidently show the association between microbiota and LRTIs in children. To our knowledge, the accuracy of the model we developed to discriminate LRTIs from health is unprecedented. Furthermore, the phenotype-independent nature of the associations between respiratory microbiota and childhood LRTIs has not previously been reported.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe complete nasopharyngeal ecosystem has an important role in the development and severity of LRTIs in young children. The excellent accuracy of our classifier model provides a basis for future microbiota-based diagnostic tools, which could have major implications for future treatment protocols. Our data provide insights that could be crucial for establishing optimal therapeutic strategies, including targeted antibiotic treatment. The phenotype-independent associations during acute disease that we identified challenge conventional views about the role of viruses and bacteria in LRTI pathogenesis, especially the dichotomy between bronchiolitis (viral origin) and pneumonia (bacterial origin).\n",

The accuracy of prediction of infection was greatly diminished when individual predictors were used, underlining the multifactorial pathophysiology of childhood LRTIs. The contribution of the nasopharyngeal microbiota, both bacterial and viral, seems to be largely independent of clinical presentation, and even holds for bronchiolitis and wheezing illness, which are generally assumed to have a viral cause.25\n",

First, the accuracy of our model in discriminating LRTIs from health suggests that microbiota-based diagnostics might have potential clinical application. Diagnostics for the detection of potentially pathogenic viruses and bacteria cover only some pathobionts and discriminate poorly between asymptomatic colonisation and causes of symptomatic disease. If a microbiota-based diagnostic or classification tool could improve accuracy and discriminatory power, it would have major implications for treatment protocols. A proof-of-principle study of rapid microbiota-based diagnosis (<12 h) of severe pneumonia in adults showed that such diagnostic tools improve diagnostic accuracy and could be clinically applied.30 If the cost of such technology decreases further and becomes available for paediatric use, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics could be avoided more often, and the most abundant or overgrowing species could be targeted with narrow-spectrum drugs.31 Although our microbiota-based approach has to be validated in independent cohorts, the similar performance of the genus-level model suggests potential for future development of universal or country-based or region-based models for the prediction of severity and duration of disease by combined microbiota and host characteristics. Such a model would potentially allow physicians to increase or decrease the threshold for antimicrobial treatment depending on the predicted outcome.",

Our findings also allude to the hypothesis that there is a universal pathway for the development of clinical LRTIs, linked to microbial dysbiosis, whereby clinical phenotypes are driven more by host (eg age, anatomy, baseline mucosal inflammation, status of innate and adaptive immunity, genetic background) and environmental characteristics rather than by single pathogen characteristics. Thus, treatment decisions should not be based on clinical phenotype but rather on disease severity. This scientific debate is only beginning, and, in addition to confirmatory studies of our results, many discussions among and between clinicians, microbiologists, and biologists need to take place.

Furthermore, the unselected recruitment of cases should have given us a cohort that is highly representative of the patients treated by paediatric clinicians, and the consistent patterns in our unsupervised (ie, hierarchical clustering) and supervised (ie, metagenomeSeq) analyses contribute to the robustness of our results. Our study also has limitations. First, case-control designs could theoretically introduce selection bias that could affect the validity and reproducibility of our results. Second, quantitative PCR-based assays detect only known respiratory viruses rather than the entire respiratory virome. However, virome studies report a high concordance between the results of metagenomic sequencing and quantitative PCR-based assays.41 Third, as with any observational study, our findings do not necessarily prove causality. Longitudinal analyses are underway to address the causality of respiratory microbiota in respiratory disease. Fourth, endotracheal aspirate might not perfectly reflect the lower respiratory tract microbiota extending into the bronchi and alveoli. That said, clinical evidence based on conventional microbiology data has suggested that tracheal aspirates are a good proxy for the lower respiratory tract, and therefore an appropriate proxy for the clinical diagnosis of cause of disease in children with severe LRTIs.42 Furthermore, data published in 2017 showed a strong concordance with negligible differences between bacterial microbiota from endotracheal samples and those from bronchial lavages.43 Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing permits annotation up to the in between genus-level and species-level identification of bacteria, but does not provide the resolution of metagenomic techniques (eg, shotgun sequencing), especially for closely related species, such as streptococcal species. We tried to provide some species-level data by using quantitative PCR to confirm four common and potentially pathogenic OTUs, and these findings supported our conclusions. However, future studies might be needed on multiple levels to further confirm our data and refine the conclusions.",

Ellipses represent the SD for all points within each cohort. Stress=0\u00b7269. In (A), operational taxonomic units of bacterial species are referred to by their taxonomical annotations and a rank number (shown in parentheses), which is based on the abundance of each given operational taxonomic unit. For readability, only a selection of the covariates explaining the largest variations between cases and controls are displayed in (B). In (B), the age effect (vertical orientation for younger vs older participants) was roughly perpendicular to the disease\u2013health axis (horizontal orientation), showing that age-related differences in microbiota composition per se are not associated with disease.

In (B)\u2013(F), the x-axis shows the importance of the variable to the accuracy of the model, which was estimated by calculating the mean decrease in Gini after randomly permuting the values of each given variable (mean and SD, 100 replicates); the direction of the associations was estimated post hoc with point biserial correlations.
