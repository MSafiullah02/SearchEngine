Since the first cluster of atypical pneumonia cases was reported on 31 December 2019,1 the disease has spread with surprising speed. While much attention has been focused on viral transmission dynamics and the spectrum of clinical illness, these aspects are not yet completely understood.2\u20138 This report describes the epidemiological and clinical features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) among three members of a family following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Owing to the unavailability of effective vaccines for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2, most preventive measures aim to reduce the risk of infection.9 Despite several recommended drugs, including the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir and interferon-beta-1b, effective treatment options are scarce.2 Hence, prevention of infection is of utmost importance. We provide evidence to support the increasing concerns regarding person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",
