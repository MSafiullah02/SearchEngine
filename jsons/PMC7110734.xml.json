It is made up of Peninsular Malaysia and the Malaysian Borneo, which are separated by the South China Sea, divided into a federation of 13 states and three federal territories including the Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory. The majority of the population is concentrated in Peninsular Malaysia with approximately 20 million people living in this more developed area of the country. The local climate is tropical and characterized by annual monsoons from October to January.",

However over the last decade attention has once again been drawn to infectious diseases, with the emergence of new infections and the re-emergence of diseases previously well-controlled in the Asian region in general, and in Malaysia in particular.1, 2 In Southeast Asia alone, the discovery of new human viruses that cause large and devastating epidemics, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus, have been reported. Unlike some countries in the region, Malaysia was spared from the outbreak of SARS coronavirus and has yet to identify the HPAI H5N1 infection in humans that adversely affected neighboring countries (although frequent outbreaks in poultry have been reported). Nevertheless, in the last decade, Malaysia has been battling different challenges caused by various known or novel zoonotic and non-zoonotic viruses identified for the first time in the country.",

Strong evidence showed that transmission of NiV to humans was through close contact with infected pigs,41, 42 and affected those directly involved in pig farming activities such as assisting in pig breeding and birthing of piglets, those administering injections or medications to pigs, and those handling dead pigs. This led to an immediate halt in direct handling and transportation of pigs within the country and subsequently the culling of over a million pigs.40 Human-to-human transmission of NiV was also described among healthcare workers,43 although this was uncommon.44 The overall case fatality rate for the outbreak reported by the Ministry of Health was 38.5%; 109 fatalities from 283 cases of viral encephalitis.45\n",

            "text": "Genetic characterization revealed that NiV is closely related to the Hendra virus (HeV), a paramyxovirus species causing severe respiratory disease in horses and humans in Queensland, Australia, which first emerged in 1994.46 The full-length genome sequences of NiV and HeV are approximately 18 kb,47 significantly longer than the average size of 15.5 kb of other viral genomes from the Paramyxovirinae subfamily. NiV and HeV also share similar genomic organization, both having increased nucleotide length of the 3\u2032 non-coding region in most of the genes. Taking together the close phylogenetic relationship of NiV and HeV40, 48 plus its distinct divergence and little immunological cross-reactivity with other established genera within the Paramyxoviridae, the two geographically remote viruses were classified as belonging to a new genus \u2013 Henipavirus\n49, 50 (Figure 2\n). This unique relationship between NiV and HeV played an important role in identifying the natural reservoir for NiV in Malaysia. Based on findings that fruit bat species of the genus Pteropus are natural hosts of HeV,51, 52 extensive serological surveillance within and outside the outbreak epicenters was conducted involving various species of wild fruit bats plus other wildlife and domestic animals. Neutralizing antibodies against NiV were detected among the variable flying foxes (previously known as the Island flying foxes; Pteropus hypomelanus), Malayan flying foxes (Pteropus vampyrus), and other species of the order Chiroptera, suggesting widespread infection of NiV in the bat population in Peninsular Malaysia.53, 54 A novel method of collecting free-living fruit bat urine samples using plastic sheets was then adopted, and eventually NiV was isolated from urine samples and swabs from fruits partially eaten by the variable flying foxes,55 corroborating the serological evidence that fruit bats are the natural hosts of NiV.56 Following this feat, serological and/or genetic evidence of NiV circulating among the expansive species of flying foxes was also reported in Thailand,57 Indonesia,58 Cambodia,59, 60 Bangladesh,61, 62 and India63 indicating wide dissemination of NiV across Southeast and South Asia, especially in countries where populations of the Pteropus species are overlapping. Recent studies have also shown NiV circulating in Madagascar located in the southeastern part of Africa64 and Ghana in West Africa.65\n",

The high virulence of NiV and HeV and the wide range of susceptible hosts plus the absence of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions have led to the classification of these viruses as Biosafety Level 4 pathogens.71\n",

TiV displayed characteristic microscopic features similar to those of other viruses in the Paramyxoviridae family: spherical, pleiomorphic, and enveloped viral particles with glycoprotein spikes.72 Serological tests revealed cross-reactivity with the Menangle virus (MenV), another newly described Paramyxoviridae member that caused infections among pigs and humans in New South Wales, Australia in 1997.74 Similar to NiV, evidence of TiV circulating among bats in wide geographical proximity has been reported.64\n",

In these outbreaks, a substantial proportion of patients also showed unusual clinical manifestations, including severe neurological symptoms and fulminant hepatitis.85, 86 Although unclear, plausible explanations for the re-emergence of CHIKV in this region include tourism and migration labor (Malaysia is greatly dependent on migrant workers from neighboring countries where CHIKV is endemic78), viral mutation, and CHIKV introduction into a na\u00efve population.87 Phylogenetic evidence has shown that the contemporary Malaysian strains isolated in 2006 were, however, distinct from the epidemic strains reported in the Indian subcontinent (2005\u20132006), suggesting that CHIKV is indeed endemic in Malaysia.83 Since the concurrent re-emergence of CHIKV in the Indian Ocean region and Malaysia seem to be unrelated, it is possible that other factors could have played an important role in driving these outbreaks. Climate anomalies, for instance, may have favored the mosquito vectors and consequently facilitated CHIKV emergence in these areas.88, 89\n",

Icosahedral viruses similar to those of the Orthoreovirus genus were noted on microscopic examination of mammalian cell lines infected with MelV, and serological studies of the patient serum showed neutralization activity against PulV. Nucleotide analysis of the small (S) segments revealed a close genetic relationship of MelV to PulV and NBV, and clustering within the Orthoreovirus genus subgroup III of the Reoviridae family. In the meantime, two adolescent children of the index patient also developed fever (without respiratory symptoms) approximately 6 days after the onset of his illness. Interestingly, epidemiological investigations of the index case revealed that about one week before he developed the illness, he had a bizarre exposure to a bat that flew into his living room for a short period. Subsequently, antibodies against MelV were detected from the family members including his wife who was asymptomatic. Although direct evidence of bat-to-human transmission of MelV has not been documented, the role of the bat as a possible reservoir of MelV has not been ruled out. MelV is believed to be the first Orthoreovirus associated with acute respiratory disease in the human.92\n",

As of December 2007, a total of 80 938 HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infections have been identified, while 10 334 people have died of AIDS-related illnesses nationwide. Of these, 72% were injecting drug users (IDUs), followed by 16% transmission via heterosexual route (Figure 3a). It has been suggested that the early epidemic was a spillover from Thailand, located at Malaysia's northern border. Malaysia is currently defined as a country with a \u2018concentrated\u2019 HIV-1 epidemic, based on relatively low rates of infection in the general population as measured by a prevalence of less than 0.1% among women attending government antenatal clinics, and seemingly isolated high prevalence rates among high-risk groups such as IDUs and female sex workers. In 2003 it was reported that Malaysia had the fifth fastest growing HIV infection rate in the Asia Pacific region, with the infection rate doubling every three years (http://www.unicef.org/aids/).",

Studies conducted in 1992\u20131997 showed that CRF01_AE and subtype B were prevalent among 81% of heterosexuals and 55\u201392% of IDUs, respectively.108, 109, 110 However, recent studies have documented the gradual dilution of non-recombinant pure subtypes and the establishment of CRF33_01B as the emerging epidemic strain in Malaysia.101 Besides expanding rapidly within the country,111 further molecular epidemiological surveillance has shown that CRF33_01B spread across the border to Singapore in 2005 (Paton NI and Sun YJ, personal communication). Such genetic complexity and dynamicity of HIV-1 provides opportunities for new recombinants to develop and spread within Malaysia and also in the region, thus presenting new challenges to disease diagnosis and treatment, particularly in the development of antivirals and vaccine candidates.",

For instance, early studies implicated the effects of the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon in 1997/98 in the emergence of NiV.119 Directly preceding these outbreaks, Malaysia experienced a severe drought resulting from the El Ni\u00f1o conditions (the largest and warmest to develop in the Pacific Ocean in the past century). The situation was aggravated by the excessive haze produced by the aggressive slash-and-burn deforestation activities in Indonesia. This series of environmental and human events may have affected the natural habitat of the pteropid bats, forcing their migration and subsequent encroachment into fruit orchards surrounding the pig-farming area, resulting in the unanticipated introduction of NiV from its natural host to pigs as the amplifying host. Recent investigations, however, refuted the effect of ENSO and showed evidence that NiV is frequently present in fruit bats in Malaysia, and that its spillover \u2013 from bats to pigs and subsequent transmission to human \u2013 was largely a chance event that might have occurred as a result of increased habitat encroachment and agricultural expansion by humans, confounded by the temporal and spatial dynamicity of both the virus and hosts, and the hosts (pigs) immunity against NiV infection.119, 120, 121 In fact, similar anthropogenic drivers have been linked to outbreaks in Malaysia, Bangladesh, and India, raising concerns that these countries, which are currently experiencing promising economic growth, are still at risk of NiV re-occurrence should unrestrained deforestation and agricultural intensification activities not be closely regulated.",

Although a decade has past, the potential health threats faced by the population are far from over. In fact, the momentum with which these diseases are spreading has intensified over time, as seen by the exponential increase in the annual HIV/AIDS incidence in Malaysia and elsewhere in the world, the temporal persistence of EV-71 infections, the sporadic expansion of CHIKV worldwide, the broad regional distribution and aggressive NiV outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, and the re-occurrence of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry and humans. Taken together, indispensable lessons learnt from the past plus current understanding of the probable circumstances leading to disease emergence suggest calls for better preparedness to deal with impending infectious disease risks.",
