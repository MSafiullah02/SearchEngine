This novel coronavirus has specifically high morbidity in the elderly and in comorbid populations. Uraemic patients on dialysis combine an intrinsic fragility and a very frequent burden of comorbidities with a specific setting in which many patients are repeatedly treated in the same area (haemodialysis centres). Moreover, if infected, the intensity of dialysis requiring specialized resources and staff is further complicated by requirements for isolation, control and prevention, putting healthcare systems under exceptional additional strain. Therefore, all measures to slow if not to eradicate the pandemic and to control unmanageably high incidence rates must be taken very seriously. The aim of the present review of the European Dialysis (EUDIAL) Working Group of ERA-EDTA is to provide recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment in haemodialysis centres of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The management of patients on dialysis affected by COVID-19 must be carried out according to strict protocols to minimize the risk for other patients and personnel taking care of these patients.",

The authors reviewed the whole course of the outbreak emerging in the haemodialysis centre of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, from 14 January 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to 17 February 2020, the day of the epidemic extinction. The authors reported that 37 cases in 230 haemodialysis patients (16.1%) and 4 cases out of 33 staff members (12.1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Dialysis patients with COVID-19 had less lymphopenia, lower serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and milder clinical disease than other patients affected by COVID-19 infection. During that epidemic, seven dialysis patients died, including six with COVID-19 and one without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and hyperkalaemia. The outcome of the four staff members was favourable [7] .",

The aim of the present review of the EUDIAL Working Group of ERA-EDTA is to provide recommendations for the prevention, mitigation and containment in haemodialysis centres of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. In doing so, we have held in high consideration the suggestions of our Asian colleagues, given their significant experience in dealing with COVID-19 [9, 10] , the interim additional guidance released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 10 March 2020 [11] and the World Health Organization recommendation for the rational use of personal protective equipment for COVID-19 [12] . The EUDIAL Working Group will update its recommendations any time new data and evidences become available.

Parents and grandparents on dialysis may want to abstain from personal contact especially with their children and grandchildren, because the younger population serves as a vector of the disease often without showing symptoms. \u2022 Dialysis facilities should provide patients with instructions (in appropriate languages) about hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. Instructions should include how to use facemasks, how to use tissues to cover the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, how to dispose of, preferably disposable paper, tissues and contaminated items in waste receptacles, and how and when to perform hand hygiene. Dispensers of hydroalcoholic solutions should be installed in waiting rooms. Patients must be educated and encouraged to perform hand hygiene at least on arrival and at the time of departure from the unit and if in contact with respiratory secretions. Dialysis facilities should have space in waiting areas for ill patients to sit separated from other patients by at least 2 m. Medically stable patients might opt to wait in a personal vehicle or outside the healthcare facility. Two metres separation between dialysis stations is advisable. \u2022 Treatment and waiting areas should have good air conditioning and ventilation to remove particles and aerosol droplets from the air. \u2022 Body temperature should be systematically measured before the start and at the end of the dialysis session in all patients. \u2022 Early recognition and isolation of individuals with respiratory infection are mandatory: (i) dialysis facilities should identify patients with signs and symptoms of fever, cough, upper airway involvement or conjunctivitis before they enter the waiting room and treatment area; (ii) patients must inform staff of fever or respiratory symptoms before arrival at the facility by phone or appropriate electronic means; thus, the facility can be prepared for their arrival (preferably they should be seen in a first aid department and not in a dialysis department) or triage them to a more appropriate setting such as an acute care hospital; (iii) patients with respiratory symptoms should be brought to an appropriate treatment area as soon as possible to minimize the time in waiting areas; (iv) all patients who have fever, cough, upper airway involvement or conjunctivitis should be screened for novel COVID-19 infection. For sampling, patients should be either in a single-patient room or in a room dedicated to sampling. Disinfection of the room after sampling is mandatory. \u2022 Ideally, symptomatic patients should be dialysed in a separate isolation room (if available), in which a negative pressure atmosphere can be established, with the door closed. Otherwise, they should wait in a separate isolation room and receive dialysis in the last shift of the day until infection is excluded. He/she should wear a proper (surgical or N95) mask filtering 95% of the particulate matter <2.5 mm in the aerosol of exhaled air. \u2022 Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection should be admitted to an airborne infection isolation room and should not receive dialysis in an outpatient dialysis facility, unless an airborne infection isolation room is available. All personnel involved in the direct care of patients affected by COVID-19 must undertake full protection, including long-sleeved waterproof isolation clothing, hair caps, goggles, gloves and medical masks (FFP2 or FFP3 mask if available) filtering 95-99% of particulate matter and aerosols in inhaled air. Hand hygiene must be strictly implemented, carefully washing hands with soap and water and systematically using alcoholic solutions and disposable gloves. \u2022 Consideration should be given to cohorting more than one patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and the healthcare team caring for them in the same section of the unit and/or on the same shift (e.g. consider the last shift of the day). Avoid, however, mixing of suspected and confirmed cases. \u2022 Manpower should be cohorted in separate teams for the management of high-risk and low-risk patients. Only the assigned healthcare team should enter the isolation room/ cohort area, all non-scheduled team-mates should be excluded at all times. \u2022 If a newly confirmed or highly suspected case of novel coronavirus infection in dialysis centres is identified, disinfection must be carried out immediately. Areas in close contact with these patients must not be used for other patients until cleared. \u2022 The medical waste from confirmed or suspected patients with novel coronavirus infection must be considered as infectious medical waste and disposed of accordingly.",
