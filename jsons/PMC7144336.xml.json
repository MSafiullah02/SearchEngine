Most primarily infected patients have been identified and treated in Hubei province, predominantly have close exposure to Wuhan. This is because Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, is the administrative center of Hubei province and the majority of the population displaced from Wuhan have temporarily relocated to other areas of Hubei. But contrary to the initial wave of cases, an increasing number of patients have been diagnosed outside Wuhan and/or Hubei province, many of whom did not have close contact with people from Wuhan. These patients were more likely to have been infected by secondary or tertiary transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Other investigators have assumed that the high percentage of patients with Wuhan-related exposure (indicating potentially higher virulence) drove the severe situation in Hubei [6].",

Therefore, we pre-planned several Cox regression analyses to evaluate the prognostic impact of 1) Hubei location alone; 2) Wuhan-related exposure alone; and 3) Wuhan-related exposure in patients outside Hubei.

Summarising the experience from China and providing in-depth understanding of the situation in the previous epicenter can help to improve the strategy in the current epicenters. For the situation outside of the epicenter Hubei, two studies presented characteristics and outcomes among patients outside Hubei in Shenzhen and Zhejiang, however, the sample size is small therefore, comparison to Hubei patients cannot be performed [9, 10]. To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide study in China investigating the differences in the clinical characteristics and the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 between both those in and outside of Hubei province, and those with and without Wuhan-related exposure. We believe that our core cohort could partially represent the overall situation as of Jan 31st, taking into account the patient number (13.4% of all cases) and the broad coverage (covering almost all major provinces/cities/autonomous regions). Moreover, this dataset showed consistent epidemiological characteristics with the surveillance dataset, indicating that it represented the real-world conditions.",

These findings suggested a potentially augmented infectivity in the general population beyond fragile individuals (i.e., the elderly). This is in agreement with the median reproduction number (R0), which has increased from 2.0 in early studies to 3.8 in more recent studies [11, 12]. In addition, viral genome sequencing of cases from Hubei province and other regions/countries has also lent support to the continuous revolution in the viral functional regions that facilitates its transmission among the human population (self-adaptation) [13]. However, we should be cautious about the bias resulting from the undiagnosed cases in the early phase of transmission when most people were not aware of this disease.",

Our results showed fewer severe events and a lower mortality rate among patients outside of Hubei province and patients that had no history of Wuhan-related exposure. However, these results might have been biased by the temporary shortage of health resources, such as the limited hospital performance and detection capacity, that resulted from the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei. After the surge of cases in January 2020, hospitals in Hubei province were heavily overloaded and managed an overwhelming increase in the number of patients. These shortages could have led to a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of patients, which further contributed to the worsening of overall status upon admission and an increased risk of death.",

Significantly longer waiting time was observed among patients in Hubei province, whereas patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure shared similar waiting time outside of Hubei province. Importantly, we have found that the prolonged waiting time, rather than the geographic location or the Wuhan-related exposure history, predicted the clinical prognosis of COVID-19. We speculated that some patients from Wuhan travelled to other cities outside of Hubei province seeking more timely treatment. These patients reported a similar waiting time and medical care records, which translated into a similar prognosis with the local residents. Consistently, the incidence of severe cases and mortality continuously decreased (figure S1) since clinicians, nurses, and medical instruments have been dispatched to Hubei province. On the other hand, timely screening of candidates with suspected symptoms or contact with confirmed cases might help promptly initiate medical care, thus preventing further spreading of the disease.",

Second, the date of symptom onset is self-report based, bias from patient recall might exist. Third, we cannot evaluate the exact healthcare capacity of each hospital but used a duration from symptom onset to admission as an indirect measure. Fourth, only a small proportion of patients had Wuhan exposure history, which may give a non-balanced result with some possible bias. Fifth, some other factors that may have impact on the prognosis, e.g. secondary infection, cannot be evaluated in this study. In addition, a significant proportion of people infected by the SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic and were not included in this study of hospitalised patients, the situation in the general infected population requires further studies.",
