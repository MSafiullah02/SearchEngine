It also would be possible to set t 0 on the basis of cases. We tried that out to see if it mattered, but rather than starting the count after the first case in the state, as customarily in these types of the analyses, we started it after the first 50 cases had been reported.

From a theoretical perspective, we found that the decision to issue the state-at-home order reflects the classical psychophysical Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics. The signals -cases and deaths -are strongly correlated with the decision to announce the stay-at-home order. Here, for each doubling of the number of cases beyond 50 or deaths beyond 1, additional four to six governors will issue the stay-at-home order. When the signal is truly strong -more than about 250 deaths or 16,000 cases in our analysis-the probability of issuing state-at-home order approaches nearcertainty.",

The percentages of variance accounted for are quite high (60-80%) by industry standards, The typical R 2 for a one-variable predictor in judgment research is between 5% to 30%. This appears to be another instance of a familiar phenomenon; when there are not clearly articulated 1 0 rules to follow, people rely upon simple heuristics 10 of which they need not be aware. These powerful rule-of-thumb, decision-making strategies can surprisingly be more accurate than complex statistical models, but sometimes can be disastrously wrong. 10 Here the heuristic is to wait until the day that the number of cases or deaths is striking. Indeed, it has been suggested that Weber-Fechner law can also operate as a heuristic -heuristic based on the prominent numbers defined as the powers of ten, their doubles, and their halves [e.g., 1,2, 5, 10, 20, 50, The major limitation of our approach is that it does not incorporate the kind of informationperhaps political stance, perhaps personality characteristics, perhaps availability of advice from colleagues or agencies -that might enable us to predict how many doublings in the numbers of deaths a particular governor needs to observe before taking action. Of course, our analysis demonstrated association between stimuli (cases, deaths) and the decision to issue a stay-athome order, but not direct causation between the two. We have identified the stimulus that underlies the decision, but we do not know why some governors acted more quickly than others.",

Perhaps, crossing one of these psychologically important numbers-for example, more than 200 deaths may move the governors in that direction. There are, however, exceptions, as not all people employed this heuristic. The more proactive governors-the four who issued stay-at-home orders before any deaths were observed in their jurisdiction-seemed to have acted on the number of cases alone. And while the seven recalcitrant governors who did not issue orders may be waiting for an even stronger signal, it is also possible that their decisions are based on considerations of a completely different nature.",
