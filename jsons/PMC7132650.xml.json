Of the approximately 1,400 known human pathogens, 58% are zoonotic, including 73% of the 117 that meet the definition for emerging or re-emerging infectious pathogens.14 Importantly, all of the pathogens that are the focus of this article are zoonotic. A more complete list of pathogens considered to have emerged via a species jump have been published.15 Karesh et al have reviewed how zoonotic diseases result from natural pathogen ecology and how other circumstances, such as animal production, extraction of natural resources, and antimicrobial application, change the dynamics of disease exposure to human beings.16 The stages in emergence of pandemic zoonotic diseases have also been reviewed.17, 18, 19 Morse et al described 3 stages in emergence of zoonotic diseases: (1) pre-emergence (encroachment into wildlife habitat and change in land use); (2) localized emergence (expansion of the wildlife\u2013human being interface, for example Ebola virus); and (3) pandemic emergence (international travel, for example SARS, HIV and AIDS).18 Pike et al described 5 stages in zoonotic disease emergence: (1) exclusive to animals; (2) primary human infections only; (3) limited human-to-human transmission; (4) sustained human-to-human transmission; and (5) exclusive to humans.17\n",

These diseases are of infection control importance because they are spread person-to-person (HIV, SARS, monkeypox, MERS, and EVD), health care personnel (HCP) may be at substantial risk of acquiring infection during patient care (HIV, SARS, monkeypox, MERS, and Ebola), they may be transmitted by blood transfusions (HIV, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and West Nile virus), or they have the potential to cause outbreaks in health care facilities (Legionella, SARS, MERS, and EVD). Screening of donated blood has largely eliminated transmission of HIV and West Nile via blood transfusions. Interestingly, although most of the emerging diseases are endemic in lesser developed countries, 5 developed countries (United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and Germany) accounted for the most reports of emerging disease events.29\n",

First, inadequate screening procedures when patients enter a health care facility can potentially allow transmission from an ill patient to HCP, other patients, or visitors. Second, inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) or inadequate training of HCP in proper donning and doffing procedures can increase the risk of exposure for HCP.",

Transmission of Lassa virus to humans occurs most commonly through ingestion or inhalation of the virus. Mastomys rodents shed the virus in urine and droppings, and direct contact with these materials through touching soiled objects, eating contaminated food, or exposure to nonintact skin can lead to infection. Person-to-person transmission may occur after exposure to virus in the blood, tissue, secretions, or excretions of a Lassa virus\u2013infected individual.

Handwashing was shown to be protective in multiple studies.81\n",
