            "text": "Hsieh VC-R. 1 had mentioned some important actions of the Taiwanese government that had helped the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic control. Countries around the world accept travelers from different countries and how to deal with them is an important issue in epidemic control. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Taiwan government had imposed many regulations for the passengers coming to Taiwan. Taiwan had banned the entry of foreign nationals and put the Taiwanese who enter Taiwan under home quarantine for 14 days upon arrival beginning March 19. 2 This bold act had proven to be successful. As of April 17, 2020, Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) had announced no new cases and the situation seems to be under control. However, home quarantine and successful application of that had required more actions from the government. Brooks et al. 3 mentioned the stressors of the psychological impact of quarantine are as follows: frustration, longer quarantine duration, boredom, infection fears, inadequate information, inadequate supplies, financial loss, and finally stigma. To control some of these stressors, Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) of Taiwan started to accept compensations of 1000 NTD per day applications from the quarantine or isolation subjects from March 23, 2020 and from the Caregivers from March 31, 2020. 4 This act might in part reduce two of these stressors: the financial loss and inadequate supplies. On the other hand, holding daily press conferences can deal with the other stressor, inadequate information and also reduce the infection fear. However, to control the other stressors, the Taiwan government needs to allocate some budget to educate the affected people and deal with the frustration and stigma that the quarantine might cause.",
