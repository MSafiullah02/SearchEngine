            "text": "The structure of the HEF trimer is shown in Fig. 1. The HEF monomer is composed of three domains: an elongated stem (red in Fig. 2a) active in membrane fusion (F), a receptor-destroying esterase domain (E) (green in Fig. 2a), and a receptor-binding domain (R) (blue in Fig. 2a). Two of these compact domains are made from non-contiguous segments of amino-acid sequence (Fig. 2b): the stem domain F consists of the amino-terminal amino acids 1\u201340 and carboxy-terminal residues 367\u2013432 of HEF1 and all of HEF2 (labelled F1, F2, F3 in Fig. 2a, b); the esterase domain E consists of HEF1 segments comprising residues 41\u2013150, which precede the receptor domain, and residues 311\u2013366, which follow R (labelled E1, E\u2032 and E2 in Fig. 2a, b). The single-segment R domain is inserted into a surface loop of the esterase domain, and the esterase domain is inserted into a surface loop near the top of the stem domain F (Fig. 2c). The R and E domains of HEF are both compact, having their N and C termini within a few angstr\u00f6ms of each other, so that they can be accommodated into a pre-existing protein at surface loops without disrupting either protein's structure or function.",

Nevertheless, both the overall structure (compare Fig. 2a and d) and the detailed folds of individual segments (Fig. 2a) of HEF and HA are remarkably similar. This is true for the globular R domain, as well as for the highly extended segments F1 and F2 (Fig. 2a), and for the similar helical-hairpin and membrane-proximal five-stranded \u03b2-sheet forming HEF2 and HA2 (F3 in Fig. 2a). Two of the segments of the enzyme domain, E1 and E2, are not found in HA (compare Fig. 2b and e), which is consistent with its lack of enzyme activity. If the E\u2032 domain of HA is a vestigial fragment of E, then HA may have evolved by the deletion of segments E1 and E2 from an ancestral gene similar to HEF. Segments E1, E\u2032, R, E2, and F2 are present, with 30% sequence identity, in the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) found in coronaviruses4. (Data concerning the antigenicity of HEF and the structural relation between HEF and HE will be published elsewhere.)",

The structures of the complexes of HEF with two receptor analogues5,6, 9-acetamidosialic acid \u03b1-methylglycoside (Fig. 3a) and 9-acetamidosialic acid \u03b1-thiomethylmercuryl glycoside7, show that sialosides bind similarly to HEF and to HA, although they are recognized by different amino-acid side chains (see ref. 8 and references therein). Sialic acid linkage specificity (\u03b1(2,3) vs \u03b1-(2,6)) has been attributed to residues near amino acid 226 in HA8,9,10. The homologous loop (near HEF 270) is truncated in HEF (Fig. 2b), consistent with the lack of linkage specificity of influenza C virus11. The HEF receptor differs from the HA receptor by the addition of an acetyl group at the 9-O position of the glycerol side chain. The acetyl methyl group binds in a nonpolar pocket unique to HEF (Fig. 3a).",

The F3 segments of HA and HEF are very similar in structure (Fig. 2a): each monomer has a central \u03b1-helix along the threefold axis and a smaller N-terminal helix packed antiparallel on the outside and connected by an interhelical loop (Fig. 2a). In HEF2, although the central helices interact closely in the middle like HA, they diverge from the trimer axis at both ends (Fig. 5a). At the top, the interhelical loops interpose between the first five turns of the long helices (residues 80\u201397), where loop residues HEF2 Arg 69 and central helix residues HEF2 Glu 95 form salt bridges and contact an unidentified ion (possibly a sulphate) on the trimer axis. Although HEF2 has a sequence deletion of seven residues in the loop region, this difference would preserve the register of the heptads during the formation of an extended triple-stranded coil in the low-pH conformation, like that in HA12. Unlike HA, however, the top third of the triple-stranded helical bundle must first make interactions on the trimer axis after the removal of the interhelical loop, before the N-terminal coiled-coil extension can form.",

Residues N-terminal to residue 10 fold back out to the surface of the protein, where aspartic acids at positions 5 and 6 of HEF2 can interact with Arg 29 and Lys 30 of HEF2 and Lys 4 of HEF1. Residues 1\u20134 of HEF2 appear to be disordered on the surface of the molecule. In HEF, the residues that are functionally analogous to the fusion peptide of HA, namely the buried residues whose exposure would convert a soluble protein into a lipophilic one, are displaced along the sequence by six residues. HEF may therefore be regarded as having an internal fusion peptide, similar to virus fusion proteins that do not require cleavage activation. The conformation of the N terminus of the HEF2 fusion peptide may indicate that fusion peptides can insert into membranes as loops.",

A precursor to HEF may have evolved by recombination events that resulted in the insertion of R into a surface loop of E, and E into the interhelical loop of the stem domain F (Fig. 2c). In such a scheme, the trimeric F domain (Fig. 5b) may have been an ancestral membrane-fusion protein analogous to the single-function fusion proteins of paramyxoviruses such as Sendai14. Similar modular structures of the envelope glycoproteins of retroviruses are suggested by biochemical data. The first 62 and the last 20 residues of gp120 from HIV-1 can be removed, retaining receptor binding of the fragment15, indicating that those terminal segments might be analogous to F1 and F2, forming with gp41 (F3) the stem of gp160 (15\u201317).",
