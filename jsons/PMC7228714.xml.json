It is clinically oriented, and of great value to the medical workers on the frontline. It revealed that the clinical symptoms of pregnant women were atypical, despite unavailable data about pregnancy outcome in the study. We mainly focused on the pregnancy outcome in patients with COVID-19. It seems that SARS-CoV-2 would be more friendly than its members of the coronavirus family,2 such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which caused severe maternal and neonatal complications.3 Currently, it is too early yet to explicitly determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on pregnant women and their fetuses.4 Here we explored the impact on pregnancy in patients with COVID-19 from multiple medical centers outside Wuhan, China.",

A detailed analysis of clinical features was shown in Table 1\n. Diagnosis criteria and other details were presented in Supplementary material. The age range was 27-33 years. Two (20%) patients had uterine scarring and one patient was twin pregnancy. Five patients (62.5%) developed mild symptoms; three patients (37.5%) showed severe or critical illness requiring ICU admission, one of which undergone ECMO support; four patients (50%) were performed emergency deliveries because of fetal distress or premature rupture of the membrane (PROM). Specially, patient 6 with twin pregnancy had preeclampsia with high blood pressure of 180/100mmHg and later developed into eclampsia; patient 7 presented with mild symptoms at first and her condition deteriorated rapidly within 6 hours after admission, with severe complications including septic shock, septic cardiomyopathy, ARDS, MODS, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Six livebirths and one stillbirth were analyzed. Half of the livebirths were premature and admitted to NICU; one twin died at the 18 days of birth with severe pneumonia, referred to \u201cwhite lung\u201d; another twin showed suspected viral pneumonia on chest CT (Figure 1\n) and survived after treatment. RT-PCR tests of throat swab specimens for all livebirths were negative.",

Firstly, unlike previous reports about the favorable outcomes, SARS-CoV-2 might have similar behavior to SARS and MERS, resulting in severe maternal and neonatal outcomes including preterm delivery, PROM, fetal distress, stillborn or neonatal death, admission to ICU or NICU, undergoing endotracheal intubation, septic shock, eclampsia, and MODS. Secondly, those who are older or those who have medical histories such as hypertension and cardiovascular disease tend to fare worse,5 other than that, immunocompromised status and physiological adaptive changes during pregnancy might contribute to the rapid deterioration into severe or critical illness. Considering the unfavorable outcomes in pregnant patients, any suspected cases during pregnancy should be systematic screening; closely follow-up for mothers and their fetuses after diagnosis should be emphasized. Finally, despite all livebirths were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, the stillbirth and one neonatal death at 18-days of birth indicated the potential risk of intrauterine infection.6 There should be more evidence to deep investigation in the future study.",
