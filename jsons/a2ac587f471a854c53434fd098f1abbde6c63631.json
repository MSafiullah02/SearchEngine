These tragic numbers underscore the need for strict adherence to infection control precautions when caring for patients with Ebola and other diseases that are both highly infectious and potentially fatal. In addition to the use of personal protection equipment (PPE), such measures include source isolation of infected patients. In the process of confining infectious pathogens, however, it is essential that health systems do not overlook the psychological needs of patients nor that of the medical staff who care for them. This chapter is divided into two sections. The first explores the experiences of patients cared for in source isolation, highlighting the possible iatrogenic psychological consequences of treatment on a biocontainment unit. Strategies for mitigating the potentially harmful psychological effects of isolation are reviewed, including considerations for children. The second section considers the experiences of healthcare workers. The discussion outlines the psychological impact of treating infectious diseases, risk factors for emotional distress, and strategies to promote psychological wellbeing and resilience.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 119, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Patients treated in specialized hospital infection control units are subject to the full range of stressors attendant to hospitalization on any medical-surgical floor, such as incomplete understanding of the illness and treatment, anxiety about the outcome, painful conditions or procedures, and being away from home [2] . Beyond these sources of stress, however, patients treated in dedicated isolation rooms face a variety of unique challenges, including confinement in a small space, reduced opportunities for interaction with others, and potential stigmatization. Indeed, while source isolation is an essential strategy for minimizing risk to healthcare workers as well as the broader community, research conducted over the past two decades suggests that infection control precautions involving isolation may have negative psychological consequences for patients. Compared to hospitalized patients who are not isolated, for example, patients treated in isolation for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and Clostridium difficile are at increased risk for symptoms of depression and anxiety [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The data suggest that symptoms are likely to emerge after 2-3 days of isolation and may intensify with increased length of treatment [3, 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Of course, beyond the effects of isolation, patients with life-threatening infectious diseases such as Ebola are at risk for significant emotional distress due to the traumatic nature of the symptoms themselves, the prospect of dying, and having witnessed or cared for others who died from the disease [11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 317, "end": 320, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1096, "end": 1099, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1103, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1107, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1111, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1112, "end": 1115, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1251, "end": 1254, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1257, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1261, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1265, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1266, "end": 1269, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1273, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1278, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1587, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Psychological Consequences"}, {"text": "The literature on the psychological effects of isolation includes numerous qualitative-phenomenological studies, typically using semi-structured interviews to elicit patients' perceptions and recommendations.

In addition, curtailment in meaningful activities, including opportunities for socialization with friends, family, and other patients, may play a role in the harmful psychological consequences of isolation [13, [16] [17] [18] 22] . More generally, diminished sensory stimuli, including a limited view of the rest of the hospital unit [29, 30] and reduced visual contact with others [13] , might also contribute to the adverse effects of treatment in an isolation room. Furthermore, when infection control precautions include masks, even face-to-face interactions with staff provide less sensory input [17] . Indeed, Ebola patients at both Nebraska Medicine and Emory University described frustration with the lack of full face-to-face visual contact as well as minimal tactile connection with others. Patients in source isolation for infections have also reported that isolation hampered their recovery and physical rehabilitation [17, 21, 29] .
