Obviously, the integral is finite. We now start to deform the contour in the region of analyticity of the function F (s). Such deformations do not change the (finite) value of the integral. Finally, we end up with the contour \u0393 3 which embraces the cut from s = 4m 2 to s = \u221e, and the large circle. With the appropriate number of subtractions, the large-circle integral vanishes, and we end up with the contour integral which embraces the cut. This integral needs some care. It may be split into two parts: (I) the integral over a small circle of radius \u01eb around the threshold s = 4m 2 , and (II) the integral over the \"cut\" starting from s = 4m 2 + \u01eb to \u221e along the real s-axis. The sum of these two integrals is finite due to the general property of the analytic functions mentioned above. If the behavior of the function F (s) near the threshold is such that the integral of Im F (s) over the cut is finite, then the small-circle integral vanished as \u01eb \u2192 0. However, the situation changes for the case when Im F (s) has a non-integrable singularity at the threshold: then, the small-circle integral (I) also diverges for \u01eb \u2192 0, making the sum of (I) and (II) finite for \u01eb \u2192 0.

In other words, to obtain F (z) one needs to subtract from F 3 (z, \u01eb) all singular terms in \u01eb and then send \u01eb \u2192 0. To prove this statement we just show that F (z) obtained in this way satisfies Eq. (2.10). We turn to Eq. (2.9) and omit the first term in its r.h.s., which is singular in \u01eb. Then we check which of the remaining structures may give a non-vanishing contribution when integrated over the small circle. The second term in the r.h.s. of Eq.

In this way one consistently handles the singularities which emerge in the dispersion integrals at any order of the perturbative expansion.

(2.12) It is straightforward to check that on the upper boundary of the cut along the real axis from z = 1 to +\u221e [to get there one needs to set z \u2192 z + i0 for z > 1], the imaginary part of F (z) is indeed equal to (1 \u2212 1/z) \u22123/2 . For higher-order contributions, the small-circle integrals produce singular terms containing a series of inverse powers of \u221a \u01eb related to poles of the increasing order at the threshold z = 1. For instance, in the case of the spectral density \u03c1 6 (s) \u221d 1/v 5 the dispersion integral over the cut yieldswhere the term with the curly brackets is finite at the threhsold z = 1. The small-circle integral of the singular at the threshold \u01eb-independent part of F 5 (z, \u01eb) (i.e., the last term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (2.13)) giveswhere we made use of the integral 2\u03c0 0 d\u03c6 e \u2212i3\u03c6/2 = \u22124i/3.We emphasize that due to the Cauchi theorem it is not necessary to analyse the small-circle integrals explicitly: it is sufficient to calculate the singular in \u01eb terms in the dispersion integral in Eq. (2.5). The small-circle contributions are equal to these singular terms taken with the opposite sign.",

For instance, for Coulomb exchanges, the exact analytic result for the full spectral density is known, Eq. (2.1): \u03c1(z) is finite at the threshold. To understand what happens with the corresponding small-circle contribution, we get back to the Cauchi theorem:Since the spectral density \u03c1(z) takes a finite value at the threshold, the dispersion integral is finite in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 for all z = 1, and the solution of Eq. (3.1) yields the function F (z) which has a logarithmic singularity at z = 1; F (z) has no stronger singularities at the threshold z = 1 and, consequently, the small-circle integral in Eq. (3.1) vanishes in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0. So, we see that, although the small-circle contribution emerging at each order of the perturbative expansion diverges in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0, their sum vanishes in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 in the case of the full spectral density finite at the threshold.",
