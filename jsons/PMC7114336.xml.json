            "text": "When, half a century ago, virologists discovered interferon as an endogenous antiviral substance, it soon became evident that the biological role of interferon was not confined to defence against virus infection. For one thing, infection with microbes other than viruses appeared to induce interferon production, and interferon proved to be able to protect experimental animals against infection by non-viral agents. Moreover, in vitro studies documented a variety of biological activities of interferon, including ability to inhibit division of certain tumour cell lines, to activate cytolytic potential of NK cells or T lymphocytes and to enhance MHC molecule expression. Together these properties made interferon become recognized as a key component of innate immunity.",

            "text": "Activation of innate immunity manifests itself in many ways, a prominent one being inflammation. Acute inflammation is defined as a combination of: (i) vascular changes, mainly vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, changes in endothelial adherence properties and sometimes intravascular blood clotting followed by disruption of blood vessels and bleeding; (ii) transudation of fluid causing oedematous swelling; (iii) exudation and active diapedesis of leukocytes from the vessels causing cellular infiltration and induration of the inflamed tissue. In chronic inflammation, characteristic for persistent low-grade exposure to inflammatory agents, intermittent vascular changes and oedema are usually less pronounced, but cellular infiltrates may develop into extensive granulomas and initiate fibrous scar tissue which cause destruction and deformation of organs such as bone, cartilage, kidney, lung, etc. Localized or organ-specific inflammation is mostly accompanied by metabolic and haematopoietic changes resulting in altered levels of circulating leukocytes, hypertrophy and changes in architecture of lymphoid organs and altered levels of certain proteins (acute-phase reactants) in plasma.",

Instead, the early focus for exploration of non-antiviral effects was on anti-tumour cell effects and on regulation of B and T cell immunity, activities that were perceived as offering perspective for overall boosting of immune defence against cancer. At the time, inflammation researchers were addressing granulocyte rather than lymphocyte biology and, as a community, they had little interaction with interferon workers. With the discovery and/or characterization of many other cytokines (IL-1, TNF, IL-6) and chemokines, non-antiviral actions of interferons gradually came to be seen as a sector of the cytokine network that controls responses of innate as well as acquired immunity.",

Fever reactions and skin inflammation (De Somer et al., 1977) elicited by the interferon injections in the patients made us become interested in the role of interferon in inflammation, a line of investigation that would lead us to the isolation and characterization of novel inflammatory mediators that are co-induced with interferon or that interact with interferons. Just to name a few: the IFN-\u03b2-inducing cytokine interleukin-1 (Van Damme et al., 1985), the IFN-\u03b2 companion cytokine and strong pyrogen IL-6 (Van Damme et al., 1987), the chemokines granulocyte-chemotactic protein-1 (GCP-1), now IL-8 (Van Damme et al., 1989), GCP-2 (Proost et al., 1993) and the monocyte-chemotactic proteins MCP-2 and -3 (Van Damme et al., 1992). Our laboratory's involvement with inflammation was completed by investigation of the matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and their interaction with cytokines and chemokines (Opdenakker et al., 2003).",

Their observations indicated that interferon (semi-purified mouse IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 105\n units i.v. 1 h before carrageenin challenge) exerted a significant but modest anti-inflammatory effect (24% reduction in footpad swelling).

Both these viruses are potent inducers of systemic IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 in mice. That interferon was instrumental in bringing about suppression was evident from the demonstration that it could partially be undone by prior administration of neutralizing antibodies directed against mouse IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. The inflammatory response could also be inhibited by giving the mice a series of intraperitoneal injections of interferon starting shortly before LPS challenge (Heremans et al., 1987b). The degree of inhibition was dose-dependent requiring at least 20.000\u201330.000 units/mouse given daily on days 0\u20133 relative to LPS injection. Inhibition was observed not only with natural IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 or recombinant IFN-\u03b11, but remarkably also with recombinant IFN-\u03b3.",

ICAM-1 was overexpressed in the IL-8-injected brain region, but this upregulation was not reduced in IFN-treated animals, leading the authors to dismiss effects on ICAM-1 expression as the explanation for the protective action of IFN-\u03b2. The other possible mechanism considered by these workers was inhibition of MMP-9 (gelatinase B) production or release. Zymography showed the presence of MMP-9 in the injected brain region. Significantly, depleting the animals in neutrophils before IL-8 injection as well as treatment with IFN-\u03b2 prevented both disruption of the BBB and appearance of MMP-9. The model proposed is that neutrophils need autocrine MMP-9 in order to be able to disrupt and transgress the BBB. Local injection of IL-8 is considered to be a stimulant and IFN-\u03b2 an inhibitor of MMP-9 secretion by neutrophils.",

While some workers could confirm these observations (Hirsch et al., 1974), others working with smaller doses of interferon found the opposite effect (Skurkovich et al., 1973). As discussed by De Maeyer and De Maeyer-Guignard (1982), low levels of systemic interferon might enhance, while high levels might inhibit graft rejection.",

Currently the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin is the recommended treatment for persistent HCV infection accompanied by liver inflammation and incipient fibrosis. Sustained viral responses can be achieved in 40 to 80% of cases (for review, see Ward and Kugelmas, 2005). Pegylated IFN-\u03b1 is also the treatment of choice, reportedly superior to lamivudine, for chronic HBV infection (Lau et al., 2005). Viral responses are accompanied by variable degrees of improvement in liver function and reduction in inflammatory changes in the liver. In the case of HCV-associated chronic liver disease, evidence is accumulating that application of interferon-based treatment schedules also result in a delay in the development of HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (Camma et al., 2001, Azzaroli et al., 2004, Soga et al., 2005, Omata et al., 2005).",

However, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities of interferon might also contribute, respectively, by providing direct tissue protection and/or more adequate viral antigen-specific immune responses. Carotenuto et al. (2005) hypothesized that interferon boosts the antiviral response by modifying the function of intrahepatic antigen-presenting cells. In order to separate this effect from the consequences of direct antiviral effects, they examined changes in intrahepatic APC and T cells during interferon treatment in patients whose viral load had already been reduced by treatment with lamivudine. During therapy, expression of CD14 on Kupffer cells in liver biopsies increased and, simultaneously, serum levels of soluble CD14 also increased. These effects were considered as an indication that IFN-\u03b1 promotes differentiation of myeloid dendritic cells, an effect also reported to occur in in vitro systems. At the same time T cell infiltration in the portal spaces was reduced, mainly due to a drastic decrease in the number of CD8+ T cells. The authors noted that T cell infiltration in the liver generally concerns non-antigen-specific bystander cells and depends on the presence of increased levels of matrix metalloproteases. Hence, they speculated that the depletion of CD8+ T cells during IFN-\u03b1 therapy is an effect independent from that on hepatic APC and may be due to a reduction in the release of matrix-degrading metalloproteases. Other studies, however, indicate that increased intrahepatic CD8+ lymphocyte counts are important for the viral response to IFN-\u03b1 (Tang et al., 2005).",

Concomitantly with increased sVCAM-1 levels, expression of the VCAM-1 counter-receptor VLA-4 on lymphocytes decreased (Calabresi et al., 1997a); in vitro treatment of lymphocytes with IFN-\u03b2 did not reproduce this effect, though treatment with VCAM-1 did reduce VLA-4 expression. The authors proposed that, following IFN-\u03b2 treatment in patients, the increase in soluble VCAM-1 causes downregulation of VLA-4, the net effect being inhibition of adhesive interactions between lymphocytes and brain endothelial cells. These in vivo studies demonstrate that the in vitro actions of IFN-\u03b2 on the biology of VCAM-1 do take place in vivo.

Also, serum levels of the enzyme are increased (Waubant et al., 1999, Liuzzi et al., 2002, Dubois et al., 2003). In several independent studies treatment with IFN-\u03b2 was associated with a decrease in serum MMP-9 and/or an increase in the level of TIMP-1 (Trojano et al., 1999, Waubant et al., 2001, Giannelli et al., 2002, Waubant et al., 2003, Yushchenko et al., 2003, Karabudak et al., 2004, Avolio et al., 2005).

Dendritic cells generated in vitro from peripheral blood monocytes in the presence of Type I interferons have properties different from those of dendritic cells generated by the classical combination of GM-CSF plus IL-4 (Santini et al., 2000). In the presence of IFN-\u03b2, maturation of dendritic cells progresses more rapidly. The resulting cells are generally more potent in exerting antigen-presenting activity, e.g. when used in mixed leukocyte reactions or as APC primed with specific antigens. Their cytokine secretion profile is also distinct in that IL-12 production may be low, while IL-15 (Santini et al., 2000) and IL-6 (Detournay et al., 2005) production levels are high. IL-6 was shown to be instrumental in enhancing MLR by acting antagonistically on CD4+CD25+ suppressor cells (Detournay et al., 2005). Murine dendritic cells derived in vitro from bone marrow cells, or isolated from the spleen express Type I interferons, suggesting that an autocrine positive feed-back loop is operational during dendritic cell maturation (Montoya et al., 2002).",

Though Type I interferon was first believed to possess similar potentiating effect on TNF-\u03b1 production (Wallach, 1986), a later study (Abu-khabar et al., 1992) demonstrated that IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 rather inhibit TNF-\u03b1 production by mitogen-activated human PBMC. A similar inhibitory effect was seen with LPS as inducer of IL-1 and IL-1 receptor antagonist in whole human blood in vitro (Huang et al., 1995). Also in a study on the effects of IFN-\u03b2 in collagen-induced arthritis in mice, IFN-\u03b2 was found to reduce the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 produced in vitro by lipopolysaccharide/IFN-\u03b3-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (Triantaphyllopoulos et al., 1999).",

This suppression concerns erythropoiesis as well as leukopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. Acute inflammation is mostly associated with a myelopoietic burst responsible for increased blood leukocyte counts and contributing to infiltration of local inflammatory sites with leukocytes. By its myelosuppressive effect, any interferon produced during inflammatory reactions, might therefore mitigate both this systemic response as well as leukocyte infiltration at local inflammatory sites. As to Type I interferon, no information supporting this proposal seems to be available. However, in the case of IFN-\u03b3, studies in mice have shown that endogenous IFN-\u03b3 is a powerful downregulator of myelopoiesis elicited by inflammatory stimuli, such that ablation of IFN-\u03b3 by administration of neutralizing antibody or by gene knock-out results in more severe inflammatory reactions (Matthys et al., 2000).",

Many of the observations supporting this conclusion were done in the context of the need to provide an explanation for the now generally recognized beneficial effect of IFN-\u03b2 therapy in RRMS. However, in a few in vivo animal models for inflammatory reactions or diseases with a strong inflammatory component, Type I interferon was confirmed to provide at least partial protection. Finally, evidence is available to suggest that, also in chronic viral hepatitis, part of the beneficial effect of Type I interferon therapy may well be accounted for by an anti-inflammatory effect.",

It serves the purpose of immediate early defence against local insults, typical for innate immunity, but it is also essential for adequate development of later adaptive immunity. For instance, whether any adaptive response assumes a Th1 or Th2 character depends largely on the assortment of leukocytes and their cytokines and chemokines participating in the preceding acute inflammation. Given the observation that IFN-\u03b2 has the potential to regulate recruitment as well as secretory activity of leukocytes during inflammation, it follows that IFN-\u03b2 may also participate in the regulation of adaptive immune responses. This may be part of the explanation for observations in mice or rats that treatment with IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 can modify the course of experimental diseases with complex pathogenesis such as EAE, CIA, or skin graft acceptance.",

Interferon's natural task during acute virus infection may therefore consist not only in inhibiting virus replication but also in mitigating inflammation. If this would indeed be the case, one would be allowed to think (perhaps a bit wishfully) that interferon is a suitable anti-inflammatory agent to be used in severe acute virus infections, superior to steroids or NSAIDs. Clinical tests done in the 1980s have shown that Type I interferons were of very little value in \u2018common\u2019 acute virus infections. However, severe acute infections caused by \u2018unusual\u2019 viruses such as the SARS coronavirus, seem to owe their life-threatening severity to excessive inflammatory reactions, as has been documented by massive production of certain cytokines (Huang et al., 2005) and chemokines (Law et al., 2005). Remarkably, this so-called cytokine storm appeared to be accompanied with only low-level production of IFN-\u03b2. Interferon therapy, thanks to a combined direct antiviral and a \u2018natural\u2019 anti-inflammatory potential, might represent a prototype approach for management of such infections.",

Moreover, as underlying mechanisms will be further elucidated, investigators may more easily find agents that have anti-inflammatory actions similar to those of interferon, and that may replace Type I interferons in the treatment for MS or other chronic inflammatory illnesses. Clearly, there is a need for further and more thorough investigation. Further in-depth characterization of cellular effects, such as those reviewed here, will be extremely important to make this possible.
