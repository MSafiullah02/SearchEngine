Patients with any of the following criteria were excluded: recent hospitalization (<28 days for immunocompetent patients and <90 days for immunosuppressed patients), nursing home resident not functionally independent [ 20 ], tracheostomy, gastrostomy, cystic fibrosis, cancer with neutropenia, solid organ or hematopoietic stem-cell transplant within the previous 90 days, active graft-vs-host disease, bronchiolitis obliterans, or human immunodeficiency virus infection with a CD4 cell count <200 mm 3 . The study population for the current analysis included adults in the EPIC study cohort who underwent at least 1 diagnostic test for both bacteria and viruses, which are outlined below. ",

MRSA CAP was uncommon among patients not admitted to an ICU, with a prevalence of 2 (0.1%) MRSA cases out of 1777 patients in this study, providing support for the current IDSA/ATS CAP guidelines [ 17 ] that do not recommend routine anti-MRSA antibiotics for patients admitted to a general medical floor. The prevalence of MRSA CAP among patients admitted to an ICU was 2.7%, and their clinical outcomes were particularly severe. Therefore, empirical anti-MRSA therapy for critically ill CAP patients appears to be an important consideration until results of diagnostic testing are available, especially since failure of initial empirical antibiotics to cover for the infecting pathogen appears to be associated with increased mortality in sepsis [ 40 ].

Our results complement and expand on those published by Moran et al [ 7 ] in several important respects; namely, we studied a larger population 4\u20136 years later in 2 cities not evaluated in the prior study, enrolled a population-based cohort year-round for 2.5 consecutive years, and performed systematic influenza testing to understand the frequency of S. aureus and influenza coinfections. Similar to our results, Moran et al [ 7 ] also found that patients with MRSA CAP had high pneumonia severity scores at presentation, but that epidemiologic and clinical features were not particularly helpful for identifying MRSA cases for the purposes of guiding empirical antibiotic selection. Interestingly, in-patient mortality for MRSA CAP in our study (13.3%) and that of Moran et al [ 7 ] (14%) was similar and substantially lower than in older MRSA CAP case series [ 2 , 3 , 43 , 44 ].

Patients with strong risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens, including recent hospitalization, tracheostomy, gastrostomy, and nursing home residents unable to perform activities of daily living, were excluded from this study [ 18 , 36\u201338 ]. However, some patients with traditional HCAP criteria outlined by the IDSA/ATS pneumonia guidelines [ 45 ] were eligible for inclusion, including functionally independent nursing home residents and patients with chronic hemodialysis use. These patients were included to allow for more comprehensive evaluation of characteristics associated with S. aureus CAP. Hemodialysis use was significantly associated with S. aureus infection, supporting the recommendation to consider empiric anti-MRSA antibiotics in hemodialysis patients who are hospitalized for pneumonia [ 45 ]. Importantly, when analyses were repeated after patients with these traditional HCAP risk factors (hemodialysis use and nursing home residency) were excluded, the prevalence of MRSA was very low (0.6%) and the use of anti-MRSA antibiotics remained high (28.0%).

First, 68% of patients identified as eligible were enrolled; among these, 91% of patients met the final radiographic criteria and also had appropriate testing for both bacteria and viruses and thus were included in this analysis. Nonenrollment was largely due to patients or surrogates declining participation in the study; nonenrolled patients were older, more likely to require invasive mechanical ventilation, and more likely to die in the hospital [ 17 ]. Whether patients with S. aureus CAP were differentially enrolled in the study is unknown. Second, detection of S. aureus was based on cultures of blood and respiratory secretions, which may have missed the presence of S. aureus at the site of disease pathology in the lung. Results from invasive sampling, such as BAL and pleural fluid, were only included when these specimens were obtained for routine clinical care. This may have contributed to more S. aureus detection in patients with ICU admission and higher severity scores. Third, S. aureus can colonize the respiratory tract without causing illness. We attempted to minimize misclassification of colonizing S. aureus as S. aureus CAP by only including sputum and endotracheal samples that met high-quality criteria and BAL cultures with moderate or heavy growth [ 9 ]. Fourth, the number of S. aureus cases was small, limiting the precision of statistical comparisons and precluding more robust multivariable analyses. Fifth, we evaluated for concurrent influenza and S. aureus infections but could not assess for influenza infection as a precipitating event before S. aureus CAP because we did not obtain samples prior to hospital presentation. Sixth, our study population may not be fully representative of other geographic regions or time periods. ",
