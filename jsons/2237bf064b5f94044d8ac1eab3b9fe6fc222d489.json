            "text": "The triggers as well as etiologies for AE-IPF are not known. The 2007 criteria proposed by Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Network (IPFnet) defined acute exacerbation of IPF as acute clinical worsening (<30 days) in a patient with known or newly diagnosed IPF with acceleration of dyspnea and/or hypoxemia and new radiologic changes, typically ground glass opacities, on a background of fibrotic disease (example Fig. 30 .1) [1, 2] . The revised criteria in 2016 did not set a definite 30-day duration of onset of symptoms but defined AE-IPF as an \"acute, clinically significant respiratory deterioration characterized by evidence of new widespread alveolar abnormality typically less than one month's duration\" [3] . Common mimics like fluid overload due to heart failure and infections should be excluded although this is not straightforward in some patients. The underlying pathologic insult is classically described as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) [4] , the histologic finding of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has been superimposed on usual interstitial pneumonia. However, biopsy of the lung to prove DAD is rarely ever pursued due to the morbidity and mortality of the procedure. Common concomitant symptoms mimic a viral lower respiratory tract infection with fever, malaise, flu like symptoms and cough; though these symptoms are not needed to make the diagnosis [1] [2] [3] . Ideally, infection is excluded by BAL as in the case presentation; however given the worsening hypoxemia in addition to typical poor baseline pulmonary health, a BAL may precipitate a life-threatening impairment in gas exchange. If a BAL cannot be completed, treatment for typical bacterial organisms or hospital acquired organisms are employed presumptively, as applicable. If structural lung disease exists (as most patients usually have traction bronchiectasis) it may be worthwhile to treat Pseudomonas on an empiric basis, though evidentiary support for this is lacking.",

Others have argued, and shown, that even short-term survival allows a window for pulmonary transplantation [10] .

However diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is usually the realm of the pulmonologist. Ensuring that the patient has an accurate diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is critical to determining prognosis for the underlying condition. Fibrotic lung disease associated with collagen-vascular disease, such as polymyositis, has also been associated with acute exacerbations, and may have a better prognosis [15] . Many pulmonologists who are less familiar with interstitial lung diseases often incorrectly attribute all types of lung fibrosis to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [16] . Given the disparate outcomes, accurate discrimination of IPF from other fibrotic lung diseases is critical. Clues on CT scan suggesting the diagnosis of IPF are basal, subpleural predominance of interlobular septal thickening with honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis (see Fig. 30 .1) [13] . In the absence of AE-IPF, evidence of extensive ground glass infiltrates and nodules on CT imaging typically argues against IPF [13] . Clinical findings should include a conspicuous absence of inhalational exposures and rheumatologic conditions. \"Velcro\" rales are typically present on physical exam.

Early studies suggested use of pirfenidone lowered the rate of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [5] , though this was not seen on subsequent studies [43] . In a combined analysis, nintedanib significantly reduced the time to adjudicated AE-IPF, but not investigator reported AE-IPF [7] .
