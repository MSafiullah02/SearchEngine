Patients examined prior to 2007 were enrolled in the study retrospectively by hospital record review and were followed prospectively after hospital admission. The diagnosis of ARDS was made according to international standards [21], which involve acute onset; PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F ratio) <200, independent of controlled mechanical ventilation; and bilateral infiltration observed on chest radiography without left heart failure or with pulmonary artery wedge pressure <18 mmHg. We enrolled patients with severe ARDS whose P/F ratios were <100 during their clinical courses. H5N1 infection was confirmed with throat and/or nasal swabs tested by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction at the hospital laboratory or at the National Institute of Hygiene Epidemiology (Hanoi). The study was reviewed by the ethical committee of the International Medical Center Japan in 2007, and the design was approved on 28 September 2007",

These clinical features of ARDS in the H5N1-negative group made us wonder why ARDS in the H5N1-positive group was not more severe than that in the H5N1-negative group on hospital admission. The survival probability and days until final outcome (\u00b1 standard deviation) among H5N1-positive (n=12) and H5N1-negative (n=25) patients were 17% and 52% and 12.3\u00b15.7 days (median, 11 days) and 21.5\u00b113.8 days (median, 22 days), respectively, demonstrating that the survival probability in the H5N1-positive group was significantly lower than that in the H5N1-negative group (P=.022, by log-rank test; P=.038, by Tarone-Ware test) (figure 1).

Our study confirmed that survival of patients with ARDS aged <16 years is drastically improved by medical care, but that these patients die of respiratory failure and multiple organ failure [14]. On the other hand, most patients in the H5N1-positive group still showed rapid progress and deterioration of ARDS and died of respiratory failure, even with proper medical care followed by pathological investigation. Although aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were higher in the H5N1-positive but not the H5N1-negative group, the elevation of serum aminotransferase levels is a relatively common feature in H5N1 patients [6, 9, 25]. A review of 2 groups of patients in large case studies has shown that elevated aminotransferase levels are not thought to be specific in H5N1 patients [26, 27]. These observations strongly suggest that H5N1-infected patients die because of rapidly progressive respiratory failure before revealing typical multiple organ failure status accompanied by failure of multiple organs such as liver, heart, and kidney",

P/F ratios were <100 in both H5N1-positive and -negative patients, which means that the oxygenation capacity in both groups was severely damaged. Surprisingly, PaCO2 levels revealed that ventilation capacity was normal in H5N1-positive patients but was severely damaged in H5N1-negative patients with ARDS; that is, H5N1-negative patients experienced more severe respiratory failure than did H5N1-positive patients on hospital admission. The log-rank test and the more severely conditioned Tarone-Ware test also showed a significant difference in survival probability between the H5N1-positive and H5N1-negative groups. H5N1-positive patients started with normal ventilation capacity on hospital admission, then rapidly proceeded to severe respiratory failure and death. Patients in the H5N1-positive group demonstrated a shorter duration until final outcome than patients in the H5N1-negative group; therefore, we designated these as fulminant ARDS patients. The initial check of blood gas levels may be an early diagnostic indicator of H5N1 infection. There may also be some mechanisms that influence cell activity during H5N1 infection and accelerate alveolar damage, resulting in death [28, 29]. Pathology and immunomodulator activity in H5N1 infection have been discussed elsewhere [30], but precise mechanisms have not been clarified yet [31]",
