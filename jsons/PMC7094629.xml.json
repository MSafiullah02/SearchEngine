It is ubiquitously distributed in soil, fossils (particularly in crude oil), water, air and living organisms. In sea water vanadium exists mainly in the form of H2VO4\n\u2212 and is the 2nd most abundant transition element, being about two orders of magnitude more abundant than iron [6]. The usual V concentrations in drinking water are in the 10 nM range, but groundwater from volcanic areas may contain much higher amounts, up to ca. 2.5 \u03bcM [6], and contamination is frequently observed in rivers, lakes and seas ([11] and references therein).",

The phosphatases that hydrolyze phosphoproteins are classified in two groups: with affinity for serine\u2013threonine phosphate proteins (PS/TPases) and those with affinity to tyrosine-phosphate proteins (PTPases). All of them catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphate esters. The PS/TPases are metalloenzymes that produce the direct attack of a water molecule to the P atom of the substrate. On the contrary, the PTPases are not metalloenzymes and their active site has a cysteine residue and in their catalytic mechanism a fosfocysteine is formed as an intermediate. Moreover, these enzymes are structural and mechanistically different from the acid and alkaline phosphatases as well as those that hydrolize phosphate-esters of small molecules such as glucose-6-phosphate [34]. Vanadium compounds can oxidize this cysteine residue by the formation of free radicals regulating in that way many biological events [35], [36], [37].",

Structurally, vanadate is similar to phosphate but it is important to emphasize that vanadate shows a greater flexibility in its coordination geometry. Both anions participate in similar reactions. The generation of a stable transition state between the vanadate and the enzyme has been considered the reason for its inhibitory effect to the enzyme activity. Studies by X-ray diffraction demonstrated that vanadate binds in the active site of the enzyme with trigonal bipyramid geometry. Assays with vanadium compounds of different coordination geometry suggested that the complexes with five coordination were more potent inhibitors than those with coordination numbers six or seven [39]. Nevertheless, there are other factors that can affect the enzymatic activity [39], [40].",

Vanadium can stimulate the enzyme activity through the formation of complexes with ligands that resemble the structure of physiological substrates. For instance, the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is activated by vanadate. Another mechanism to regulate enzymatic activity is related to the enzymes activated or inhibited through the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. Vanadate also forms esters with Tyr residues mimicking their phosphorylation process with a great impact in several biological events. The activation by vanadate of some cytosolic kinases and the insulin receptor (IR) has impact on the balance between phosphorylation\u2013dephosphorylation processes. In vitro experiments with cells in culture show that VCs may cause or enhance insulin mimetic actions such as stimulation of protein phosphorylation in Tyr residues increasing the level of phosphoinositides, stimulate cell proliferation in different cell lines, promote the uptake of small molecules and ions, etc. On the contrary, vanadium compounds also can exhibit antitumor effects as well as toxic and transforming actions in different cell lines. Moreover, it is worthy to know that globally the underlying mechanisms of action of vanadium compounds are still poorly understood [14], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46].",

It has been previously reported that VO(acac)2, VO(maltolato)2 and NaVO3, attenuated basal lipolysis in 3T3L1 adipocytes assessed by glycerol release as a marker of lipolysis [47]. Though both Akt and ERK pathways are activated by the VCs, but only Akt activation by these three vanadium compounds plays a role in their antilipolytic effect. On the other hand, VO(acac)2 can block cell cycle progression at the G1/S phase via a highly activated ERK signal pathway in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The results indicated that similar activated pathways may lead to differential biological consequences for cancer cells and adipocytes, indicating that VCs may be used in the prevention and treatment of both diabetes and cancer. The action of insulin depends on its binding to the hormone receptor and its activation. Then the transduction of the signal involves a series of protein kinases such as MAPK and S6 kinases, as well as lipid kinases such as PI3-K. The insulin mimetic effects of vanadium may be caused by the stimulation of the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor but in different manner than the hormone [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53]. These effects depend on the tissue and the animal species. For instance, in rat lung cells and rabbit and mouse diaphragm cells vanadium did not cause autophosphorylation of insulin receptor [54], [55]. On the other hand, the inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity of insulin receptor by vanadate did not suppress the effects of vanadate on glucose metabolism, suggesting a post-receptor action [52]. VCs that show insulin-like effects, stimulate kinases of the signal transduction pathways used by insulin beyond IR and IRS-1such as MAPKs and PI3K.",

In both spontaneously and chemically induced diabetic animals, vanadium alleviate not only the primary symptoms of diabetes, high blood glucose and triglyceride and cholesterol levels (although tissue vanadium levels normally do not correlate with the glucose-lowering effect), but also prevents or reverses several of the secondary complications: sorbitol accumulation [80], [81], cataract development [82], [83], impaired thyroid hormone [84], [85], alterations in kidney morphology [86], [87] and adrenal hypertrophy [87]. In partially pancreatectomized rats [88] vanadium administration reversed insulin resistance by restoration of muscle glycogen synthesis; in STZ-diabetic rats it stimulated basal hexose uptake in muscle and liver [89] and even in non-diabetic rat muscle vanadium therapy increased sensitivity to insulin stimulation of glycolysis and glycogen synthesis [90], impaired antioxidant status and excessive food and fluid intake [91], [92].",

Probably a relevant aspect deserving care is that neither curcumin nor VO(cur)2 were effective in reducing plasma glucose levels in STZ-diabetic rats. In contrast, there are reports on the capacity of curcumin to facilitate lowering of plasma glucose or to decrease insulin resistance. The difference might be that these experiments by Thompson et al.

The group of Sakurai prepared several VCs and evaluated their biological functions in vitro and in vivo\n[17], [107], demonstrating that whether administration was by acute oral gavage or by acute i.p. injection, VO(alx)2 could be one of the most promising complexes for the treatment of diabetes [108]. The pharmacological functions of VO(alx)2 include hypoglycemic effects and the improvement of hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension [108], [109]. VO(alx)2 significantly induced V uptake in the insulin-responsive tissues such as the adipose, liver and muscle tissues [110]. VO(alx)2 also affects the tyrosine phosphorylation of IR\u03b2 and IRS, leading to the activation of PI3K\u2013Akt signaling and the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Moreover, it was also demonstrated that VO(alx)2 regulates the DNA binding activity of the FoxO1 transcription factor, which in turn controls the expression of gluconeogenesis genes in response to Akt activation [111]. Overall, VO(alx)2 improves diabetes, obesity and hypertension by enhancing insulin sensitivity and leptin resistance in obesity-linked type 2 diabetic KKAy mice and was proposed as a promising VC to treat both type 1 and obesity-linked type 2 diabetes [109].",

Vanadium contents in blood are thus reduced to about 30% within the first 24 h [5], [134].

In cells, usual physiological vanadate concentrations are also too low to allow for the formation of oligovanadates. Locally, however, concentration enhancement or template-directed nucleation [144] may take place, and the oligovanadate(s) then formed can interact with proteins and DNA. Cellular targets and processes probably affected by decavadates are: (1) membrane depolarization, (2) pumps, channels, receptors in cellular membrane and in endoplasmic reticulum membrane, (3) contractile system, (4) cytoskeleton structure and function, (5) mitochondria bioenergetics, (6) ROSs species changes and antioxidants responses, and (7) probably also nucleous [112].",

Regarding the cellular uptake of vanadium, present in a prospective drug of composition V\nIV\nOL\nn, several scenarios can apply for the up-take process:-The complex is stable enough to remain intact, and sufficiently lipophilic to slowly cross the cellular membrane via diffusion. Pyridinone complexes such as 4 in Fig. 2 enter erythrocytes by diffusion [150].-The ligands are detached, oxidation occurs, thus forming H2VO4\n\u2212, and vanadium may enter the cells as monovanadate via anion channels.-The ligand system is maintained, or is replaced in part or completely by transferrin to form VIVO(L)(hTF) (see right side of Fig. 5) and (VIVO)2hTF [7], [155], [156]. Namely (VIVO)2hTF is probably recognized by the cellular hTF receptors and internalized via endocytosis [149]; there is no information available regarding VIVO(L)(hTF), but in this case probably hTF does not form the \u2018closed conformation\u2019 required for adequate binding to the cell receptors.-Either VIVO2+, or vanadates, or VIVO(L)n species, bind holo-hTF, at available donor atoms of the protein; these species are probably recognized by the cellular hTF receptors and internalized via endocytosis [143], [157].-VIII species may form, e.g. (VIII)2hTF and or (VIII)(FeIII)hTF, which forms the \u2018closed conformation\u2019 and probably is recognized by the cellular hTF receptors and also internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis [143].-The complex is stable enough to remain intact and contains one or more functions in the outer coordination sphere that are recognized by cell receptors; receptor-mediated uptake is then again a potential transport route.-Albumin receptors on the cell (e.g. adipocites) surface would also be likely vehicles if a VC binds to HSA [158].\n",

In rats treated with VOSO4 vanadium was found in kidney > liver > bone > pancreas [161], [162], [163], while in rats treated with VCs such as VO(5-ipa)2 (Fig. 6\n) it was detected in bone > kidney > spleen > liver > pancreas [164].

VCs with electron-withdrawing and donating groups remained significantly at higher levels and longer, due to their slower clearance rates from blood, suggesting that the high exposure and longer residence of the VC is associated with a higher normoglycemic effect in diabetic animals.

Either by endocytosis, by diffusion, or by the anion channels (vanadate), vanadium may be uptaken by cells and then be again subjected to speciation and redox leveling. Its availability for subsequent therapeutic or toxicity effects will depend on several factors, namely the amount uptaken, the type of tissue and if the carrier ligand is still present or not, allowing leveling of effects and/or targeting to the sites of therapeutic action.

The IR is a tetrameric trans-membrane protein, being tyrosine kinases, with two \u03b1 subunits exposed to the outside and the two \u03b2 subunits (IR\u03b2) exposed to the cytosol. When insulin docks to the \u03b1 subunits, the tyrosine residues of the intracellular \u03b2 subunit IR\u03b2 become phosphorylated, this corresponding to the activation of IR\u03b2. The cytosolic insulin-signaling cascade is initiated in this way, and involves several post-receptor events, ending up with the activation of the glucose transporter (GLUT4). Thus, the phosphorilation of IR\u03b2 triggers the phosphorylation of IR substrates, IRS, intracellular proteins containing tyrosine residues. The activation of the IRS in turn initiates a signaling cascade, in the course of which kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) are activated [3], [183].

In this way and through the activation of the PI3K pathway, the phosphorylation of PKB is mediated as well as its downstream targets which regulate glucose transport, glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenesis. The group of Crans [205] also suggested that activation of IR signaling by both insulin and BMOV administration involves increased association of IR with specialized nanoscale membrane micro-domains.

Another advantage of Metvan is that it is highly effective against ovarian cancer and testicular cancer cell lines resistant to cisplatin. Its action is probably associated with the generation of ROS and depletion of glutathione together with a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. The metastatic properties of some tumor cells such as human malignant glioblastoma and breast cancer were also highly inhibited or impaired by Metvan.

Besides, the complexes were deleterious on the viability of an in vivo model of zebrafish eggs. A good correlation between the in vitro and in vivo experiments was supported by the IC50 values for both complexes, considering the results in the osteoblast studies and the IC50 values obtained with the in vivo model of toxicity (FET test). Moreover, the cytotoxicity in cell cultures showed a decrease in mitochondrial enzymatic activities and DNA damage could also be observed by comet formation in MC3T3-E1 cells while this effect could not be observed in the osteosarcoma cells. Additionally, VO(NH2O)2(Val) greatly enhanced ROS levels in MC3T3-E1 and UMR106 cells, suggesting an important role for oxidative stress in the toxicity mechanism of this compound. Since VO(NH2O)2(Val) was more stable as well as less cytotoxic, both in cell cultures and in the in vivo model than VO(NH2O)2(Met), it is considered a promissory compound to be further investigated as a potential antitumoral agent.

            "text": "The effects of vanadium compounds depend on many factors, namely the pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic effect of VCs depend largely on the cell type, but also on the type of VC and its dose. The key protein, defects of which may drastically change the effects of VCs, is p53 (a large number of tumor cell types have defects in the gene encoding this protein) [11]. In p53-defective cells (tumor cells or non-tumor p53-knock out cells), VCs inhibit the cell cycle and thus induce apoptosis [263]. Activation of NF-\u03baB by ROS generated by VCs enhances the apoptotic effect [264]. In contrast, in p53-functional cells, disturbed phosphorylation of p53 leads to inhibition of apoptosis [265]. In addition, VCs stimulate the cell cycle, thus inhibiting apoptosis, as both processes are mutually connected [263]. Moreover, NF-\u03baB activation inhibits apoptosis of tumor cells. One relevant issue is that frequently VCs cause much more DNA damage in tumor cells compared to non-tumor cells when present at the same levels. Extensive DNA damage leads to apoptosis of tumor cells while a less intensive damage evoked by vanadium compounds in non-tumor cells may stimulate synthesis and activation of repair enzymes, thus protecting those cells from apoptosis [11]. The above processes promote tumor cell growth at early stages of the disease and have an antitumor effect in the advanced stages of cancer. In fact, there are studies in animals treated with carcinogens that suggest that VCs used at low levels have selective effects on the tumor cells [266], [267].",

This research involved the design of two families of VIVO-compounds including polypyridyl ligands (NN) bearing DNA intercalating capacity (Fig. 12\n). This strategy pointed out at DNA as a potential parasite target. It was inspired in the fact that compounds able to generate nucleic acids modifications have received high attention in anti-tumor drug design and in the reported metabolic similarities between tumor cells and highly proliferative trypanosomatid parasites. For instance, some compounds that efficiently interact with DNA in an intercalative mode exert anti-trypanosomal activity [274], [275], [276].",

Seventeen of the twenty-five complexes were more active than the Nifurtimox (IC50 (\u03bcM): 6.0 (Dm28c strain), 7.7 (Tulahuen 2 strain)). The compounds including aminophen were the most active ones showing IC50 values in the submicromolar range and being 9.6- to 18.5-fold more active than aminophen itself, as measured by their IC50 values in \u03bcM units. The selectivity to the parasite in respect to mammalian cells was also studied for the most relevant compounds. The phen compounds showed selectivity indexes SI (IC50 mammalian cell model/IC50\nT. cruzi) ranging between 38 and 596 using THP-1 human acute monocytic leukemia (ATCC) cells as mammalian cell models [278]. The epoxyphen and aminophen compounds showed SI values (IC50 J774 murine macrophages/IC50\nT. cruzi in the range 10\u201341 and 96\u2013185, respectively. Furthermore, none of the aminophen complexes displayed relevant toxicity against J-774 macrophages at doses down to 50 \u03bcM, depicting in all cases much higher SI values than the corresponding value for aminophen itself.

In particular, the consumption of glucose by trypanosomatid protozoa is characterized by the excretion of reduced products such as succinate, pyruvate or lactate not only in anerobiosis, but also under aerobic conditions. A compartmentation of the glycolytic enzymes, most of which are placed in an organelle called the glycosome, and a relative inefficacy of the respiratory chain has been described. Previous research on T. cruzi epimastigotes metabolism using [l-13C] glucose as substrate described the detection by 13C NMR of the carboxylates succinate, pyruvate, acetate and lactate and the amino acids Ala and Gly as main catabolites of glucose [282]. Therefore, the modifications in the excreted metabolites produced by the incubation of the parasite with the selected VIVO-compounds were followed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. An increment of excreted Gly, acetate and Ala was observed. Acetate and Gly are catabolites produced in the parasite single mitochondrion. Alanine is produced in the cytosol of the parasite cell from pyruvate that is originated in a specific parasite organelle called glycosome, via phosphoenolpyruvate. This pyruvate is also used, into the mitochondrion, in the like-Krebs cycle (Fig. 17\n) [283]. Consequently, an increment in the amount of Ala could be indicative of an increment of cytosolic pyruvate due to a deficient mitochondrion uptake emerging of deleterious effects on mitochondrion integrity. Consequently, the mitochondrion could be pointed out as a potential target for these complexes [280].",

In addition, the ligand and both metal compounds showed low toxicity on peritoneal macrophage cells used as mammalian cell models (IC50\n > 100 \u03bcM). It was hypothesized that the higher activity of these VCs may be related to either an easier uptake and/or to their higher efficacy toward their targets. On the other hand, inside cells the vanadium speciation may yield species containing or not the original ligands. The phen moiety may indeed be relevant in this respect since it improves the biological activity of the metal-based systems probably by acting as DNA intercalator. Indeed, DNA interaction ability of the phen complex was demonstrated by AFM, fluorescence spectroscopy and viscosity measurements.",

In this context, native or chemically modified polysaccharides have been studied to potentiate the immune response. A previous research by the same authors showed that VIVO complexation of galactomannan (GMPOLY), isolated from the lichen Ramalina celastri, exacerbated the cytotoxicity to intracellular Leishmania [9]. The in vitro effects of galactomannan (GALMAN-A) isolated from seeds of Mimosa scabrella and its oxidovanadium(IV/V) complex on macrophage activation and leishmanicidal activity on Leishmania (L.) amazonensis intramacrophages amastigotes were confirmed.

The internalization of glucose by the glucose transporter GLUT4, is triggered by the phosphorylated insulin receptor (IR).

By binding to PTP-1B vanadate may block PTP-1B, this restoring the signaling path. (1) Phosphate remaining bound to IR\u03b2, the insulin receptor substrate (IRS), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K, which activates protein kinase B, PKB, also known as Akt) remain phosphorilated, thus the signaling path is kept active and (2) activation of the glucose transporter remains in operation, as well as (3) translocation of GLUT4, and (4) cellular uptake of glucose by GLUT4.",
