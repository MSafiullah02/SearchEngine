Anesthesia and surgery were practiced as normal in Wuhan until the end of December 2019, when healthcare workers including anesthesiologists were alerted to an abrupt increase in cases of COVID-19. Not realizing that the virus could be transmitted from human to human, hospitals reacted with a variety of precautionary measures. Some made it mandatory to wear a N95 mask during daily work, whereas others stipulated only protective goggles or a face shield were to be used by personnel carrying out emergency intubation, with the highest level of protection reserved for those caring for patients with fever. Meanwhile, some others required suspected patients to be given a chest computed tomography study before surgery.12 Unfortunately, a lack of consensus, and hence of uniformity in precautionary requirements, meant that these protective measures were not universally adopted.",

Normally at this time of year, most operating rooms would be closed and most anesthesiologists off duty. However, this was not the case for anesthesiologists in Wuhan this year, where most hospitals had to deal with a surge in the number of patients with fever, which swiftly reached a crisis point. Emergency rooms, in-patient floors allocated to respiratory and infectious diseases, and ICUs were suddenly flooded with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases, swiftly overwhelming healthcare personnel. As hospitals mounted a large-scale recall of already discharged healthcare personnel, including anesthesiologists, the role of anesthesiologists in the outbreak became clear: to participate in acute and critical care with a focus on airway management, oxygen therapy, ventilation support, hemodynamic management, sedation, and analgesia. Some anesthesiologists, after a rapid training in infection prevention, were deployed to fever clinics and ICUs to help care for patients with confirmed or suspected infections.",

For example, on January 25, 2020, 14 hospitals were allocated to the reception of fever patients, including the West Campus of Wuhan Union Hospital, a tertiary comprehensive teaching hospital, where all anesthesiologists were deployed to the floor where COVID-19 patients were being cared for. Despite these dramatic measures, however, it quickly became apparent that the number of beds was far from adequate. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the government made the swift decision to build two new hospitals, Huo-Shen-Shan and Lei-Shen-Shan, from ground zero. However, when the beds provided by both designated hospitals and new hospitals remained inadequate to meet the sharp increase in cases, the government requisitioned building plots in the city to construct sixteen Fang Cang (\u201cmakeshift\u201d) hospitals with a capacity of more than 13,000 beds. As of February 28, 2020, approximately 12,000 patients had been admitted into Fang Cang hospitals, whereas nearly 5,600 had been discharged.14",

Healthcare workers at the frontline are mainly from public medical institutions, and thus can be mobilized by the government.

Dr. Lingzhong Meng, an anesthesiologist from Yale University School of Medicine (New Haven, Connecticut), was the first to organize a series of webinars discussing the key issues facing anesthesiologists and intensivists. The four topics addressed were: (1) whether anesthesiologists and intensivists were prepared for this outbreak (February 8, 2020); (2) how airways could be managed (February 15, 2020); (3) how lung-protective ventilation could be provided and what the goal of oxygenation was (February 22, 2020); and (4) \u201cECMO\u2014friend or foe\u201d (February 29, 2020). These webinars attracted a 30,000- to 60,000-strong audience during their live streaming and were viewed approximately 1,000,000 times within a week. The International Airway Management Society (Cherry Hill, New Jersey) also coordinated a webinar discussing airway management in the context of the outbreak on February 23, 2020.",

On February 15, 2020, the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology and Chinese Association of Anesthesiologists jointly established a platform providing free mental health advice to all anesthesia providers, capable of providing consultation to more than 200 persons per day, twice daily.17 On February 20, 2020, the two organizations jointly set up an online Q&A forum by anesthesia experts to answer questions related to infection control, to which anesthesia providers were invited to submit their questions and concerns directly.18 Taking the lead, the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology and Chinese Association of Anesthesiologists also issued the \u201cAnesthesia and Nursing Standard Operation Protocol in Operating Rooms for Patients with Suspected and Confirmed COVID-19,\u201d and other best practices to minimize the risk of contamination have also been quickly developed and published.19 Among these, the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology Task Force on Airway Management issued its \u201cRecommendations for Tracheal Intubation in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients (Version 1.0),\u201d20 and the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology Pediatric Anesthesiology Task Force and Youth Committee jointly issued the \u201cPediatric Anesthesia-related Specifications during the COVID-19 Epidemic.\u201d21 Meanwhile, the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology and Chinese Association of Anesthesiologists have organized lectures to share ideas and discuss relevant issues using different remote conferencing platforms and WeChat, the most popular social media site in China. The topics covered include practice guidelines and recommendations, infection control, self-protection, and operating room management. The goal of these efforts was to ensure that all perioperative providers understood and would abide by the necessary procedures and precautions.",

These donations were later extended to the entire province of Hubei and those parts of China where the epidemic was most severe. In total, the New Youth Anesthesia Forum donated medical masks, protective clothes, goggles, disinfectants, and other material worth 200,000 RMB to more than 50 anesthesia departments. Moreover, it played a pivotal role in providing online streaming for lectures organized by different groups of anesthesiologists on topics covering airway management, perioperative infection control, obstetric anesthesia, caring for mothers with confirmed infection, lung-protective ventilation, and the use of ultrasound in critically ill patients.22 These online lectures attracted an average of 30,000 audience members, which represent about 40% of all anesthesiologists practicing in China, and this continuous online education program has played an important role in preparing anesthesiologists and intensivists to deal with the outbreak.",
