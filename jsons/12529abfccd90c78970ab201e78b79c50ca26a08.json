After oral ingestion, the coronaviral strain LY-138 infected the absorptive epithelial cell lining of the intestinal villi resulting in atrophy of the villi, decrease in height and extensive sloughing of intestinal epithelial cells that resulted in some denuding. The basis of this change is obviously the excessive rate of cell death from the cytocidal action of the coronavirus.",

This feature was seen in intestinal chlamydial infections of calves (5). Clubbing and fusion of villi, edema, cell infiltration of the lamina propria as well as festooning and fragmentation of the basal lamnia were features also found in the intestinal chlamydial infections of calves. Finally, the hypertrophy and dilation of the crypts of Lieberkuhn were observed in intestinal chlamydial (4, 5) and parvoviral infections (2, 12). It becomes more and more evident that intestinal infections with viruses or chlamydial agents should be studied and compared on a cell biological and ultrastructural basis. Summary Seven conventional newborn calves were inoculated orally with the coronavirus strain LY-138, originally recovered from naturally-infected diarrheic calves. All calves developed diarrhea during the first 24 h after Zbl. Vet. Med., Reihe B, Bd. 24, Heft 5inoculation. The presence and excretion of virus was monitored by electron microscopy.Grossly, the changes were subtle and not striking. The intestinal tract was distended and contained a yellow clear fluid. The small intestinal wall was thin and transparent.Histologic changes were characterized by atrophy and fusion of the villi, decreased height and vacuolation of the intestinal epithelial cells, by a reduced number of goblet cells, crypt hypertrophy and dilatation, and by edema and increased cellularity of the lamina propria mucosae.Ultrastructurally the viral agent infected the intestinal absorptive epithelial cells, undifferentiated epithelial cells and goblet cells of the villi, and occasionally fibroblasts and endothelial cells of the lamina propria mucosae. Morphologic evidence indicated that virus multiplication occurred only in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum became dilated, and electron-dense, granulo-fibrillar material filled their cysternae to form smooth membrane-bounded viral factories in the supranuclear cytoplasm of infected intestinal epithelial cells. Ultrastructural cytologic changes in this viral infection consisted of dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum network, cellular ribosome depletion, extensive endoplasmic vacuolation and vesiculation of Golgi elements of intestinal epithelial cells, swelling and degeneration of mitochondria, loss of normal nuclear polarity with pyknosis and karyolysis of the nuclei, loss of cytoplasmic matrix, and a broad spectrum of pathologic changes involving the microvilli and terminal web.",
