A wide range of pathogens are involved in BRD, including bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPI3), Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni and Mycoplasma bovis (Angen et al., 2009, Friis and Krogh, 1983, Kusiluka et al., 2000, Larsen et al., 1999, Tegtmeier et al., 1999).

In recent investigations, 10% of calf mortalities in an Irish study were attributed to BRD, and a prevalence of 45.9% and incidence of 10.1% was found for BRD in the United Kingdom (Johnson et al., 2017). BRD can be controlled by several strategies such as correct use of colostrum (Pardon et al., 2015) or vaccination programs (Richeson et al., 2008). The widespread use of antimicrobials for BRD treatment and control (De Briyne et al., 2014) represents one of the major uses of antimicrobials in food producing animals (Fulton, 2009, Nickell and White, 2010).",

However, false negative results are commonly encountered as the causal bacteria may be fastidious or slow growing, and possibly overgrown by other organisms (Bell et al., 2014, Kugadas et al., 2014, Shanthalingam et al., 2014, Tegtmeier et al., 2000). While serological assays such as ELISA are frequently used to indicate prior infection with M. bovis, false negative results in early infection occur as seroconversion normally takes two weeks or more (Howard et al., 1986, Petersen et al., 2018). A wide range of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been developed to test individually for each of the pathogens involved in BRD (Amer et al., 2013, Bell et al., 2014, Klem et al., 2019, Kishimoto et al., 2017, Rahpaya et al., 2018). However, testing for multiple BRD pathogens in separate assays is prohibitively expensive for livestock producers. To overcome this problem, a multiplex PCR assay has recently been developed (Zhang et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Although individual bacterial or viral pathogens can cause disease alone, mixed infections are most common and problematic in BRD. A rapid diagnosis of these pathogens is also essential in the implementation of appropriate treatment and control measures. Conventional PCR is problematic because pathogens can be present in both healthy and diseased calves. In other situations with multi-agent diseases with opportunistic pathogens, quantification of the pathogens in clinical specimens has added substantially to the value of microbiological diagnosis (Lima et al., 2016, Pedersen et al., 2014, Pedersen et al., 2013). Recently, a multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) method to detect relevant bacterial pathogens of BRD was published, demonstrating better performance than culture in co-infections with two or more pathogens (Loy et al., 2018). To offer a quick and complete laboratory result of multiple BRD pathogens, a set of two commercially available multiplex qPCR assays has been developed under the name Pneumo4 (DNA Diagnostic A/S, Risskov, Denmark). These multiplex qPCR kits (Pneumo4B and Pneumo4V) can specifically detect and quantitate four bacterial (M. haemolytica, P. multocida, H. somni, M. bovis) and five viral (BPI3, BCoV, BRSV, BoHV-1 and BVDV) pathogens, respectively, which are most frequently associated with BRD. In this study, the performance of the Pneumo4 kits was evaluated by comparing the results of test of field samples with bacterial culture and PCR tests for M. bovis and BPI3, BCoV and BRSV routinely used in Denmark as reference standard methods.",

            "text": "The Pneumo4 assays were developed to provide rapid, effective detection of pathogens involved in BRD. For a total of nine pathogens the Pneumo4B and Pneumo4V multiplex qPCR assays can be run at the same time under the same PCR program, with benefits in costs and processing time for a diagnostic laboratory compared to multiple singleplex qPCR assays run in parallel. However, the efficiency and sensitivity of a multiplex PCR can be compromised due to primer and probe sets interfering, or the competition for the components in the reaction (Kalle et al., 2014, Parker et al., 2015). In this study, the commercially-available multiplex qPCR Pneumo4B and Pneumo4V assays demonstrated that their efficiencies for seven of these target pathogens (93\u2013106% and 91\u2013104%, respectively) were comparable to those of published singleplex qPCR assays (84.2\u2013101.8%) (Kishimoto et al., 2017). Pneumo4B and Pneumo4V were able to detect between 10 copies of genomic DNA and 10\u201350 copies of target RNA per reaction, respectively, which are comparable to previously established methods which reported of 100\u2013250 copies per reaction (Rahpaya et al., 2018). The qPCR efficiency was also similar to multiplex qPCR assays reported by others (Cornelissen et al., 2017, Wisselink et al., 2017).",

These results suggest bacteria were present, but were undetected by culture possibly due to their fastidious nature or overgrowth by other organisms on culture (Bell et al., 2014, Van Driessche et al., 2017). PCR methods such as Pneumo4B are likely to overcome the effects of accompanying flora, and detect pathogens in mixed samples where traditional culture fails (Loy et al., 2018). The limitations of culture as a reference standard assay must be considered when determining the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of Pneumo4B. If Pneumo4B correctly identified bacterial species undetected by culture, the specificity of the Pneumo4B assay would be underestimated. A similar number of samples (n\n = 15) were positive for M. haemolytica, P. multocida or H. somni by culture and negative in the Pneumo4B assays (Table 1), confirming that qPCR can result in false negative results, as previously reported (Bell et al., 2014). Explanations for this could be primer/probe mis-matches, degradation of nucleic acids during storage or handling, or technical errors during extraction.",

However, some target bacteria could have sequence substitutions at the primer or probe recognition sites. Since the primer sequences have not been released by the company, we have no means of investigating this. According to the company, primer design included comparison of all available genome sequences of the target bacteria, and we did not observe any problems with the bacterial cultures used in kit testing. PCR inhibitors may also have caused these results, as we found some samples with culture positive/PCR negative results had unacceptably low PCR signals from the internal amplification control (IAC) (no signal or Ct >32), and became PCR positive on retesting after a 5 fold dilution of the DNA extract. However in our methods comparisons, we classified such samples as PCR negative.",

However, in samples positive by both methods, Pneumo4B gave results 3\u20134 Ct values lower than results of standard PCR (Supplementary Table 3), suggesting this assay has a higher sensitivity for M. bovis than the reference method. Several factors influence PCR efficiency, such as sample storage and transport, differences in materials (Buzard et al., 2012) and reagents including DNA preparation method (Bowman et al., 2016, Dilhari et al., 2017). These may explain the sensitivity difference between the two methods for M. bovis detection and the moderate agreement of the two assays is also consistent with the Pneumo4B assay being more sensitive than the reference standard reference.",

These differ in sensitivity and specificity, with none an optimal reference standard able to detect all viruses in all clinical situations. In this study, we used the official Danish qPCR viral detection protocols, for which the National Veterinary Laboratory is accredited, as reference standard reference singleplex assays. In comparison to these standard methods, the Pneumo4V multiplex assay was equally or slightly more sensitive. Some samples (n\n = 9) were positive for BPI3, BCoV or BRSV by Pneumo4V PCR and negative in standard PCRs, whereas only one was positive by standard PCR and negative by Pneumo4V. The Ct values of these positive samples were \u226530 (Supplementary Table 3). We cannot rule out that a high Ct may be generated through cross-contamination or by nonspecific amplification with other viral species not tested in this study. The nucleic acid extraction protocol included with Pneumo4 assays does not include high speed centrifugation in the initial step; however, this is also the case for the NVI protocol. It is unlikely that the Pneumo4V extraction protocol harvests free virus particles, as this requires centrifugation speeds of >30,000 g (Payne, 2018). However, since sick calves have high numbers of virus-infected neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes in the lung (Blod\u00f6rn et al., 2015), enough target particles are likely to be obtained.",

For routine use in BoHV-1/BVDV free countries, it is important that the BoHV-1/BVDV assays have high specificities because false-positive detections can have regulatory and trade implications.
