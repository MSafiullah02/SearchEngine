World Health Organization reports expenditure of more than $468 million in 2012\u20132013 to control the spread of infectious diseases [5], and funds for treatment and research emerging infectious diseases are huge and increasing. It is thus important to investigate effective control strategies that can prevent outbreaks or minimize the cost.",

Since the first outbreaks in China in early 2003 SARS had spread rapidly across China into southeast Asia and even the world, and SARS was the first severe new disease of the 21st century, so we take SARS as an example of emerging infectious disease in this paper. In the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak, only a very few number of individuals infected by SARS, and the early symptoms were very similar to flu and could not be diagnosed by medical personnel.",

On the prevention and treatment for SARS, the effective and essential measures including heightened surveillance, early detection and treatment of cases, and infection control in all health facilities have been applied. Although the emergency ambulances including development of effective drugs and rapid tools for diagnosis provided a safe and reliable mobile medical treatment platform for tacking SARS, it would put pressure on limited medical resources such as doctors, hospital beds, isolation places and bring grave challenges to each country, especially in rural areas in many developing countries [6], [7], [8], [9]. For example, it was a serious challenge for medical personnel to diagnose the patients who were infected by SARS or flu with the similar signs and symptoms such as coughs, colds, fevers and so on. Those required a lot of medical resources, which undoubtedly worse the already grave situation. Thus, medical resource limitation seriously restricted the prevention and treatment for SARS.",

We initially preclude the existence of the first type of limit cycle, i.e., limit cycle totally in region S1 or S2. Denote the right-hand side of system Si by f(i)(Z), where f(i)(Z)=(f1(i)(Z),f2(i)(Z)),i=1,2.Lemma 5.1\nThere exists no limit cycle totally composed by the orbit of the vector field\nFSi(Z),i=1,2\n.\n\nProofLet the Dulac function be B(S,I1)=1/(SI1) for subsystem Si, we have\u2202(Bf1(i))\u2202S+\u2202(Bf2(i))\u2202I1=-AS2I1<0,so there is no limit cycle totally in region Si for i=1,2. Therefore, there exists no limit cycle totally composed by the orbit of the vector field FS1(Z) or FS2(Z). This completes the proof of Lemma 5.1. \u25a1Next, we preclude the existence of the second type of limit cycles.\nLemma 5.2\nThere exists no limit cycle surrounding a sliding segment, which contains a tangent point only or part of a sliding segment.\n\nProofIn order to proof Lemma 5.2, we consider the following three cases.\nCase i: Assume that I\u22172<Ic<I\u22171, i.e., H1<c2<H2. It follows that there exists a pseudo-equilibrium EP which is locally asymptotically stable in the sliding domain \u03a3s. The local stability of EP on the sliding domain indicates that the conclusion in Lemma 5.2 follows.\nCase ii: Assume that Ic<I\u22172, i.e., c2<H1.In the sliding domain \u03a3s (here the segment ET1ET2\u203e in Fig. 5\n), we haveS\u02d9(t)=A-\u03bcS-\u03b21SIc>0,which shows that the trajectory moves from the left to the right on \u03a3s.We should show that the orbit l1 initiating at ET2 will not hit the sliding domain \u03a3s again. Note that the orbit l1 starting at ET2 either tends to the stable equilibrium ER2 directly or spirally since ER2 could be a stable node or focus in region S2. If the latter happens, then the orbit l1 intersects with the horizontal isocline gI2 as the point M1 first, and N1 second, where N1 is on the segment ET2ER2\u203e. Obviously, the two points M1 and N1 are above the point ET2. Hence, l1 starting at ET2 cannot form a cycle, as shown in Fig. 5.\nCase iii: Assume that Ic>I\u22171, i.e., c2>H2. We can use a similar process as Case ii to prove the conclusion.Therefore, the combination of Cases i\u2013iii, there exists no limit cycle contains a tangent point only or part of a sliding segment. This completes the proof of Lemma 5.2. \u25a1In order to preclude the existence of the third type of limit cycle, we give the following lemma and detailed proof.\nLemma 5.3\nThere exists no limit cycle surrounding the whole sliding segment.\n\nProofWe supposed that Filippov system (7) has a limit cycle \u0393 in \u03a9, and \u0393 surrounds the sliding segment T1T2\u203e. As shown in Fig. 6\n, \u0393 is divided into two parts \u03931 and \u03932 by the manifold \u03a3, we denote the intersection points by H1 and H2. Meanwhile, the intersection points between \u0393 and the auxiliary line I1=Ic-\u220a (or I1=Ic+\u220a) are A1,A2 (or A3,A4), where \u220a>0 is sufficiently small. The region bounded by \u03931 (or \u03932) and segment A1A2 (or A3A4) is denoted with G1 (or G2), and we denote the boundary of G1 (or G2) by L1 (or L2), respectively, and the directions indicated in Fig. 6. Let the Dulac function be B=1/(SI1), it follows from Green\u2019s theorem that\u222b\u222bG1\u2202(Bf1(1))\u2202S+\u2202(Bf2(1))\u2202I1dSdI1=B\u222eL1f1(1)dI1-f2(1)dS=-\u222bA2A1\u2192Bf2(1)dS.Similarly, we have\u222b\u222bG2\u2202(Bf1(2))\u2202S+\u2202(Bf2(2))\u2202I1dSdI1=-\u222bA3A4\u2192Bf2(2)dS.If G0\u2282G1, we have\u03be\u225c\u222b\u222bG0\u2202(Bf1(1))\u2202S+\u2202(Bf2(1))\u2202I1dSdI1<0,then we obtain(13)0>\u03be>\u222b\u222bG1\u2202(Bf1(1))\u2202S+\u2202(Bf2(1))\u2202I1dSdI1+\u222b\u222bG2\u2202(Bf1(2))\u2202S+\u2202(Bf2(2))\u2202I1dSdI1=-\u222bA2A1\u2192Bf2(1)dS-\u222bA3A4\u2192Bf2(2)dS.For the sake of simplicity of computation, we denote the abscissas of the points H1,H2,A1,A2,A3,A4 by x1,x2,x1+h1(\u220a),x2-h2(\u220a),x1+h3(\u220a),x2-h4(\u220a), where hi(\u220a)>0 is continuous and satisfies lim\u220a\u21920hi(\u220a)=0 for i=1,2,3,4. Thus, we havelim\u220a\u21920-\u222bA2A1\u2192Bf2(1)dS=lim\u220a\u21920\u222bx1+h1(\u220a)x2-h2(\u220a)\u03b21-\u03bd+c11+b2kSdS=lim\u220a\u21920\u03b2(x2-h2(\u220a)-x1-h1(\u220a))-\u03bd+c11+b2klnx2-h2(\u220a)x1+h1(\u220a)=\u03b2(x2-x1)-\u03bd+c11+b2klnx2x1.Analogously, we getlim\u220a\u21920-\u222bA3A4\u2192Bf2(2)dS=\u03b2(x1-x2)+(\u03bd+c1)lnx2x1.Therefore,lim\u220a\u21920-\u222bA2A1\u2192Bf2(1)dS-\u222bA3A4\u2192Bf2(2)dS=c1b2k1+b2klnx2x1>0which contradicts with (13). This precludes the existence of the limit cycle. This completes the proof of Lemma 5.3.\n",

We initially show that ER1 is globally asymptotically stable as following.Theorem 5.4\nFor Filippov system\n(7)\n, the endemic equilibrium\nER1\nis globally asymptotically stable if\nc2>H2\n(i.e.,\nIc>I\u22171\n).\n\nProofBy calculation, the two endemic equilibria ER1 and EV2 for two structures lie on the same side of \u03a3 as c2>H2. Although there exists the sliding domain \u03a3s in \u03a9, no pseudo-equilibrium exists in \u03a3s. The endemic equilibrium ER1 is locally asymptotically stable in S1 since R01>1. It follows from the sliding domain \u03a3s thatS\u02d9(t)=A-\u03bcS-\u03b21SIc<0,which indicates that the trajectory moves from the right to the left on the sliding segment ET1ET2\u203e (see Fig. 7\n).Noting that H3\u2a7dH4,H1\u2a7dH2,H1\u2a7dH3,H2\u2a7dH4. Then, either H3<H2 or H3>H2 may hold true. For different sets of values of the parameters, the sliding segment may be exclusively, partly, or totally in the invariance region \u03a9, so we consider the following three cases.\nCase i. If c2>H4 (the region \u03a91 shown in Fig. 1), the sliding segment ET1ET2\u203e lies in \u03a9, as shown in Fig. 7(A).According to Lemma 5.1, Lemma 5.2, Lemma 5.3, we can preclude the existence of three types limit cycles listed above. Hence, the endemic equilibrium ER1 is globally asymptotically stable.\nCase ii. If max{H2,H3}<c2<H4 (the region \u03a92 shown in Fig. 1), the part of the sliding segment ET1ET2\u203e lies in \u03a9, as shown in Fig. 7(B). Note that again the direction of the vector field in region S2\u22c2\u03a9 points downward. Moreover, according to Lemma 5.2, we know that there exists no closed orbit containing part of the sliding segment ET1ET2\u203e. Hence, the endemic equilibrium ER1 is globally asymptotically stable.\nCase iii. If c2<max{H2,H3} (the region \u03a93 shown in Fig. 1), the sliding segment is out of \u03a9, as shown in Fig. 7(C).The two endemic equilibria ER1 and EV2 lie in S1\u2229\u03a9, and the direction of the vector field in S2\u2229\u03a9 points downward. Hence, there exists no limit cycle in \u03a9 which is partly in S1 and partly in S2. In addition, by Lemma 5.1, there is no limit cycle totally in S1. Therefore, the endemic equilibrium ER1 is globally asymptotically stable.Note that both ER1 and EV2 lie in S1, which indicate that all trajectories will attain the subregion of \u03a9 below the manifold \u03a3. Moreover, they will remain in it and approach the endemic equilibrium ER1. Hence ER1 is globally asymptotically stable. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.4. \u25a1Next, we will show that EP is globally asymptotically stable in the sliding domain \u03a3s as following.\nTheorem 5.5\nFor Filippov system\n(7)\n, the pseudo-equilibrium\nEP\nis globally asymptotically stable if\nH1<c2<H2\n(i.e.,\nI\u22172<Ic<I\u22171\n).\n\nProofIt is easy to see that both equilibria E1 and E2 are virtual (i.e., EV1 and EV2), and the pseudo-equilibrium EP exists in \u03a3s which is locally asymptotically stable. Note that the sliding segment \u03a3s may be partly or totally in \u03a9. Then there are two possibilities to consider.\nCase i. If c2\u2a7emin{H2,H3} (the region \u03a94 shown in Fig. 1), and part of the sliding segment ET1ET2\u203e lies in \u03a9, as shown in Fig. 8\n(A), we can preclude the existence of limit cycles by using a similar method to Case ii in Theorem 5.4.\nCase ii. If c2<min{H2,H3} (the region \u03a95 shown in Fig. 1), and the whole sliding segment lies in \u03a9, as shown in Fig. 8(B). We can rule out the existence of limit cycles surrounds \u03a3s by Lemma 5.3.From what we have discussed above, there exists no limit cycle in \u03a9. Hence, the pseudo-equilibrium EP is globally asymptotically stable. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.5. \u25a1Finally, we show that ER2 is globally asymptotically stable as following.\nTheorem 5.6\nFor Filippov system\n(7)\n, the endemic equilibrium\nER2\nis globally asymptotically stable if\nc2<H1\n(i.e.,\nIc<I\u22172\n).\n\nProofIf c2<H1 (the region \u03a96 shown in Fig. 1), and the whole sliding segment lies in \u03a9, as shown in Fig. 9\n.Obviously, there exist two endemic equilibria EV1 and ER2 and no pseudo-equilibrium. The sliding mode \u03a3s does exist, and the trajectory moves from left to right on ET1ET2\u203e in this case, as shown in Fig. 9. Using a similar method to Case i of Theorem 5.4, we can rule out the existence of limit cycle totally in \u03a9. Hence, the endemic equilibrium ER2 is globally asymptotically stable. This completes the proof of Theorem 5.6. \u25a1\nRemarkIf R01<1, Filippov system (7) will stabilize at E0 which is the disease-free equilibrium of free system S1 (as shown in Fig. 10\n). In fact, if R01<1, Filippov system (7) does not have any regular equilibrium and sliding segment. According to Lemma 5.1, there exists no limit cycle for Filippov system (7). Consequently all the trajectories of Filippov system (7) will definitely hit the switching surface \u03a3, and finally stabilize at the boundary equilibrium E0 of free system S1.\n",
