In the plantations studied, mainly of Norway spruce and Scots pine mixed with some European larch and a few deciduous trees, we were able to study the development of the bird community from bare pasture up to a forest of about 20 years of age. Although some German ecologists (cf. Tischler 1955) are of opinion that such a study of succession is not dynamic, this comparison of areas at different stages of development is the only possible way; for-as Yapp (1955) states-it would be indeed impossible for one man to follow through the complete succession in a single wood. The first group, bare pastures, is characterized by the dominance of the mat-grass, with here and there crippled spruce and juniper or hawthorn. Only small patches-usually the moist ones-are utilized as meadows for hay, the others being intensively grazed and in most parts burned off in early spring. The solitary trees and shrubs are suitable for the nesting, singing or shelter of some birds while the rocks and groups of stones are suitable for others. The ground breeders are not abundant, for the grass is short and overgrazed, the surface constantly disturbed and burned. The rock breeders and the birds nesting among stones are more protected and more abundant. Small rodents are abundant, firstly the Ground Squirrel Citellus citellus, with an average summer population of about 15 individuals (over 4 kg. biomass) per hectare (Turkk 1955), secondly the Field Vole Microtus arvalis. This abundance is responsible for the high density of raptorial birds, but it is only temporary, as the squirrels are below ground October-March and the voles below the snow in winter. A second seasonal food-supply consists of Saltatoria from about mid-July to October, and a minor one of spiders March to May. Owing to these nutritional circumstances most of the bird species are carnivorous and omnivorous, while the herbivorous species are almost absent or forage outside the pastures. Thus, the Goldfinch Carduelis carduelis forages there for thistle seeds in late summer, while the Linnet C. cannabina forages in relatively distant fields. While most of the mamma1 species are herbivorous there, most of the bird species are carnivorous and insectivorous, owing to the abundance of herbivoroug 1957 591 mammals and insects, respectively. As shown in Table 3 , most of the bird species utilize the bare pastures for foraging only, as e.g. the thrushes, Starling Sturnus vulgaris, crows and Magpie Pica pica as well as birds of prey.",

Grass disappears except on open patches, the ground is covered with fallen needles and seedlings of shrubs or trees, mainly broadleaved, begin to appear owing to dissemination by animals, mainly birds. Sixteen new species of forest-birds come in. The change from group (2), which is ecologically a shrubby pasture, into forest both physiognomically and ecologically, occurs in about six to ten years after planting. The forest species of birds, such as tits, Cuckoo, Turtle Dove (nesting) now appear; but it is only after ten years, when the first cones are formed, that the first seedeating species, such as the Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopus major (and the squirrel Sciurus m~uis) colonize. The last newcomers-after about 15 to 20 years-are the Hazel Grouse Tetrastes bonasia (seeking cover) and Chaffinch Fringilla coehbs (for nesting). Since for tits there is no suitable nesting site, only the Coal Tit Parus ater is present, nesting in the ground. I n this late group of birds belongs also the Greenfinch Chloris chloris, which prefers, too, spruce. As the grass disappears from the floor, the roosting and burying birds, namely the thrushes and the Jay Garrutusglandmius, have IBIS 99 an important role at this time. Blackbirds Twdus merukz, in particular, regularly roost at this group of plantations during the non-breeding season and in their faeces they disseminate many plants, such as Taxus, Sambunrs, Rosa, Cratuegus, Jutriperus, Rubrrs, Ribes, Pnmus. On the other hand, Jays bury there many acorns of oaks (mainly Qwrcus sesdzk) and beech-nuts in September and October. On three sample plots, each 100m. square, I found in autumn 1956 from 51 to 83 seedlings and saplings of 13 treespecies, carried there by birds. Thus, the forming of a shrub layer or stratum is in this'case the almost exclusive r6le of birds, so that they are of great importance in seral stages. Group (3) is the highest in number of bird species and individuals, but the biomass of birds is slightly lower than in the first group. The distribution of bird species according to their ecological requirements (Table 3) is more regular, without the extremes of group Here again, (cf. TurEek 1956) . the species dominant numerically are not those dominant in biomass and each group is dominated to some degree by bird species common to all three groups, i.e. by the species ecologically the most valent.",

The most striking difference between the English and Slovakian plantations is the absence of the Willow Warbler PhyZloscopus irochiZus from the plantations described here. This may be due to geographical and ecological causes. In the area studied (and southwards to the Danube) the Willow Warbler is abundant only during the migrations (less in autumn than spring), and mainly in localities with flowering willows and poplars. As a nesting species it is absent in the south and in the area studied it is confined to moist young forest stands, mainly mixed, its density rising with the altitude, up to about 1300m. a.s.1. (the limit of beech and most deciduous trees). Now, the areas in our three groups are extremely dry, the plantations up to about ten years after planting having a heavy grass floor, and are not dense enough to be favourable for this warbler. Probably still other factora are responsible. It might be concluded that the WilIow Warbler is in this case compensated for by the two whitethroats, as is the Nightingale Lust3m.a megmhynchar in the heavily inundated parts of bottomland woods around the (1) and (2).",
