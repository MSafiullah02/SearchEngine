On April 15 th , 2020 the search terms \"slit lamp breath shield\", \"breath shield\", and \"ophthalmology\" were used to survey the English language literature on Google Scholar, PubMed and MEDLINE (Ovid). Articles from all years were searched. The Michael Garron Hospital Research Ethics Board (REB) deemed the study REB exempt. We complied with all ethical research principles compatible with the Declaration of Helsinki, although no human experimentation was involved. Five different commercially available polyethylene terephthalate slit lamp breath shields were purchased online from ChinRestPaperSource, Hillsboro, OR: Reichert and Keeler (AMBC2P, Panfundus, Inc., Hillsboro, OR), Haag-Streit Regular (AMBC4P, Panfundus, Inc., Hillsboro, OR), Haag-Streit Improved (AMBC5P, Panfundus, Inc., Hillsboro, OR), Universal Small (AMBUS1P, Panfundus, Inc., Hillsboro, OR), and Universal Large (AMBUL1P Panfundus, Inc., Hillsboro, OR). The breath shields were chosen based on popularity using the website reviews. The largest commercially available breath shield we found, the \"Zombie Shield,\" (AMBUZ, Panfundus, Inc., Hillsboro, OR), was also the most expensive, and has been advertised for use during the COVID-19 pandemic. 5 Prior to the pandemic, conventional breath shields were much smaller than this size. Due to budget constraints, we simulated the dimensions of the sixth shield from cardboard. A seventh shield design was a repurposed disposable plastic salad container lid and had edges that curved towards the examiner at roughly 35 o .",

The aforementioned slit lamp dimensions were averaged to make a dimensionally accurate cardboard slit lamp simulation. Our spray would be directed at the cardboard phantom at the height of the average menton-subnasale length (vertical height from the chin to nares) that was determined from the literature. 6 The angular dispersion of droplet spray from a sneeze on the breath shield was estimated using two methods: i) published slow-motion videos 7 and ii) measuring the angle of vapor condensation on a window 26 cm from the authors' lips on a cold day. A spray gun (\"Nicely Neat,\" Mr. Mister, Seattle, WA) was used to simulate a patient sneeze. The nozzle of the spray bottle was adjusted to our derived dispersion angle, and the air pump was preloaded with 20 actuations to ensure a consistent force of spray at each breath shield. The speed of the spray was calculated from observing slow-motion video footage of the spray shot at 60 frames per second. The spray bottle was filled with water mixed with green food coloring dye.",

The cardboard slit lamp model was placed at the appropriate distance and height from the spray gun, and white poster paper was positioned directly behind the oculars of the cardboard slit lamp model to catch any overspray. The cardboard phantom was sprayed without a breath shield to establish our baseline control area of spray. The measurement was repeated three times, each time using a new piece of poster paper. Then each breath shield was placed at its intended position, either on the objective lens arm or hanging off the oculars and tested three times. Figure 1 shows the cardboard slit lamp and spray bottle setup. The area of spray was photographed immediately after the spray ( Figure 2 ). Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Inc., Mountain View, California) was used to determine the surface area of the green colorant. The color range function and Euclidean distances were used to calculate differences within the color space. 8 Any gravitational leakage of the colorant after the initial spray impression was accounted for. The average surface area from all three sets was calculated for each breath shield (see Table) .",

COVID-19 viral loads can be high in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, 14 suggesting universal precautions should be taken at the slit lamp regardless of whether or not patients are symptomatic, although the risk of ocular transmission of infection from tears of patients without conjunctivitis is purported to be low. 15 Patients are advised to no longer talk during slit lamp exams. Examiners may be especially vulnerable when patients hyperventilate, cough, or sneeze at the slit lamp. Due to the photic sneeze reflex (or ACHOO Syndrome), estimated to occur in 18-35% of the population, 16 ophthalmologists may be at risk when exposing patients to bright lights. Sneezing may also occur with periocular injections due to the sternutatory reflex. 17 This is the first study to our knowledge that compares the designs of various slit lamp breath shields in the setting of a simulated ophthalmic exam. We demonstrate that commercially available slit lamp breath shields may not block up to 54% of a 47 o angle simulated oronasal spray. In this study, the more anteriorly fixed breath shields at the plane of the objective lens arm were more effective than the posteriorly positioned ocular shields of comparable size, consistent with \"ray tracing\" geometric principles (Figure 3) . In our simulation, there was a 10cm horizontal distance between breath shields attached to the objective lens arm versus breath shields hung by the oculars.",

Ideally the patient and physician should both have face masks during the slit lamp exam, but when there is a shortage of PPE, the breath shields become even more important. As each slit lamp may be unique, the study results from the average dimensions of our cardboard phantom may not apply to other bio microscopes. We only simulated a straight-ahead spray; in reality, patients may sneeze at angles not blocked by the shield or slit lamp. Additionally, our spray velocity was 2m/s, but sneezes can achieve a velocity of 35 m/s (126 km/h) 7 . There was some variation in the spray measurements which we tried to minimize with three serial tests. We also could not quantify the volume of the overspray, which might correspond with the viral load -only the area. This is a limitation of the usage of imagery to capture the amount of overspray, as Adobe Photoshop cannot quantify the volume of water on the poster paper. Finally, we cannot account for the effects of microdroplets and aerosolization, which have been suggested as possible routes of transmission of COVID-19. Microdroplets are spread during a regular conversation and can rise high in the air and circulate well beyond the breath shield to reach the examiner. 18 The COVID-19 virus has been shown to stay viable in aerosols for at least 3 hours under experimental conditions in a Goldberg drum. 19 Slit lamp breath shields should be combined with infection control measures and PPE. 20 Patients should be pre-screened for symptoms of COVID-19 before arriving at the office, sit two meters away from other patients, wear a face covering, and minimize any talking during the slit lamp exam. Ophthalmologists should use appropriate PPE including gloves, eye protection, surgical mask, or N95 respirator when necessary. Additionally, there should be proper ventilation in clinics and waiting areas, frequent handwashing, and proper disinfection of surfaces frequently touched by healthcare workers and patients -in addition to the breath shield. 21 We demonstrated that commercially available slit lamp breath shields may allow up to 54% of overspray contamination. Breath shields that are attached to the objective lens arm can be made larger to offer more protection but can impede access to slit lamp controls. We did not combine breath shields at the objective arm and plane of the oculars together, but this can be done. A breath shield that curves towards the examiner such as our repurposed plastic lid design might better protect the examiner's face from eccentric sneezes. Breath shields should still be used in conjunction with other infection control measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Further research into protective devices against COVID-19 microdroplets is encouraged. ",
