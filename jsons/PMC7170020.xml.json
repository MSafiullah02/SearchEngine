In the United States, since the first case was detected in Washington, DC, in mid-January 2020, the virus has continued to spread. As of March 19, 2020, a total of 10,442 confirmed cases have been reported in 54 jurisdictions (50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and US Virgin Islands) and has resulted in 150 deaths [1]. On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared 2019-nCoV a pandemic, citing more than 118,000 cases of the coronavirus illness in more than 110 countries and territories around the world and the sustained risk of further global spread.",

These effects may persist among affected individuals long after the outbreak has been controlled. Furthermore, contact tracing and the mandatory quarantine isolation for two weeks, which is a crucial part of the public health responses to the 2019-nCoV pneumonia outbreak, could be a precursor for increased psychological distress such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and anger among suspected or confirmed cases [3,4]. Also, the estimated global economic shutdown and recession is expected to heighten fears and anxiety.",

The literature has documented high levels of psychological distress among healthcare workers in previous outbreaks. They may experience fear of contracting and spreading the virus to their families, friends or colleagues. In a cross-sectional study by Wu et al., the healthcare workers who had been quarantined, or worked in the high-risk location such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) wards, or had friends or close relatives who contracted SARS, were significantly more likely to have high post-traumatic stress symptom levels than those without these exposures [5].",

First, it is the provision of clear, accurate and updated information about the virus to both health workers and patients in order to allay their anxiety and fear. Second, robust behavioral health services should be deployed to deliver behavioral health support to patients and health workers with additional training of more healthcare professionals in psychological first aid delivery to the high-risk population. Lastly, given the present challenge of cross-infection from the onsite and face-to-face delivery of healthcare, telehealth and other remote forms of behavioral health delivery should be encouraged.",
