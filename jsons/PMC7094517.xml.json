The federal focus on public health began in 1798 when an act of the Fifth Congress of the United States established the Marine Hospital Service (1798\u20131902), whose purpose was to provide health care for sick and diseased seamen.2 In 1870, it was reorganized by combining all its hospitals under a centralized administration headquartered in Washington, DC. John Maynard Woodworth was appointed as the first supervising surgeon of the Marine Hospital Service; this position later became the US Surgeon General. Woodworth adopted a military model for his physicians, requiring them to wear uniforms and pass examinations.",

The DHHS and non-DHHS agencies, descriptions of the nurses' duties, and the number of nurses assigned are outlined in Box 2\nand in Table 1\n. Nurse officers provide direct care or perform administrative duties. For example, they provide direct clinical care in the Indian Health Service (IHS) and community health centers, the Department of Justice's Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), and US Marshals Service and the Department of Homeland Security's Division of Immigration Health Services.

Federal personnel staff the stations when deployed in support of regional, state, or local venues. Even when FMSs were in the early developmental stages, they were used in response to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Ten 250-bed adaptations of the stations were created within days of Hurricane Katrina. Although the FMSs were designed to be staffed by federal personnel, they were adapted during the hurricanes to support state-run medical needs shelters. Current plans are to expand the program to include stations that are specifically designed to support the states in providing care to evacuee populations with chronic medical conditions.

PHS nurses provided nursing care, including triage, physical assessment, medication administration, wound care, IV access and fluid administration, and activities of daily living. The patient population was diverse with many chronic medical problems, such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There were numerous individuals who were non-ambulatory, as well as those who were morbidly obese and unable to perform self care.",

The PHS deployed 256 officers from all disciplines to various locations, including the US Capitol grounds, along the National Mall, the headquarters of the DHHS, and assorted undisclosed locations. The primary on-site team was a PHS Tier 2 team, with additional staff assigned as needed. Approximately 100 members of this team were nurse officers who staffed first aid stations on the Mall or the US Capitol grounds. Others were assigned to medical stations in the DHHS building to distribute medication. In addition, the PHS nurses operated roaming BLS teams, walking in designated areas of the US Capitol and Mall. Teams were ready to provide needed care to thousands of people who attended the event. Given the diversity of the population,as well as the frigid weather conditions, the teams saw numerous cardiac, diabetic, hydration, and cold injuries. Approximately 750 patients were seen; Corps officers treated 697 of these patients, and 48% of the injuries were cold related.",
