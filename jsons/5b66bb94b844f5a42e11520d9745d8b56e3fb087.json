Most of the published literature comprises nonanatomical and segmental resections with only few case series having major hepatic resections performed by minimally invasive approach. Aim of this article is to share our technique and experience of total laparoscopic major hepatectomy. Methods It is a retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained database of 56 patients, who underwent laparoscopic major hepatectomy for various indications during 2001 to 2013. Results Of 56 patients operated, 37 had malignant disease and 19 had benign lesions with mean size of 6.0\u00b12.8 cm. Thirty-four patients underwent right hepatectomy and 22 left with mean age of 54.8\u00b115.3 years. Mean operating time was 227.4\u00b151.8 min with mean blood loss 265.5\u00b1143.4 ml and transfusion needed in 10.7 %. Pringle's maneuver was used in 19.6 % with mean occlusion time of 34.0\u00b111.4 min. Liver-specific complications were observed in 12.5 % and overall complications in 19.6 %. Mean resection margin length in malignant lesions was 2.1\u00b10.9 cm, with <1 cm margin noted in 5.4 %. Median hospital stay was 8 days (6-29) with readmission rate of 8.9 %, re-intervention rate of 5.3 % and 90 days mortality of 1.7 %. Conclusion Laparoscopic major liver resection is a formidable task. It requires considerable expertise in both, advanced laparoscopy, and liver surgery. It can be feasible, safe, and oncologically adequate in well-selected cases in experience hands.",

Sometimes, downward retraction of duodenum is necessary to have proper exposure of porta. The peritoneal reflection along the free border of lesser omentum is incised and dissected so as to expose the common bile duct, portal vein, and hepatic artery. The cystic duct and artery are dissected in Calot's triangle, clipped, and divided. The divided gall bladder is then used to retract liver cranially. As the dissection proceeds toward hilum, the right and left branches of portal vein and hepatic artery are identified. We generally follow extra-hepatic dissection to achieve inflow control. The concerned hepatic artery is divided first after ligating it doubly with silk suture or applying plastic locking clips (Hem-o-lok; Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC). Next, portal vein branch is dissected and divided using vascular stapler (White cartridge, Endo GIA, Covidien, Mansfield, MA; Echelon Endopath Stapler, Ethicon Endo-Surgery). Alternately, if there is no space to apply stapler, we ligate the portal vein branch doubly using silk suture and then divide (Figs. 2 and 3).

After placing stay sutures on either side of transaction line along inferior border of liver for retraction, liver parenchyma is divided for depth of 5-10 mm using harmonic scalpel.

The patients with concomitant liver cirrhosis were carefully selected, having CTP grade A, though, of late we started offering minimally invasive option to patients with early CTP grade B too. Of 26 patients with HCC, 11 had associated cirrhotic changes, while the majority of HCC occurred in normal livers. This is partly explained by high incidence of HCC in Asian subcontinent attributable to nonviral etiologies and equally significant number of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers. 14 The mean size of lesions was 6 cm with largest being 13 cm and mostly was single, as multifocal lesions involving extended resections were excluded.",

Surgical option was exercised as most were giant in size, symptomatic, and few had rapid progression or exophytic pattern of growth making them vulnerable for rupture. Although enucleation remained the overall procedure of choice for most of hemangiomas during the same period, resection was favored in these patients owing to combination of factors like lesion occupying almost hemi-liver, planned ligation of arterial division supplying liver segments, and suspicion of malignancy. Five patients with final histology of complex cyst also underwent LLR mainly in view of atypical imaging findings like altered vascularity patterns and complex septations mimicking cancerous lesions, which otherwise hardly forms an indication for major hepatectomy.",

In our study, mean blood loss was 265.5 ml with transfusion required in 10.1 % of the patients. It is widely accepted today that the excess blood loss and transfusion are an independent prognostic markers for morbidity, perioperative outcome, mortality, and even recurrence after hepatectomy. 16 -18 The authors believe that the reduced blood loss in current study is mainly contributed by positive pneumoperitoneal pressure, careful patient selection, sound anatomical dissection, and judicious use of various transection and hemostatic devices. As mentioned earlier, we do not use routine inflow occlusion during parenchymal transaction. The cases mentioned were part of our initial experience as well as certain situations which mandated its use. We had three conversions to open approach, constituting 5.3 %. Reported conversion rate for major hepatectomy worldwide varies considerably but approximately comes at 10.0 %. 2 We had a little experience in assisted LLR or use of hand ports, as all completed LLR were by total laparoscopy. But, literature shows favorability of these assisted techniques in certain scenarios like assisted LLR for cirrhotics, with difficult tumor locations and in living donor hepatectomies. Hand assistance was particularly mentioned to be useful during initial learning curve. 19 Authors would like to stress the importance of keeping low threshold for conversion at least during early experience, especially considering the amount of complexity involved along with required learning curve. It is advisable not to modify resection plan in view of retaining the approach for surgery.",
