In December 2019, atypical pneumonia invaded 49 the city of Wuhan, China, and the causative agent of this disease was identified as a new coronavirus that 50 has been subsequently sequenced by five independent laboratories in China (http://www.virological.org).",

Furthermore, they reported that SARS-CoV2 protein S forms trimers with two of the 105 RBD domains: one facing upwards and one facing downwards.

Therefore for scientific research, such as for 163 vaccine development, it is difficult to culture it and a computational framework can provide a better 164 opportunity to explore the dynamics of the infection.165    Two important questions about the disease onset are: 166 1. Infectious Dose: amount of SARS-CoV2 virus, the host is exposed to.167 2. Incubation Period: time taken by the virus to hijack the target cells.168To address the questions one by one, we have run some numerical experiments based on the set of parametric values (source files provided as supplementary material). First, we focused on the infectious dose Shen and Woo (2020), i.e. the amount of virus, the host was exposed to. From the mathematical model presented in section 2, we can see that the density V of SARS-CoV2 depends on the term:c 1 I(t \u2212 \u03c4 2 ) since S are obligate intracellular pathogens ( they can replicate depending on the metabolism of a host 169 cell), c 1 is the parameter that measures the rate at which the infected cells are hijacked by the virus and 170 provide a place to replicate the virus. The density V also depends on the delay caused by the infected 171 cell and virus interaction, represented as \u03c4 2 . The concept of delay in cell interactions and its growth 172 is not new and dates back in 2002, when \"Interaction of the Coronavirus Nucleoprotein with Nucleolar 173 Antigens and the Host Cell\" was reported by Chen et al.
