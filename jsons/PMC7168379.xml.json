This results in educational problems, social isolation, truancy and ultimately early school\u2010leaving and difficulties gaining employment. Although hearing aids and school sound field systems (where an infrared signal transmits the teacher's amplified voice through loudspeakers) are theoretically suitable approaches to this problem, in reality, they are of limited help to infants and young children with draining ears. Indigenous children suffer a mean of 32 months of hearing loss in childhood, compared with 3 months among non\u2010Indigenous children. Among Indigenous children, symptoms of otitis media include otalgia, ear rubbing, fever, excessive crying, restless sleep and poor appetite. Traditionally, management regimens have tended to centre on symptoms and symptom relief. This is compounded by the poor access to health care and socioeconomic standards experienced by many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, and consequently poses a significant impact and burden of disease, not just for this population but for the Australian population in general.",

Although much of this will be covered in other articles in this supplement, in brief, early invasion of the nasopharynx by encapsulated bacteria overwhelms the immature immune system, leading to a failure to elicit an adequate antibody response. Nasopharyngeal carriage, sustained by biofilm formation and intracellular bacterial colonisation, leads to chronic adenoiditis, rhinitis and middle ear infection via the eustachian tube.\n14\n\n\u2010\n\n16\n Social conditions, such as poverty, overcrowding, poor nutrition, exposure to cigarette smoke and lack of running water, all have a role to play in perpetuating the milieu conducive to ongoing carriage of pathogenic bacteria throughout the upper respiratory tract.\n17\n These socioeconomic issues must be addressed, but innovative preventive treatments to diminish bacterial carriage also need to be implemented.",

Among Indigenous children, infection occurs as early as 2 months of age.\n21\n\nOtitis media, in particular middle ear effusion, has a higher incidence among boys; reasons for this are unknown.\n1\n\nIn Australia, Indigenous status significantly increases the risk of middle ear disease in urban, rural and remote locations. This is also the case for other ethnic groups, including Inuit, Native American and Maori children.\n22\n\nIndividual factors such as age, sex and ethnicity may be secondary to eustachian tube size differences.\n23\n\nPremature birth has been variously reported as either having no effect or increasing the risk of otitis media.\n24\n\nThe influence of allergy as a risk factor for otitis media is contentious. An association is noted, with supportive epidemiological and therapeutic evidence in some studies, whereas other studies show no association.\n25\n\n,\n\n26\n\nImmune deficiencies associated with RAOM may include deficiencies in secretory IgA, which is implicated in bacterial and viral adherence and has been shown to reduce bacterial colonisation of the nasopharynx. RAOM that is non\u2010responsive to conventional medical and surgical therapy may reveal low serum IgG2 levels, poor response to Haemophilus influenzae polysaccharide\u2013protein conjugate vaccination and low levels of specific IgG antibodies against pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides 6A and 19F.\n27\n\nGenetic factors may play a part in susceptibility to otitis media. A Norwegian study of 2750 twin pairs concluded that heritability of otitis media susceptibility was 74% among girls and 45% among boys.\n28\n The HLA\u2010A2 gene has been noted to be associated with RAOM but not OME.\n29\n\nOME is over\u2010represented among children with Down syndrome and unrepaired cleft palate and craniofacial disorders. The high incidence of disease is related to the dysfunction of the eustachian tube together with lack of functional resistance to aspiration of nasopharyngeal content.\n30\n\nThe current weight of expert opinion is that the presence of infected adenoids or tissue, with biofilm and intracellular bacteria identified in the tissue, is a greater contributor to AOM and OME than the physical bulk or size of the adenoids. A large Western Australian study of 50 000 children who underwent ventilation tube insertion showed a 50% reduction in subsequent grommet insertion following adenoidectomy.\n31\n\nDespite studies showing pepsinogen carried by gastro\u2010oesophageal reflux into the middle ear fluid in OME and grommet otorrhoea, further definitive studies are required.\n32\n\n,\n\n33\n\n\n",
