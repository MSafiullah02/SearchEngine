We have seen the concept generate substantial political clout, which has led to new public funding. We have seen the concept change over time as different forces have controlled national priorities\u2014the balance has been skewed several times, not so much in the name of research needs or prevention and control priorities, but in the name of funding the home turf. Within this changing scene, how have the zoonoses fared? The answer differs according to whether one comes to the question from the perspective of the animal disease or human disease community (Murphy, 1998, Murphy, 2001).",

Particular zoonotic agents have developed survival strategies to deal with the extremes in host population qualities\u2014of the viruses transmitted from human to human, most thrive in the largest, densest populations or when introduced into an isolated non-immune human population. However, many of the zoonotic infectious agents seem to thrive where there is a minimum density of susceptible animal reservoir hosts, just enough to sustain the transmission chain. Zoonotic transmission chains involving arthropod vectors are subject to very complex, multifactorial, and usually unpredictable patterns. It might seem that such transmission chains are fragile, subject to interruption by minimal human intervention, but in most cases this has not been the case. Mutation and selection work well in the circumstances of \u201cthready\u201d transmission chains: variants with improved \u201cfit\u201d have great survival advantages when added onto ancient transmission and survival patterns.

These population densities present grand opportunities for the selection, penetrance and continued evolution of viral variants. Regardless of the specific mode of transmission, every infectious agent spreads easier when its hosts are closer together. Next most important are the incredible changes occurring in ecosystems themselves, brought about by human occupation of every corner of the planet and the consequent forced adaptation by every other species.

Climate, weather, rainfall, and temperature (global warming) changes can lead to adaptation. Population movements result in the intrusion of humans and domestic animals into previously isolated arthropod habitats such as tropical rainforests. This population movement leads to deforestation and settlement of new tropical forest/farm margins, which may in turn lead to expanding primitive irrigation systems that make no attempt to control mosquito breeding. The opening up of isolated ecosystems such as remote tropical islands, and increased long-distance air travel could introduce populations to new agents and make spreading them easier. Increased long-distance livestock and other animal transportation could carry infectious agents, vectors and even reservoir hosts around the world. New routings of long-distance bird migrations, often caused by new water impoundments, place these birds in contact with new species. In addition to all this, uncontrolled urbanization and environmental pollution favor a great increase in mosquito breeding sites.",

For example, rabies still causes 40,000\u201370,000 human deaths worldwide each year, mostly in Asia and Africa, and 30\u201350% in children. More than 10 million people receive post-exposure treatment each year, and most cases are still caused by the bite of a rabid dog. Even more alarming, most children who die from rabies do not receive post-exposure treatment: a vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin. There is a notorious lack of surveillance data and a notorious failure to use any such data to drive prevention and control programs. On top of this is a failure to deal with the historic belief in several rabies-endemic countries that \u201crabies has always been with us and always will be with us.\u201d For example, after two human rabies deaths in Kerala State, Southern India, in 2006, the respected rabies expert, T. Jacob John, Professor of Clinical Virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, wrote (ProMed 28 April 2006): \u201cThe adage \u2018familiarity breeds contempt\u2019 is apt here. Dogs are common, dog-bites are also common. People often do not take bites seriously. There are several factors involved in such negligent behavior: belief in pre-destiny or fatalism; non-perception of personal risk; lack of authentic information from Public Health agencies; availability of non-scientific remedies; inadequate health education in schools, etc. Needless to say, such tragic deaths are preventable.\u201d Under-estimating the importance of rabies leads decision-makers to perceive rabies as a rare disease, resulting from the bite of an economically unimportant animal (the dog). In many countries, rabies control is lacking and falls in the crack between departments/ministries of health and agriculture because neither takes full responsibility for its prevention.",

This change, that is, the evolutionary progression of infectious agents, especially viruses, is in the nature of the beast.

Zoonotic diseases require substantially different prevention and control strategies than is the case when the etiologic agent has long employed only human-to-human transmission for its survival. Acute infectious disease prevention and control strategies used in public health agencies were largely developed from experiences with the vaccine-preventable childhood diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, hepatitis, etc. With these diseases, traditional, clinically based or laboratory-based surveillance has provided the foundation for intervention activities such as vaccination or antimicrobial chemotherapy. For the zoonoses, prevention and control strategies have come from other amazingly diverse bases. At the heart of these strategies have been individual scientists who have spent whole careers accumulating highly specialized knowledge and experience. In fact, the work of these scientists might best be described as basic research\u2014research that aims to understand the full context, the full ecology of the zoonotic disease of interest, while at the same time seeking the means for its control and prevention. Several National Academies of Sciences/National Research Council reports provide an introduction to this subject (see references).",

            "text": "The zoonoses are likely to become even more important in the future. Strategies for their prevention and control are distinct, often making new research necessary before designing appropriate prevention and control actions. The kind of interdisciplinary research called for often requires specialists who are in short supply. Therefore, long-term planning that takes into consideration the unique nature of zoonoses is needed, and this planning must involve the entire interested scientific community. Planning must not be biased by the most recent or trendy zoonotic disease episode. Because of current interest and perceived problems, the West Nile virus emergence in the northeastern U.S. in 1999 as the ideal model or the more recent cases of human disease caused by H5N1 avian influenza might be taken as an even better basis for developing an overall model. These public health problems are certainly important enough, the impediments realistic enough, the exercise difficult enough, but why not use an even more complex model, one that would test all facets of candidate plans? The ultimate model, the ultimate test of candidate plans may be the zoonosis bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the cause of new-variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease in humans. Today, with the wisdom of hindsight, it might be said that the ministries of agriculture and health in the United Kingdom failed to react in timely fashion and with proper scope and scale of actions to deal with what was clearly a great risk to the public health (and to the livestock economy)\u2014every element of the disease prevention/control responsibilities of both ministries have been called into question. This zoonosis may be instructive in a larger sense also, especially in its easy extension into the worlds of macroeconomics, international trade, and national politics. This zoonosis may be instructive in regard to the take-home message from the 2004 IOM report, Learning from SARS: Preparing for the Next Disease Outbreak (Knobler et al., 2004). This report concludes that if we are to improve the public health response to future outbreaks of infectious diseases, we must:1.Anticipate the emergence of new zoonoses\u2014after all, the most recent episodes of emerging diseases have involved zoonotic agents, so why not anticipate a continuation of this phenomenon?2.Understand that strategies for containing known zoonoses may provide models for containing new ones.3.Improve early detection/diagnostic systems.4.Communicate better with the public.5.Promote applicable research.6.Develop new strategies for containment and decontamination.7.Assure better multinational cooperation and collaboration.\n",
