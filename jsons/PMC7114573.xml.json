In presence of effusion, positive immunofluorescent staining of macrophages is conclusive; however, for the dry form of FIP the definitive diagnosis (based on immunohistochemistry) is not practical if the clinical signs are limited to the CNS.10, 11 Cats with FIP may present some nonspecific hematological abnormalities such as leukocytosis, lymphopenia, nonregenerative anemia, and increased total serum protein caused by hyperglobulinemia (present in about 70% of the cats with the dry form).11 An albumin/globulin ratio of less than 0.6 is diagnostic for an inflammatory process,12 and the most common inflammatory processes are FIP. MRI and computed tomography (CT) of the brain of cats with the neurologic form of FIP often show hydrocephalus, and on MRI, periventricular enhancement and cervical syringohydromyelia have also been reported in cases of suspected CNS FIP (see Fig. 1).13, 14, 15 Spinal fluid analysis often shows high protein content and pleocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils or lymphocytes, but these findings are not pathognomonic for neurologic FIP, and in some cases cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may be normal.6, 7 Serum antibody detection is of limited help because a high percentage of healthy cats have antibodies against feline coronavirus and will never develop FIP; however, very high titers (\u22651:1600) are suggestive of FIP.10 Detection of feline coronavirus in blood by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has a high sensitivity, but low specificity, for clinical disease.10 PCR has accurately differentiated FIP effusions from other types of effusions and can be performed on spinal fluid to diagnose the neurologic form of FIP10; however, the author is not aware of any study reporting the sensitivity and specificity of detection of feline coronavirus in spinal fluid by PCR.",

A definitive diagnosis can be achieved with positive cytology on blood smears in 5% to 13% of the cases,2, 20 bone marrow aspirates in 14% to 67%,2, 22 and spinal fluid analysis in 9% to 35%.2, 20 The variability of positive results in the 3 studies considered is difficult to explain; all 3 studies are retrospective postmortem studies with a similar number of cases,23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 and it is possible that the low number of cases is responsible for the different percentages of in vivo tests with a positive result. Combination of multiple diagnostic tests, such as spinal fluid analysis and bone marrow aspirate, may provide a higher diagnostic yield. However, the diagnostic path most likely to provide a definitive in vivo diagnosis of spinal lymphosarcoma appears to be identification of intra- or extraneural masses by physical examination and diagnostic imaging (thoracic radiographs, abdominal ultrasound, spinal radiographs, and MRI or myelography), and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or biopsy of the mass when possible.2\n",

The incidence of IVDD in cats has been estimated as between 0.02% and 0.12%, whereas in dogs it is estimated at 2%.35 A postmortem study of IVDD in cats performed in 1958 revealed the presence of both Hansen type I (chondroid disc degeneration with annulus fibrosus completely perforated) and type II (fibroid degeneration with bulging annulus fibrosus) disc protrusions.36 King and colleagues36 found dorsal disc protrusions in 1 of every 4 cats obtained at random from local general practices, and severe trauma to the spine was the only exclusion criteria. In the same study, Hansen type I protrusions accounted for only 18% (16/91) of all protrusions; the cervical discs had the most protrusions of both types with a peak at C6-7; another peak of incidence was seen at the L4-5 intervertebral disc space.36 King completed a second postmortem study in 1960, separating type II disc protrusion into small and large. In this study protrusions were more common in the cervical region than in the T10-S1 region; however, if only type I disc protrusions were considered, the cervical and T10-S1 regions had similar incidence (Fig 5\nA).37 If the small type II protrusions were included, the highest incidence of protrusions was found in the C2-3 disc, and in the T10-S1 region, the incidence peak was not at the thoracolumbar junction as in the dog, but at L4-5.37 Disc protrusions were found more frequently in older cats, in particular those older than 15 years.38\n",

Twenty-two cats were DSH, 10 domestic long-haired, 2 domestic medium-haired, and 10 (22%) were pure breed cats. The onset of clinical signs was acute in 13 of 43 cats and insidious with a progressive course in 30 of 43 (70%). Spinal hyperesthesia was reported in 22 of 24 (92%) cats. There were Hansen type I disc protrusions in 30 of 45 (67%) and type II in 15 of 45 cats. The most commonly affected intervertebral discs were L4-5 (9 cats), L7-S1, (7 cats), and T13-L1 (6 cats) (Fig. 5B). Two case series reports focused on lumbar and lumbosacral intervertebral disc disease in cats, and may have skewed the distribution of IVDD toward those locations, however, also in the study by King and Smith37 the L4-5 disc space represented the peak of incidence for IVDD of both type I and type II. The postmortem studies showed a high incidence of cervical disc protrusions, which were less common in clinically affected cats. It has been suggested that the cervical disc protrusions do not cause clinical signs because of the relatively larger size of the cervical vertebral canal.38\n",

            "text": "It is likely that the increased incidence of IVDD at certain locations of the spine is associated with the stance configuration and range of motion of the spine in the cat. A radiographic study of the cat vertebral column showed that during stance, the cat spine exhibits a mild dorsiflexion in the lower lumbar segments, a marked ventroflexion in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar segments, and a severe dorsiflexion in the cranial thoracic (above T9) and cervical segments.55 The same study looked at the mean stance angles relative to the range of motion and found that during stance the lower lumbar joints (L4-5 to L6-7) are nearly maximally dorsiflexed and the joints from T10 to T13 are maximally ventroflexed, while the other joints are held midrange; this may explain the increased prevalence of IVDD at T12-L1 and L4-6 in clinically affected cats (see Fig. 5B).55 In studies of both clinically affected and unaffected cats, IVDD is also found at unusual locations like T2-3 and T3-4 (see Fig. 5). These locations are unusual because discs between T1 and T10 in the dog and T1-T11 in the cats are covered by the intercapital or conjugal ligament, which extends from the head of one rib to the head of the opposite rib over the intervertebral disc and across the floor of the vertebral canal. This ligament is thought to provide additional support to the disc and protection from intervertebral disc protrusions in dogs.37, 56 However, cats owe their flexibility to their vertebral column being able to achieve a total torsion of almost 180\u00b0 and that most of the torsion is seen within a small range of the lower thoracic vertebrae from about T4 to T11.56 Another reason for their flexibility is that the scapulae do not articulate with the axial skeleton, rather, the trunk is supported by muscles (levator scapulae, serratus ventralis, and major and minor rhomboids) that originate on the medial surface of the scapula near the dorsal border and fan out to insert on the trunk in a sling-like arrangement.56 These muscles suspend the trunk from the scapulae much like the wires on a suspension bridge and help to stabilize the trunk against rolling movements.56 The net suspensory force vector between scapula and trunk intersects the vertebral column near the T2-3 joint.56 Therefore, it is possible that the proximity of a very flexible area (T4-11) to a much more stable area (T2-3) of the cat spine may lead to the development of IVDD at those locations, especially during traumatic events; in fact, in 2 cases with T2-3 and T3-4 IVDD an external trauma was documented.1\n",

Sacrocaudal dysgenesis is a constellation of congenital abnormalities commonly reported in Manx and Manx-crossed cats; it may affect the lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal spine, and it is often associated with malformations of the spinal cord such as myelodysplasia, hydromyelia and/or syringomyelia, meningocele or meningomyelocele, and tethered spinal cord.57, 58, 59 Other congenital diseases affecting the spinal cord of cats are cyst-like lesions, such as spinal arachnoid cyst,60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65 spinal intradural epithelial cyst,66 spinal dermoid cyst and sinus,67, 68 or vertebral malformations causing compression of the spinal cord, such as hypoplasia of the odontoid process with secondary atlantoaxial luxation, and multiple cartilaginous exostosis.57\n",

FCE is caused by a small fragment of degenerated disc that occludes the blood supply to the spinal cord, leading to ischemic necrotizing myelopathy.70 The exact pathophysiology of FCE is not known. It has been suggested that herniated nucleus pulposus reaches the spinal cord entering first the vertebral body vasculature, or that the disc extrudes directly within the spinal vasculature or into persistent embryonal arteries of the annulus fibrosus, or anomalous vasculature, or that the disc enters vessels that reach the nucleus pulposus following chronic inflammation.71\n",

The mean and median progression of clinical signs was 19 and 16 hours; however, progression of clinical signs lasted for more than 24 hours in 2 cases and in 1 case there was a recurrence of clinical signs 24 hours after the onset and initial recovery. The most common clinical signs were tetra- or hemiparesis or hemiplegia (9/14), followed by posterior paresis/paraplegia and Horner syndrome, reported in 5 cases each. Spinal tap was performed in 9 cases; in 5 cases spinal fluid analysis revealed neutrophilic pleocytosis, in 2 cases it was normal, in 1 case there was albuminocytological dissociation, and in 1 case blood contamination. Myelography was performed in 3 cases and showed spinal cord swelling in all of these cases. MRI was performed in 9 cases, characterized by intramedullary lesions hypo- or isointense to normal gray matter on T1-weighted images, and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with mild or absent uptake of contrast. MacKay and colleagues76 reported that timing of infarct enhancement is variable; MRI performed within hours from the onset of an infarct may not enhance, whereas 5 to 6 days later the gadolinium enhancement should be more evident. The cervicothoracic intumescence was the spinal cord region with the highest prevalence of suspected or confirmed FCE (50%), followed by the lumbosacral intumescence affected in 21% of the cases; in the dog, a study suggested that the lumbosacral intumescence has the highest incidence of confirmed FCE (47%) followed by the cervicothoracic intumescence with 31%.78 Nine cats were euthanized, and FCE was confirmed by histologic examination of the spinal cord and findings of extensive malacia and intravascular fibrocartilaginous emboli (see Fig. 6B). Three cats made a complete recovery within 2 to 6 weeks and 2 cats showed a significant improvement with only mild conscious proprioceptive deficits within 3 to 7 weeks.71, 74, 77\n",

The high incidence of FCE at the cervicothoracic intumescence is probably explained by the high prevalence of degenerated protruding disc in this region in the cat.36, 37 Also, the cervicothoracic junction is essential for head and neck movements in quadrupedal animals, especially for lowering the head.79 One possible explanation for the marked lateralization of clinical signs may be associated with the arterial supply to the spinal cord of cats and dogs. Approximately half of the central arteries in the feline spinal cord alternate between branching to the right and left side, while the other central arteries have a common stem and supply both sides; the cervical region has a slightly higher frequency of unilateral central arteries (55%) compared with the thoracic (49%) and lumbar spinal cord (47%).80\n",

Myelography, nonselective angiography, and contrast-enhanced CT confirmed an aortocaval fistula and vena caval aneurysm, with an engorged vertebral venous plexus causing a bilateral ventrolateral spinal compression from T12 to L4. An attempt to surgically occlude the anomalous vessel was unsuccessful; on necropsy, the ventral and lateral portions of the spinal cord from T7 to L4 showed Wallerian degeneration, which was more severe from T11 to L1 spinal cord segments. Vascular malformations of the CNS such as the one reported are often developmental anomalies, but they can also be acquired secondary to trauma, rupture of an arterial aneurysm, or surgical ligation of blood vessels.82\n",

All cats were FeLV seropositive for 2 to 4 years, only 4 of 12 cats had the typical hematological abnormalities associated with FeLV infection, such as anemia, macrocytosis, neutropenia, macrothrombocytes, and thrombocytopenia; 10 cats had lymphopenia, and CSF was analyzed in 7 cats and was unremarkable. On histopathology there were widespread lesions in the spinal cord and brainstem characterized by white matter degeneration with dilation of myelin sheaths; some of the dilated myelin sheaths were devoid of axons and others had intact or swollen axons. Positive FeLV p27 immunostaining was present in glial cells, neurons, and endothelial cells of the sections of all spinal cords examined. FeLV proviral DNA was extracted from spinal cord alone in 5 cats and from spinal cord, brain, spleen, and intestine in another 5 cats; CSF was positive only in 1 cat.84\n",

The pathophysiology of vitamin A toxicity is not well understood. It has been hypothesized that vitamin A increases lability of cytomembranes and renders them prone to mechanical injury, leading to the formation of exostosis.92 Vitamin A toxicity causes also an inhibition of the collagen synthesis and breakdown of musculotendinous insertions in the periosteum during muscular activity, therefore in cats the excessive muscular activity during grooming could explain the predisposition of the cervicothoracic spine to be more commonly affected.91 Pain, reduced mobility of the neck, and forelimb lameness due to bony ankylosis and nerve root compression are the early clinical signs of vitamin A toxicity in cats. In some cases the lesions may progress to induce paralysis. Radiographic evidence of vitamin A toxicity may be detected after 15 weeks in kittens on an induction diet.92 It is usual for chronically and severely affected cats to have a poor prognosis for functional recovery, and correction of the diet merely stops progression of the clinical signs; however, in some cases some neurologic deficits seemed to be reversed by correction of the diet.91\n",

In the past this disorder was commonly reported in puppies and kittens fed an all-meat diet.93 A diet low in calcium will especially affect young growing animals that have an increased demand of calcium for bone growth and minimal calcium reserves. In response to a decrease in serum calcium concentration there is an increase in secretion and synthesis of parathyroid hormone, which leads to increased bone resorption, renal calcium reabsorption/phosphorus excretion, and renal synthesis of active vitamin D. The clinical signs will reflect the effects of severe osteopenia and hypocalcemia. In a report of 6 cats with NSH, 2 cats presenting with spinal fractures associated with severe osteopenia were euthanized due to severe neurologic deficits; the other 4 cats improved after a change in diet.93\n",

The most severe lesions affected the center of the dorsal columns of the caudal cervical and cervicothoracic segments with severe loss of fibers, marked astrocytosis, fibrosis, and proliferation of blood vessels. The cat had low serum concentration of cobalamin and folates, and clinical signs consistent with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), confirmed by the histologic examination of the pancreas. Serum cobalamin concentrations are markedly decreased in most cats with exocrine pancreatic disease, because the intrinsic factor, which allows cobalamin absorption in the liver, is produced only by the pancreas in the cat. It is likely that chronic EPI and cobalamin deficiency caused the severe myelopathy in this cat as has been described in humans.85\n",
