            "text": "Animal feeding operations (AFO) generate vast quantities of manure (feces and urine) and wastewater that must be treated, stockpiled, or beneficially used. In the United States there are approximately 238,000 AFO producing an estimated 500 million wet tons of manure annually. Of particular concern is the intensification of animal production, which has led to the creation of concentrated AFO (CAFO) that make up about 15% of all AFO. The major producers of manure are cattle (beef and dairy), poultry (chicken and turkey), and swine operations (Wright et al., 1998). Depending upon the animal production facility, the solid and liquid manures are typically stored in piles or holding ponds, mechanically dewatered, composted, anaerobically digested for biogas production, or a combination of the above. Animal manures applied as solids, semi-solids, and liquids have traditionally been used as soil conditioners and as a source of nutrients for crop production (Power and Dick, 2000; Risse et al., 2006). When improperly managed, however, manures can pollute surface and ground waters with nutrients and pathogenic microorganisms (Ritter, 2000).",

            "text": "Because commercial livestock carry an increased microbial load in their gastrointestinal system, they are often reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens (temporarily or permanently), which can be transmitted to the environment in untreated manures (Gerba and Smith, 2005; Venglovsky et al., 2009). An area of growing interest is airborne pathogens and microbial by-products generated at AFO and during the land application of manures (Chang et al., 2001b; Wilson et al., 2002; Cole et al., 2008; Chinivasagam et al., 2009; Dungan and Leytem, 2009a; Millner, 2009), which can potentially affect the health of livestock, farm workers, and individuals in nearby residences (Heederik et al., 2007). Land application of untreated solid and semi-solid manures and use of pressurized irrigation systems to apply liquid manures and wastewaters increase the chances that microorganisms will become aerosolized (Teltsch et al., 1980a; Brooks et al., 2004; Hardy et al., 2006; Peccia and Paez-Rubio, 2007). Despite the potential for bioaerosol formation during these activities, very few research papers have addressed the risk of human exposure to pathogens during the land application of animal wastes (Boutin et al., 1988; Murayama et al., 2010). To date, much of the research in this area has been conducted with municipal wastewaters (US EPA 1980, 1982; Tanner et al., 2005; Peccia and Paez-Rubio, 2007) and biosolids (Dowd et al., 2000; Brooks et al., 2005a,b; Tanner et al., 2008).",

Tables 1, 2, and 3 present a list of important bacterial, viral, and protozoal zoonotic pathogens associated with animals and their wastes, respectively. Many of these pathogens are endemic in commercial livestock and, therefore, are difficult to eradicate from both the animals and production facilities.

Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (e.g., serovar O157:H7) causes intestinal infections in humans, and complications range from mild diarrhea to severe hemorrhagic colitis or hemolytic-uremic syndrome (Krauss et al., 2003). Salmonella occur in cattle, pigs, poultry, wild birds, pets, rodents, and other animals; however, only nontyphoidal Salmonella (e.g., S. enterica serovar Enteritidis) occurs in both humans and animals. Human infection generally occurs through the ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs or excretions from sick or infected animals, resulting in acute gastroenteritis. Campylobacter jejuni is among the most common causes of diarrheal disease in the United States, and this is attributed to the relatively low infectious dose (<500 organisms). The main reservoirs of C. jejuni are wild birds and poultry, although among farm animals pigs are important carriers. Infection in humans occurs by ingestions of contaminated food (raw or undercooked poultry meat, pork, or milk) or water or by direct contact with contaminated feces.",

Human infections with the FMD virus are rare and infections can usually be traced to direct handling of infected animals or contact during slaughter.

In animals, clinical signs are most commonly observed in newborn calves. Infected animals shed the organism in their feces, and human infection occurs though the ingestion of contaminated food and water. Giardiasis, caused by various Giardia spp. (e.g., G. lamblia), is considered one of the most prevalent parasitic infections in the world, especially in developing nations with poor sanitary practices. Animal hosts of Giardia spp. include cattle, sheep, pigs, cats, rodents, and other mammals, which are direct or indirect sources of human infection. Transmission commonly occurs through the ingestion of food or water contaminated with feces.",

It is well documented that communicable and noncommunicable human diseases are transmitted through airborne routes; however, the airborne transmission of some of the above-mentioned zoonotic pathogens is unknown and quite controversial. Zoonotic pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Hantavirus, are known to be transmitted through aerogenic routes and are capable of causing severe disease in infected individuals (Sobsey et al., 2006). However, some enteric pathogens (e.g., Salmonella spp.) are not typically associated with aerogenic routes of exposure, but based on studies with animals there is evidence suggesting that airborne transmission is possible (Wathes et al., 1988; Harbaugh et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2006). Furthermore, there is much uncertainty associated with the dose-response of airborne pathogens and biological agents because many relationships have not been established to date (Pillai and Ricke, 2002; Douwes et al., 2003; Hermann et al., 2009).",

During spray irrigation events of liquid manures and wastewaters, the water stream is broken up into droplets of various sizes. The size of the droplets is related to the sprinkler head configuration and operating pressure of the irrigation system. Fine droplets, <100 \u03bcm in diameter, evaporate relatively quickly, whereas those >200 \u03bcm do not evaporate appreciably (Hardy et al., 2006). However, the evaporation rate of water droplets increases with decreasing humidity and increasing temperature. In a study conducted with low pressure sprinklers, total evaporation losses ranged from 0.5 to 1.4% for smooth spray plate and 0.4 to 0.6% for coarse serrated sprinklers (Kohl et al., 1987). In a US EPA report (1980), the aerosolization efficiency (E) ranged from 0.08 to 2.7%, with a median value of 0.33% over 17 spray irrigation events using rotating impact-sprinklers. Aerosolization efficiency is the fraction of the total water sprayed that leaves the vicinity of the irrigation system as an aerosol, rather than as droplets.",

Airborne microorganisms and their components are generated as a mixture of droplets or particles, having different aerodynamic diameters ranging from 0.5 to 100 \u03bcm (Lighthart, 1994; Cox and Wathes, 1995). The generation of bioaerosols from water sources occurs during bubble bursting or splash, and wave action and microorganisms (single cells or groups) are usually surrounded by a thin layer of water (Stetzenbach, 2007). Aside from natural activities, land spreading of slurries, pressurized spray irrigation events, and aeration basins at wastewater treatment plants are a few ways microorganisms become aerosolized. Bioaerosols generated directly from relatively dry surfaces (e.g., feedlots, soils, plants) or during the land application of dry manures can be released as individual or groups of cells or associated with inorganic or organic particulate matter (Cambra-L\u00f3pez et al., 2010).

The most significant factors that affect viability are relative humidity, temperature, and solar irradiance (Table 4). In general, laboratory and field studies have shown that microorganism viability decreases with decreases in relative humidity and increases in temperature and solar irradiance (Poon, 1966; Dimmock, 1967; Ehrlich et al., 1970b; Goff et al., 1973; Marthi et al., 1990; Theunissen et al., 1993; Lighthart and Shaffer, 1994). As relative humidity decreases, there is less water available to the microorganisms, which causes dehydration and subsequent inactivation of many microorganisms. However, because temperature influences relative humidity, it is often difficult to separate their effects (Mohr, 2007). Targets of relative humidity- and temperature-induced inactivation of airborne microorganisms appear to be proteins and membrane phospholipids (Cox and Wathes, 1995).

Because bacteria are much more complex, biochemically and structurally, than viruses, viruses tend to be more resistant to the effects of oxygen and temperature-induced inactivation, except in the case of spore-forming bacteria such as Clostridium spp. (Mohr, 2007). Inactivation of bioaerosols by solar irradiance is highly dependent upon wavelength and is exacerbated by dehydration and oxygen (Beebe, 1959; Riley and Kaufman, 1972; Cox and Wathes, 1995; Ko et al., 2000). Short-wavelength ionizing radiation (e.g., x-rays, gamma rays, UV) induces free-radical-mediated reactions that cause damage to biopolymers, such as nucleic acids and proteins. Another factor, known as the open-air factor, is based on the fact that the survival of many outdoor airborne microorganisms is generally poorer than in inside air under similar conditions (Cox and Wathes, 1995). This effect was attributed to ozone-olefin reaction products in the outdoors. Whereas the above-mentioned factors influence viability, microbial factors such as the type, genus, species, and strain of an organism also affect its airborne survival (Songer, 1967; Ehrlich et al., 1970b).",

            "text": "Microorganisms associated with droplets that evaporate to dryness or near-dryness before impacting the ground or vegetation are transported in air currents. When bioaerosols are released from a source, they can be transported short or long distances and are eventually deposited in terrestrial and aquatic environments (Brown and Hovm\u00f8ller, 2002; Jones and Harrison, 2004; Griffin, 2007). The transport, behavior, and deposition of bioaerosols are affected by their physical properties (i.e., size, shape, and density) and meteorological factors they encounter while airborne. Because most bioaerosols are not perfectly spherical, the most useful size definition is aerodynamic diameter, which is the major factor controlling their airborne behavior (Kowalski, 2006). Aerodynamic diameter is defined as the diameter of a spherical particle of water (a unit density sphere) with which a bioaerosol or microorganism has the same settling velocity in air. Meteorological factors such as wind velocity, relative humidity, temperature, and precipitation affect the transport of bioaerosols, with atmospheric stability being a major factor (Lighthart and Mohr, 1987; Lighthart, 2000; Jones and Harrison, 2004). Relative humidity not only affects microorganism viability as discussed above, but also affects settling velocity because it directly influences the density and aerodynamic diameter of the bioaerosol unit (Ko et al., 2000; Mohr, 2007). The deposition of bioaerosols occurs through gravitational settling, impaction, diffusion onto surfaces, and wash-out by raindrops (Muilenberg, 1995). For particles with an aerodynamic diameter >5 \u03bcm, gravitational settling and impaction are the leading causes of particle loss during transport (Mohr, 2007). For larger airborne particles (>25 \u03bcm), removal by raindrops is quite efficient.",

In brief, the aerosol samplers are usually set at 1.5 m above the ground, which corresponds to the average breathing height for humans. Air is then pulled through the samplers at a specified flow rate (e.g., 12.5 L\u00b7min\u22121 for glass impingers) for several minutes to hours using a vacuum pump. Samples are then analyzed via culture-dependent or molecular-based (e.g., PCR) assays or microscopically to calculate a microorganism concentration per cubic meter of air. In the case of airborne endotoxins, samples are typically collected on filters, subsequently extracted using a weak Tween solution, and analyzed using the kinetic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Schulze et al., 2006; Dungan and Leytem, 2009c).

In a study at a swine operation, the average bacterial concentrations within the barns were 1.8 \u00d7 104 cfu\u00b7m\u22123, and although the outside air concentration decreased with distance from the facility, at 150 m downwind the bacterial concentration was still 2.5-fold greater (208 cfu\u00b7m\u22123) than at the upwind location (Green et al., 2006). In a recent study by Matkovi\u0107 et al. (2009), airborne concentrations of fungi inside a dairy barn were about 6 \u00d7 104 cfu\u00b7m\u22123 throughout the day (morning, noon, and night) and downwind concentrations approached background levels (2.0 to 6.2 \u00d7 103 cfu\u00b7m\u22123) at distances as close as 5 to 50 m from the barn. At an open-lot dairy, the average endotoxin concentration at a background site was 24 endotoxin units (EU)\u00b7m\u22123, whereas at the edge of the lot and 200 and 1,390 m further downwind, the average concentrations were 338, 168, and 49 EU\u00b7m\u22123, respectively (Dungan and Leytem, 2009a).

(1988) investigated bioaerosol emissions associated with the land application of swine and cattle slurries by way of tractor-pulled tanker and fixed high-pressure spray guns. Near the source, total bacterial counts were about 2,000 cfu\u00b7m\u22123, regardless of the land application method. The bacterial counts steadily decreased with distance from the application site and pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were not detected. However, compared with tank spreading, which sprays closer to the ground, airborne bacterial concentrations were greater at greater distances from the spray guns, which is likely related to the upward discharge of slurry into the air that enhances droplet size reduction and drift. To our knowledge, the Boutin et al. (1988) study is the only peer-reviewed report that addresses bioaerosol transport during spray irrigation of livestock manures, whereas most other reports address spray irrigation of industrial and municipal wastes (Katzenelson and Teltch, 1976; Parker et al., 1977; Camann et al., 1988; Brooks et al., 2005a; Tanner et al., 2005). In a preliminary pilot-scale field study conducted by Kim et al. (2007), swine manure was land-applied through a center pivot irrigation system and bioaerosol samples were collected upwind and 8, 14, and 23 m downwind. Total airborne coliform concentrations were found to decrease with distance, from about 108 most probable number (MPN)\u00b7m\u22123 at 8 m to near background concentrations at 106 MPN\u00b7m\u22123 at 23 m downwind.",

            "text": "Although the focus of this review is on bioaerosols associated with animal operations and manures, one could reasonably expect microorganisms in industrial and municipal wastewaters to behave similarly once aerosolized. Differences in survivability may occur though, depending upon the concentration and type of OM in the wastes because some organic substances are known to act as osmoprotectants (Cox, 1966; Marthi and Lighthart, 1990) and may provide some degree of physical protection against UV radiation and drying (Sobsey and Meschke, 2003; Aller et al., 2005). Parker et al. (1977) investigated the transport of aerosolized bacteria during the spray irrigation of potato processing wastewater. As with other similar studies, there was a decrease in the airborne microorganism concentration with distance from the irrigation system. These authors reported detection of coliforms at distances as far as 1.0 to 1.5 km from the source; however, there was no way to verify if they were above background concentrations because that information was not provided in the report. During the land application of liquid and dewatered domestic sewage sludge (biosolids) via spray tanker and spreader/slinger, respectively, indicator organisms (coliforms, Clostridium perfringens, E. coli) were not detected at distances greater than 30 m (Brooks et al., 2005b). In most of the above-mentioned bioaerosol transport studies, fecal contamination indicator organisms were targeted. Fecal indicator organisms are generally chosen because they are more abundant and easily identified in the aerosols (Teltsch and Katzenelson, 1978; Bausum et al., 1982; Brenner et al., 1988), although they may behave differently from pathogens (Dowd et al., 1997; Carducci et al., 1999). Alternatively, to improve upon estimates of off-site transport of bioaerosols, some researchers have used molecular-based approaches to track microorganisms from swine houses (Duan et al., 2009) or during the land application of class B biosolids (Low et al., 2007) and domestic wastewater (Paez-Rubio et al., 2005). This approach is called microbial source tracking and has only recently been applied to aerosol samples.",

Emission rate is a useful variable for understanding the impact of waste application, and similarities between application of municipal and livestock wastes can be made because the same spreading equipment is often used. During the land application of dewatered biosolids using a slinger, average emission rates for total bacteria, heterotrophic bacteria, total coliforms, sulfite-reducing clostridia, and endotoxin were reported to be 2.0 \u00d7 109 cfu\u00b7s\u22121, 9.0 \u00d7 107 cfu\u00b7s\u22121, 4.9 \u00d7 103 cfu\u00b7s\u22121, 6.8 \u00d7 103 cfu\u00b7s\u22121, and 2.1 \u00d7 104 EU\u00b7s\u22121, respectively (Paez-Rubio et al., 2007). In a study conducted by Tanner et al. (2005), ground water seeded with E. coli was sprayed using a spray-tanker, and emission rates were reported to range from 2.0 to 3.9 \u00d7 103 cfu\u00b7s\u22121. Interestingly, when studies were conducted using liquid biosolids, neither coliform bacteria nor coliphage were detected in air 2 m downwind, although these microorganisms were detected in the biosolids. Although no reason was given for the latter outcome, the direct measurement of bioaerosols does provide necessary information required for calculating emission rates. A bioaerosol emission rate is a required input variable for all aerosol fate and transport models that predict absolute concentration at a specified distance from the source (Paez-Rubio et al., 2007).",

In an effort to assess the transport and diffusion of airborne microorganisms associated with human and livestock diseases, dispersion modeling has been utilized (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2001; Garten et al., 2003; Pedersen and Hansen, 2008). In Australia, atmospheric dispersion models have been developed as part of preparedness programs to manage potential outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (Cannon and Garner, 1999; Garner et al., 2006). In early bioaerosol transport studies, models were based upon a modified version of the inert particle dispersion model developed by Pasquill (1961). Although some of the inert particle model assumptions will not be met at a typical AFO, the model assumes 1) Gaussian distribution of particles in the crosswind and vertical planes; 2) particles are emitted at a constant rate; 3) diffusion in the direction of transport is negligible; 4) particles are <20 \u03bcm in diameter (i.e., gravitational effects are negligible); 5) particles are reflected from the ground (i.e., no deposition or reactions at surface); 6) wind velocity and direction are constant; and 7) terrain is flat.

The microbial death and inactivation rates are generally derived from empirical laboratory data under static atmospheric conditions using pure cultures (Hatch and Dimmick, 1966). Therefore, it is imperative when developing microbial death rates to conduct the experiments with numerous microbial types and under varying environmental conditions (Peterson and Lighthart, 1977). In laboratory studies, microbial death rates for Sarcina lutea at 15\u00b0C were 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22122 and 5.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22121 at around 2 and 90% relative humidity, whereas death rates for Pasturella tularensis at 27\u00b0C were 7.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 and 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121 at similar relative humidities, respectively (Cox and Goldberg, 1972; Lighthart, 1973). Whereas these microbes are non-spore formers, one would expect spore-forming bacteria to survive longer under changing atmospheric conditions as a result of their ability to tolerate greater temperature and radiation (Madigan and Martinko, 2006). As mentioned previously, the viability of airborne microorganisms will vary greatly depending upon growth media used and microbial genus and species being tested. In field trials conducted at Pleasanton, CA, microbial death rates during the spray irrigation of municipal wastewater were determined under a variety of environmental conditions (US EPA, 1980). The median death rate constants for total coliform, fecal coliform, and coliphage were 3.2, 2.3, and 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 s\u22121, respectively. Death rate constants for E. coli, prepared in sterilized municipal wastewater, were reported to range from 8.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121 in the morning to 6.6 \u00d7 10\u22122 s\u22121 in the afternoon (Teltsch et al., 1980b).",

(1977) modified Pasquill's inert particle dispersion model to predict the transport of bioaerosols from an area source (i.e., sprinkler irrigation of potato processing wastewater). Even though the model contained a biological decay term, the authors did not model decay or loss of viability of microorganisms due to a lack of experimental data. Dowd et al. (2000) later used the same area-source model with microbial death rates from the literature to predict bioaerosol transport during the land application of dewatered domestic sewage sludge (biosolids). Based upon model predictions at a high wind speed of 10 m\u00b7s\u22121, bacterial concentrations would be 69 and 6.5 m\u22123 of air at 100 and 10,000 m, respectively. To assess the risk of infection to workers and nearby populations, a Beta-Poisson model as described by Haas (1983) was utilized. Using dose-response data for SalmonellaTyphimurium, the predicted risk of infection at 100 m with a 10 m\u00b7s\u22121 wind speed and 8 h exposure period was 13%, whereas at 1,000 and 10,000 m it decreased to 8.7 and 1.6%, respectively. Risk of infection for Coxsackievirus B3 was also determined; however, an incorrect dose-response value was used in the single-hit exponential model, and predicted risk of infection should have actually been about 3 orders of magnitude less than their published values. Overall, their model predictions suggest that bioaerosols from land-applied biosolids can increase the risk of viral and bacterial infection to onsite workers, but there was little or no risk to population centers >10 km from the application site under low-wind conditions (\u22645 m\u00b7s\u22121). The results from such studies should be used cautiously because the results were not empirically derived and, as outlined by Pillai and Ricke (2002), there is uncertainty associated with the dose-response of different organisms and hosts.",

The droplet dispersion model was separated into 5 submodels: 1) aerosol generation, 2) evaporation, 3) dispersion, 4) deposition, and 5) microbial death. The position of each droplet, at each time step in the trajectory, was located in a 3-dimensional coordinate system. When the modeling process was repeated for many droplets, a simulation of a cloud of droplets then occurred. The effect of evaporation was determined to be an important factor when simulated in the model, as aerosols were carried further downwind. Whereas the model takes into account the physical, chemical, and measured meteorological parameters for each water droplet, potential shortcomings revolved around the ability of the model to predict near-source survival dynamics of airborne microorganisms (e.g., effect of microorganisms on water evaporation, critical water content of microbes). Also, the droplet dispersion model does not take into account rapidly changing wind conditions (e.g., gusts) and, therefore, use of average wind velocities will lead to an oversimplification of meteorological conditions and microbial dispersion. When the model was compared with a release of Pseudomonas syringae, deposition rates were found to be similar within 30 m of the source. The simulation model was later used by Ganio et al. (1995) to model a field spray event of Bacillus subtilis var. niger spores. Using the same meteorological conditions as the spray event, the model produced a bioaerosol deposition pattern somewhat similar to that obtained in the field (r2 = 0.66).",

Using the same virus emission data, the models produced very similar 24 h integrated concentrations along the major axis of the plume at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 km. Although there were differences between the estimates, as a result of model assumptions with respect to upward diffusion rates for surface material and choice of input weather data, most estimates were within one order of magnitude. These models also predicted similar directions for livestock at risk; however, additional model assumptions such as microbial fate and susceptibility to airborne infection can substantially modify the size and location of the downwind risk area.",

Exposure to airborne bacteria, virus, fungi, and microbial by-products is not limited to inhalation routes because deposition on fomites, food crops, and water bodies and subsequent ingestion also represent transmission routes of concern. The ability to accurately quantify airborne microorganisms within and downwind from a source is important when evaluating health risks to exposed humans and animals.

As molecular-based approaches improve with respect to sensitivity and rapidity, it may be appropriate to standardize and use such technologies to directly detect pathogens of interest in aerosol samples, avoiding the need for indicator organisms. Standardization of target microorganisms and collection and analytical methodologies will improve the ability of researchers to compare results, refine dispersion models, and develop unified risk estimates.",
