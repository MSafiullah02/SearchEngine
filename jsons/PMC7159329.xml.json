At least four major HEV genotypes have been identified, which have different geographical distributions and host ranges [Xing et al., 2011]. Despite classification into four geographically distinct genotypes, the HEV strains antigenically belong to a single serotype and share cross\u2010reacting epitopes due to the high degree of sequence conservation [Wang and Zhuang, 2004; Xing et al., 2011]. Genotype 1 includes most of human HEV strains which is endemic in Asia and North Africa, genotype 2 is identified in human and includes the Mexican strain and few strains of African countries. Genotypes 3 and 4 have been identified in pigs and other animals; however, humans can be infected with these two genotypes too. Genotype 3 predominates in industrialized countries, and genotype 4 is endemic in Asia, particularly China, Taiwan, and Japan [Emerson and Purcell, 2001; Yamashita et al., 2009].",

However, sporadic and epidemic outbreaks of the acute hepatitis usually lead to a self\u2010limited disease, but the infection is potentially fatal and causes fulminant hepatitis in susceptible individuals such as pregnant women and patients with underlying liver disease [Zhu et al., 2010; Xing et al., 2011], and has high mortality rate of up to 30% among pregnant women [Xing et al., 2011]. Therefore HEV is a significant public health problem worldwide especially in endemic areas and primary prevention of the HEV infection seems essential.",

Development of an effective vaccine, which can significantly reduce the prevalence of this disease, is a desirable goal. Killed and live attenuated vaccines are not available due to the lack of a permissive cell culture system for HEV replication [Emerson and Purcell, 2001]. Therefore the main focus for vaccine design is on molecular approaches, especially expression of viral proteins in different expression systems [Emerson and Purcell, 2001; Jimenez de Oya et al., 2012].",

ORF2, which encodes capsid protein, is highly conserved and immunogenic among HEV species [Emerson and Purcell, 2001]. Due to hydrophobicity and insolubility of full\u2010length capsid protein (72 kDa) [Tsarev et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 2001], new generation vaccines such as multiepitope vaccines are of particular interest. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to design a high density multiepitope protein compromising four HTL epitopes with high\u2010affinity binding to the HLA molecules using the in silico analysis, and to evaluate the immunological properties of this protein in vitro. Overall, this study represents a novel strategy for the development of HEV vaccines in the future.",

            "text": "The amino acid sequences of the ORF2 from Standard strains of HEV genotype 1 including Pakistan/Sar\u201055 strain (accession number P33426), China strain (accession number Q81871), Burma strain (accession number P29326), Myanmar strain (accession number Q04611) and India strain (accession number Q68985) were obtained from Uniprot Knowledgebase (http://www.uniprot.org/). The sequences were aligned by MEGA software version 4.0 (Biodesign Institute, Tempe, AZ) [Tamura et al., 2007], and then the conserved sequences among these Strandard strains were determined. The highly conserved HEV\u2010derived HLA\u2010DR\u2010restricted HTL epitopes of these strains were predicted by SYFPEITHI online software (http://www.syfpeithi.de/home.htm). HLA\u2010DR binding affinity of the predicted epitopes was determined by IEDB Analysis Resource online program (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/analyze/html/mhc_II_binding.html). Genetic diversity of MHC molecules is very high in human population; therefore HTL epitopes with high population coverage are needed for this study. Four epitopes with high\u2010affinity to the most common HLA\u2010DR alleles in Iran and world population were selected. Therefore it is predicted that this construct could cover the most world population. The four HTL epitopes (15 amino acids) derived from HEV capsid protein including HLA\u2010DRB1*1501 (A150\u2013164), HLA\u2010DRB1*0701 (B320\u2013334), HLA\u2010DRB1*1101 (C370\u2013384), HLA\u2010DRB1*0401 and HLA\u2010DRB3*0101 (DR52) (D491\u2013505)\u2010restricted epitopes were binded to each other as a linear multiepitope (ABCD). To avoid creation of junctional epitopes, the construct was designed with amino acid spacer sequences (Gly\u2013Pro\u2013Gly\u2013Pro\u2013Gly) between sequential HTL epitopes [Livingston et al., 2002; Depla et al., 2008]. The four times repeated multiepitope was constructed as high density multiepitope (Fig. 1A). Based on E. coli codon usage, the nucleotide sequence of the high density multiepitope gene was optimized using GenScript Rare Codon Analysis Tool (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) for efficient expression. In order to simplify the purification of the target protein, a sequence encoding 8\u2010His tag was added at the C\u2010terminal of the optimized gene followed by adding two stop codons (TAA and TAG) to terminate protein synthesis. Two restriction\u2010enzyme digestion sites, NdeI and XhoI, were placed in the both ends of the codon\u2010optimized gene to subclone it into the pET30a (+) vector.",

It has been shown that HEV capsid protein has several immunogenic epitopes [Gu et al., 2004].

Oany et al. designed a multiepitope vaccine candidate compromising B cell and T cell epitopes from spike protein of human coronavirus by in silico analysis.

Meanwhile, some disadvantages like the creation of junctional epitopes in the sequential arrangement of the epitopes have limited using these constructs [Livingston et al., 2002; Depla et al., 2008]. Junctional epitopes is created by the juxtaposition of two epitopes, and can suppress the immune responses to the main epitopes [Livingston et al., 2002]. This problem was overcome through application of the spacer residues between the epitopes to improve appropriate epitope processing. Furthermore, it has been reported that if the epitope is expressed with high density will enhance protective immunity [Liu et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2008]. Lu et al. designed constructs consisting of various V3 epitope densities from HIV\u20101 gp120, and found that high epitope density in one single protein molecule could enhance protective immunity [Lu et al., 2008].

It has been shown that during acute infection, virus\u2010specific T helper cell responses can clear viral infection but lack of its activity leads to chronic infection [MacDonald et al., 2002]. In this study, the HLA typing was not carried out and the frequencies of various HLA alleles among the participants were not determined.

Fast cultivation, well\u2010known genetics and high\u2010level expression capabilities with high purity are some other advantages of E. coli expression system [Fakruddin et al., 2013]. Despite all these advantages, expression of a foreign gene in E. coli may be hampered by the presence of rare codons and high GC contents within the gene\u2010coding region which result in decrease of the expression level or production of insoluble and nonfunctional proteins [Mondal et al., 2013; Elena et al., 2014].

The target genes were cloned in to the pET30a+ plasmid and expressed by IPTG\u2010induction under control of strong bacteriophage T7 promoter and T7 RNA polymerase of the E. coli BL21 cell. The IPTG\u2010induction is economically desirable method and increases protein production [Mondal et al., 2013].
