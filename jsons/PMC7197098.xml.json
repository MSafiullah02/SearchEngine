            "text": "Cell signaling is accomplished via networks of transcriptional changes that lead to synthesis of distinct sets of proteins, which cause changes in growth, development, or metabolism. Treatments that elevate levels of hormones result in cascades of changes in gene expression driven by activation and synthesis of transcription factors which are required to turn on downstream genes. One approach to model these gene regulatory networks is to collect measurements of changes in abundance of gene transcripts across a time course. The expression of a gene encoding a transcriptional activator or repressor protein may signal to the next gene to either turn on or turn off downstream genes and their encoded proteins. Thus, time course transcriptomic data sets contain important information about how genes drive these changes in biological networks. Yet genome-wide transcript abundance assays examine tens of thousands of genes so identification of patterns or networks within these large data sets is difficult. It is also critical to filter the meaningful transcript changes in these data sets to remove genes whose responses are not above background or that are dissimilar due to biological or technical variation. Yet even though the bioinformatics community has developed statistical methods to filter the data [9], additional approaches are needed to identify the networks and patterns in these large data sets.",

Here, we extend our previous work on this problem by incorporating time series adjustments in the computation of Bayesian likelihoods. We apply this method to time course data generated in response to treatments that elevate the levels of the hormone ethylene in Arabidopsis thaliana. We take advantage of a previously published genome-wide transcriptional data set [9], subjected to rigorous filtering and from which all the genes predicted to encode transcription factors have been identified. The goal is to predict gene regulatory networks that control time-matched developmental changes.",

Rather, the method constructs a model over all of the data that uses each replicate as a source of information. The assumption is that at each level of the hierarchy there are commonalities in the data and parameters. Thus, the replicate data is not independent. Second, the addition of time series adjustment to improve the independence of the model\u2019s residuals gives these techniques stronger statistical foundations. Third, the combination of Bayesian model averaging with a cutting edge genetic algorithm provides rigorous estimates of posterior probabilities for edges. These computational modeling algorithms are derived using rigorous mathematical and statistical techniques and are computationally efficient. The models produced are easily understandable.",

Our technique in this paper is a Bayesian regression type method. Variations of Bayesian modeling can be found in [7, 11, 19]. Other methods that use types of regression include [2, 21] which focus on logistic regression techniques, and [22, 23] which use Poisson regression. Other approaches to modeling these types of problems include differential equations [1] and Boolean modeling [14].",

This is usually due to the remaining influence of the previous time\u2019s response data. In complicated modeling situations (e.g., like ours where we need to obtain closed form likelihoods of DAGs within a hierarchical structure in order to produce posterior probabilities of edges), it is common to derive results as if there were non-correlated residuals, as we have done in previous work. Our previous work has shown utility both for simulated and biological data, but we now rigorously incorporate a time series adjustment into our model. This should result in substantially less correlated residuals and thus more accurate likelihoods for the DAGs. Since these likelihoods are the foundations for the edges\u2019 estimated posterior probabilities, these estimates should also be improved.",
