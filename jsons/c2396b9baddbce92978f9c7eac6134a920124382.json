Within the quadriceps muscle group there was a main effect of muscle on anterior-posterior centre of gravity (p = 0.010), but the magnitude of the difference was very small. Within the quadriceps there was a main effect of muscle on medial-lateral hotspot (p = 0.027) and map volume (p = 0.047), but no post-hoc tests were significant. The topography of each lower-limb muscle was complex, displaying multiple peaks that were present across the stimulation grid, and variable across individuals. The results of this study indicate that TMS delivered with a 110-mm double-cone coil could not reliably identify discrete cortical representations of resting lower-limb muscles when responses were measured using bipolar surface electromyography. The characteristics of the cortical representation of lower-limb muscles reported here provide a basis against which to evaluate cortical reorganisation in clinical populations.",

Only one study has quantified the representation of multiple lower-limb muscles in the same individuals. In statistical analysis, there was no main effect of muscle, suggesting similar cortical representation of the active rectus femoris and vastii muscles (Te et al. 2017) . However, the separation between the representation of the three muscles was smaller in individuals with patellofemoral pain than in healthy controls, suggesting that separation between muscles might be a measure of interest (Te et al. 2017) . This supports findings in other chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions, where there was reduced distinction in the cortical representation of two back muscles in individuals with low-back pain (Tsao et al. 2011b) , and of two forearm extensor muscles in individuals with elbow pain (Schabrun et al. 2015) . The extent to which TMS can be used to identify discrete cortical representation of lower-limb muscles therefore warrants further investigation. In addition, recent studies have identified multiple discrete peaks in the cortical representation of a muscle (Schabrun et al. 2015; Te et al. 2017 ), but no normative data exists on this measure for the representation of lower-limb muscles.",

For each participant, a stimulus intensity was selected that elicited consistent MEPs in all muscles, but that would be tolerable for the remainder of the experiment. In two participants (one woman, one man) it was not possible to elicit MEPs on resting muscles with a tolerable stimulus intensity, and these participants did not participate further. In the remaining 16 participants, the mean (SD) selected stimulation intensity was 52 (9.3)% maximum stimulator output (range, 38-65% maximum stimulator output).",

The front-rightmost corner of the grid was positioned 1 cm to the right and 5 cm anterior to the vertex, and the back-leftmost corner was 5 cm to the left and 3 cm posterior to the vertex (Figure 1 ). This resulted in a total of 63 grid sites. The target grid was centred slightly anterior to the vertex based on previous reports that the CoG of lower-limb muscles is anterior to the vertex (Schwenkreis et al. 2003; Al Sawah et al. 2014; Ward et al. 2016b Ward et al. , 2016a Te et al. 2017 ). The target grid was designed to cover a large area to capture the boundaries of the cortical representations. The order of the targets was randomised and each target was stimulated once at the predetermined stimulus intensity. The inter-stimulus interval was at least 5 s. A break of ~5 min was then taken, before this was repeated. The purpose of this break was to avoid long blocks of stimuli during which the participant's attention or level of arousal might decline. Five sets of stimuli were performed in total. At each target, the experimenter viewed real-time information on the position of the coil and the error from the target position and did not stimulate until there was <2 mm error in coil position. The position of the coil was recorded for each stimulation. The same experimenter (JD) performed TMS for all participants.",

There was a statistically significant different in CoG AP and hotspot ML across the quadriceps muscles but the effect size and magnitude of differences was very small. The magnitude of the difference means that it would not be practically possible to differentially target one of the three quadriceps muscles with navigated TMS. These results indicate that there was considerable overlap in the cortical representations of the lower limb muscles identified by TMS and surface EMG, and that TMS delivered with a double-cone coil could not identify discrete cortical representations of lower-limb muscles when MEPs were measured with bipolar surface EMG.",

However, this improved stimulation depth is obtained at the expense of focality (Lu and Ueno 2017) . The large area of cortical tissue activated by TMS delivered through a double-cone coil means that even when the coil is not centred over the motor cortex, excited tissue will likely include the motor cortex. This could explain the apparent expansion of the cortical representation beyond the borders of the target grid, and the larger area of the cortical representation than previously reported (Schwenkreis et al. 2003; Al Sawah et al. 2014; Ward et al. 2016b Ward et al. , 2016a Te et al. 2017) . Nonetheless, if current spread was the only relevant factor, the largest MEP may still be expected when the stimulating coil was centred over the motor cortex.

            "text": "In some muscles in some participants, there was a second MEP that occurred with a latency of 60-70 ms. This late MEP has previously been reported in the resting hamstrings, quadriceps, tibialis anterior and triceps surae muscles, with a latency of 59 ms, 64 ms, 79 ms and 72 ms, respectively (Dimitrijevi\u0107 et al. 1992) , and in resting and active tibialis anterior and triceps surae muscles with a latency of ~100 ms (Holmgren et al. 1990 ). Dimitrijevic et al. reported that this late MEP was most prevalent in the hamstrings, where it was of higher amplitude than the primary MEP. This is in line with the current findings, where the late MEP was observed most frequently and with the largest amplitude in the hamstring muscles. The late MEP is not exclusive to the lower limbs, and has been observed in resting and active forearm muscles (Holmgren et al. 1990 ) and a resting, but not active, intrinsic hand muscle (Wilson et al. 1995 ).",

Based on the latency of responses from several lower-limb muscles, Dimitrijevic et al. argued against a segmental or transcortical stretch reflex origin of the late MEP, and against the involvement of gamma motor neurones (Dimitrijevi\u0107 et al. 1992) . The difference in the latency of the late MEP between upper-and lower-limb muscles is ~5 ms greater than the difference in latency of the early, primary MEP (Holmgren et al. 1990 ), lending the possibility that a slow central pathway is involved. Recent evidence indicates the primary motor cortex includes slow pyramidal tract neurones (Innocenti et al. 2019) , which comprise the majority of the pyramidal tract but are not well studied (Firmin et al. 2014; Kraskov et al. 2018) . This may provide one such candidate pathway, but this remains to be studied.",

For example, requiring the participant to perform an isometric contraction of the quadriceps would increase excitability of the cortical areas involved in generating this type of contraction. The cortical representation of the quadriceps revealed by TMS will reflect this, and may fail to include the cortical representation relevant for a dynamic movement such as gait. For this reason, I chose to study resting muscles in the present study.Ward et al. (Ward et al. 2016b, 2016a andTe et al. (Te et al. 2017) studied muscles performing a low-intensity isometric contraction, and this may have contributed to the more focussed topographical maps in these previous studies.By contrast, Schwenkreis et al.(Schwenkreis et al. 2003) and AlSawah et al. (Al Sawah et al. 2014) studied resting muscles. The topographical maps are not described in detail, but Schwenkreis et al. report that, across six healthy subjects, they observed an MEP in the resting quadriceps muscle response to stimulation at, on average, ~15 sites (cf map area results)(Schwenkreis et al. 2003). Similarly, Al Sawah observed an MEP in the resting vastus lateralis muscle in response to stimulation at, on average, ~8 sites (n = 10 healthy participants, cf map area results) (AlSawah et al. 2014).
