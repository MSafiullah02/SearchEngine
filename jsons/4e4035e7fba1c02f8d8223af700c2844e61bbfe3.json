It is the first compartmental model; the population is divided into different compartments or classes: susceptibles (individuals which are susceptible to the disease), infected (individuals which have been infected by the disease and are infectious) and recovered (individuals which are removed from infected compartment). Consequently, it is a SIR model where susceptible individuals are infected and the individuals leaving the infective compartment become immune, dead or removed by an isolation policy.",

The state of each cell is updated in discrete time steps according to a local transition function which depends on the states of the cells in some neighborhood around it. As the lattice is finite, some type of boundary conditions must be imposed. As is mentioned above, the usual topologies of CAs are chains and regular lattices; nevertheless, particular properties of two-dimensional lattice space exhibit some drawbacks: connection topology among the cells is restricted to predetermined homogeneous lattice, etc. As a consequence, although that is the standard paradigm for cellular automata, other topologies must be considered when the phenomenon to simulate therefore requires it. In this sense the topologies based on graphs are very important and useful: the nodes of the graph stand for the cells of the CA, and the neighborhood of a particular cell/node is constituted by the nodes adjacent to that one.",

Of special interest are the CA-epidemic proposals modeling the motion of individuals (see, for example [2, 4, 14] ).
