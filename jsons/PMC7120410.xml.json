If we consider every element as panel point, the relationship of the elements as the connection, then the system will be a network [1], for example the nervous system can be regarded as network interconnected by lots of nerve cells through nerve fibers. The computer network can be regarded as a network connected by computer through communication medium such as optical cable, twisted-pair, and coaxial-cable. Besides the power grid, social networking and transportation network, and so on are of the same kind [2]. Emphasis on the structure of the system and the system analysis from structure are the research thinking of the complex network. The difference is that the property of the topological structure of the abstracted real networks is different from the network discussed before, and has numerous nodes, as a result we call it complex network [3]. In recent years, a large number of articles are published in world leading publication such as Science, Nature, PRL, and PNAS, which reflects indirectly that complex network has been a new research hot spot.",

So the regular networks and random networks can not reflect the property of the realworld, it shows that the realworld is not well-defined neither is complete random. Watts and Strogatz found a network which contains both small-world and high-aggregation in 1988, which is a great break in the complex network researching. They connected every side to a new node with probability p,through which they build a network between regular network and random network (calling WS net for short), it has less average path length and larger convergence factor, while the regular network and random network are special case when p is 0 and 1 in the WS net.",

The advantage of NW model is that the model simplifies the theory analysis, since the WS model may have orphan nodes which NW would not do.
