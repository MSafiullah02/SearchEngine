            "text": "Epidemiologists have placed much greater emphasis on the measure of response than on the measure of exposure. They claim that this is because most epidemiologists have been trained as physicians and are consequently more oriented toward measuring health outcomes. It is certainly true that a modern textbook of epidemiology says very little about what the epidemiologist should do with exposure assessments. However, this is probably as much a reflection of the historical paucity of quantitative exposure information as a reflection on the background of epidemiologists. Nevertheless, it is surprising how many epidemiological studies do not contain even a basic qualitative assessment of exposure. The contrast between epidemiology and toxicology is never more marked than in the area of estimation of dose response. The toxicologist can carefully control the conditions of exposure to the agent of interest. Moreover, the toxicologist can be sure that the test animals have not come into contact with any other toxic agents. An industrial epidemiologist conducting a study of workers exposed to a hepatotoxin certainly has to control for alcohol intake and possibly for exposure to other hepatotoxins in the work and home environments. Nevertheless, it can be argued that epidemiological studies more accurately measure the effect on human health of \u2018real-life\u2019 exposures.",

However, historical cohort studies are beset by a variety of problems. Principal among these is the problem of determining which workers have been exposed and, if so, to what degree? In addition, it may be difficult to decide what an appropriate comparison group is. It should also be borne in mind that in epidemiology, unlike animal experimentation, random allocation is not possible and there is no control over the factors that may distort the effects of the exposure of interest, such as smoking and the standard of living.

These relationships may be extremely complicated, compounded by factors such as aging, and difficult to estimate because there may be relatively few measurement points. Furthermore, large errors of measurement in the variables may be present because of factors, such as within-laboratory variation and temporal variation within individuals. Missing observations and withdrawals may also cause problems, particularly if they are dependent on the level and change of the parameter of interest.
