In pneumococcal pneumonia, higher interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 concentrations have been found compared to patients with non-pneumococcal etiology [8], [9], [10]. CAP patients with gram-negative etiology, Enterobacteriaceae have been shown in higher IL-8 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in higher IL-10 levels compared to other etiologies [11], [12]. In influenza pneumonia, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 have been shown to be elevated in an acute phase of the disease [13], [14]. Children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia have presented high serum levels of IL-4, IL-10, and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) [14], [15]. However, the precise role of cytokines and the relationship between serum cytokine levels and microbiological etiology among mechanically ventilated SCAP patients is unclear [10], [11].",

All patients fulfilled the criteria for sepsis, as well as, the Infectious Diseases Society of America\u2019s and the American Thoracic Society\u2019s (IDAS/ATS) major criteria for SCAP [1], [16]. Adult patients (older than 18 years) with SCAP who were expected to require intensive care treatment for more than 48 h and who were started on mechanical ventilation during the first 48 h following ICU admission were included in this study.

In influenza A H1N1 virus pneumonia serum IL-5 levels were even higher among those patients requiring mechanical ventilation [19] or in influenza patients without viral pneumonia [21]. In our adult study population, we had only one pneumonic patient with a H1N1 influenza viral infection, while the other pneumonias were due to adeno-, corona-, or rhinovirus infections.

In our study serum IL-6 levels decreased over time in all groups. In general, high IL-6 concentrations in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid have been reported in all pneumonia patients. In addition, high serum IL-6 levels correlate to the presence of pneumonia, disease severity, and poor outcome [10], [12], [23], [24], [25]. In an earlier CAP study with 685 patients of whom 3% required mechanical ventilation and 2.7% with septic shock showed that bacteremic patients had higher serum IL-6 levels compared to CAP patients with an unknown microbial etiology [26]. However, in our study there were no differences between etiologies. Our patients were all severely acutely ill, requiring mechanical ventilation, and 43% had septic shock. Although high serum TNF-\u03b1 levels have been reported in patients with CAP or SCAP [28], we did not find any significant differences in TNF-\u03b1 concentrations between the three etiological groups. This apparent discrepancy between our study and the one of Calbo and colleagues, may be due to different serum sampling times and half-lives of cytokines; the half-life of TNF-\u03b1 after initial cytokine response is relatively short, only 15 min, compared to for instance, IL-6, which according to literature may vary from 2 to 15 h [29]. Thus, in our study serum TNF-\u03b1 levels may have returned to basal levels at the time of hospital admission.",

However, there are thus far only a few studies concerning the patterns of cytokines in SCAP patients. Our study group was relatively small especially in respect to viral pneumonias. Thus, to confirm the elevated serum IL-5 as an informative biomarker for viral infections further studies with a larger patient population are needed. If the ICU admission occurred at nighttime there was at least a few hours delay in obtaining the first study samples, due to the lack of informed consent or laboratory personnel. Therefore, it is possible that we may have missed some very early cytokine findings, specifically, those concerning TNF-\u03b1. Moreover, our results may have been hampered by the fact that 28% of our patients had already received antibiotics before the hospital admission. Our finding should be regarded as preliminary until confirmed in a larger cohort of patients.",
