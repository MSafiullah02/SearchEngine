            "text": "rRNA modifications are concentrated in functional regions such as peptidyl transferase center (PTC) (Decatur and Fournier, 2002). In human ribosomal RNA, there are 91 pseudouridines (\u03a8, Figure 1\nA), 105 2\u2032-O-methylations on backbone sugars (Figure 1B), and ten methylated bases (Piekna-Przybylska et al., 2008). The biological effects of these modifications on rRNA have remained long-term puzzles. The prevailing hypothesis is that they fine-tune the structure and function of ribosome and perhaps play roles during ribosome biogenesis. Modified nucleotides possess distinctive chemical properties that could alter molecular interactions and conformations. For instance, 2\u2032-O-methyl prevents hydrolysis of the phosphate backbone and causes the ribose sugar to favor the 3\u2032 endo conformation (Kawai et al., 1992), and \u03a8 promotes base stacking (Davis, 1995). Both modifications enhance the rigidity and stability of certain RNA secondary structures. While individual rRNA modifications seem to be dispensable, these modifications are vital when considered collectively (Decatur and Fournier, 2002). For example, yeast strains with deficiency in rRNA modifications at PTC showed changes in tRNA selection, altered peptidyl transfer rates, reduced translation fidelity, and sensitivity to translation inhibitors (Baxter-Roshek et al., 2007). Therefore, rRNA modifications around PTC are critical for translation accuracy and efficiency of the ribosome, but the exact structural and functional roles still require further investigation.",

            "text": "Recent studies in yeast revealed that certain tRNA modifications can be quite dynamic and adaptive to environment changes. With a highly accurate mass spectroscopic method, it was shown that the spectrum of tRNA modification has signature shift upon exposure to different toxins (Chan et al., 2010). In response to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, the C34 at the wobble position (the first residue in the anticodon region) of yeast tRNALeu\nCAA is modified by tRNA methyltranfserase 4 (Trm4). The m5C-modified tRNALeu\nCAA enhances the translation of UUG-rich transcripts (Chan et al., 2012) (Figure 1F). The m5C level on tRNAHis (also catalyzed by Trm4) rises in response to nutrient depletion and other growth arrest conditions (Preston et al., 2013). Another yeast tRNA methyltranfsrase, Trm9, completes the formation of mcm5U and mcm5s2U (Figure 1G) at the wobble U34 of tRNAArg\nUCU and tRNAGlu\nUUC; this methylation prevents cell death by promoting translation of DNA damage response genes that are enriched with arginine and glutamic acid codons (Begley et al., 2007). Besides methylation, a tRNA isopentenyltransferase enzyme Mod5 catalyzes the formation of N\n6-isopentenyladeosine (i6A37) at A37 using dimethylally pyrophosphate. This i6A modification is required for tRNA-mediated nonsense suppression (recognition of a premature stop codon by mutant tRNATyr to suppress protein truncation). In parallel, Erg20 utilizes the same substrate, dimethylally pyrophosphate, to produce an essential precursor of sterols, farnesyl pyrophosphate. Therefore, Mod5 and Erg20 compete for their common substrate. Overexpression of Erg20 elevates the influx of the common substrate to sterol pathway, reducing formation of i6A in tRNATyr, thereby changing translation due to altered nonsense suppression (Benko et al., 2000). The coupling of tRNA modification and sterol biogenesis was further strengthened by the discovery that Mod5 can regulate sterol metabolic pathway via a prion state (Suzuki et al., 2012). Besides enzymatic function, some tRNA modifying enzymes, such as tRNA pesudouridylases TruB, can also function as tRNA chaperone to facilitate maturation of tRNA (Gutgsell et al., 2000).",

It was initially discovered in 1974, together with 5\u2032 cap methylation (Desrosiers et al., 1974, Desrosiers et al., 1975). However, progress on m6A research lagged far behind that of the cap, probably because of the low abundance of mRNA and difficulties in detection. Early studies showed that on average every mammalian mRNA contains three to five m6A within a G(m6A)C (70%) or A(m6A)C (30%) consensus sequence (Wei et al., 1976, Wei and Moss, 1977), but the methylation percentage at each site varies substantially (Kane and Beemon, 1985, Carroll et al., 1990). m6A is posttranscriptionally installed by an m6A methyltransferase complex (Tuck, 1992, Bokar et al., 1994). The identification of a SAM-binding subunit (METTL3) of the complex (Bokar et al., 1997) allowed scientists to examine m6A in model organisms. The resulting work showed that m6A is crucial for yeast meiosis (Shah and Clancy, 1992, Clancy et al., 2002, Schwartz et al., 2013), and for fruit fly (Hongay and Orr-Weaver, 2011) and plant development (Zhong et al., 2008). The m6A methylation also appears to be essential for mammalian cells (Bokar, 2005).",

            "text": "In the last 4 years, the field has witnessed a major revival focusing on functional roles of m6A in eukaryotic mRNA (Fu et al., 2014), initiated by (1) a conceptual conjecture that reversible RNA modification might serve regulatory roles analogous to DNA and histone epigenetic modifications (He, 2010, Yi and Pan, 2011), followed by the subsequent discovery of the first mRNA demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity-associated protein) that reverses m6A modification (Jia et al., 2011); (2) the development of an antibody-based high-throughput m6A profiling method, m6A-seq (Dominissini et al., 2012) or MeIP-seq (Meyer et al., 2012, Meyer and Jaffrey, 2014); and (3) the discovery and characterization of selective m6A-binding proteins that impact the stability of mRNA (Dominissini et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2014a). As a reversible mark analogous to methylations on DNA and histone tails, m6A on mRNA is installed, erased, and recognized by m6A methyltransferase, demethylase, and m6A-specific binding proteins. We have recently shown that METTL3 forms a stable heterodimer with METTL14 as the enzymatic core of the m6A methyltransferase complex and biochemically reconstituted their methylation activity (Liu et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2014b). In addition, the heterodimer also interacts with a splicing regulator, WTAP, which affects the m6A level inside cells (Liu et al., 2014, Ping et al., 2014). The interaction between WTAP and m6A methyltransferase is also conserved in yeast (Agarwala et al., 2012) and plants (Zhong et al., 2008). Early studies indicated that a large protein complex (200 kDa + 800 kDa) mediates this methylation (Tuck, 1992, Bokar et al., 1994), hence other important protein factors surrounding the enzymatic core remain to be identified. Only a fraction of the all consensus sequences in mammalian mRNA are methylated. The methylation selectivity and its response to various cellular signals and stimuli remain to be elucidated in the future.",

            "text": "Functional understanding of m6A has lagged in part because of limited research on potential reader proteins that can selectively bind the methylated transcripts and mediate biological functions. Potential candidate proteins have been reported in RNA-affinity pull-down experiments using methylated RNA probes (Dominissini et al., 2012). Three members of human YTH domain family proteins (YTHDF1\u20133) exhibit 5- to 20-fold higher binding affinity for methylated RNAs compared to unmethylated RNA (Wang et al., 2014a). In particular, YTHDF2 has been shown to affect the stability of m6A-containing RNA and localize the methylated mRNA from translatable pool to mRNA decay sites, such as processing bodies in parallel or at a later stage of deadenylation (Wang et al., 2014a). Interestingly, m6A-containing transcripts are enriched with regulatory genes (transcription factors, etc.) and inherently possess shorter half-live than nonmethylated species (Fu et al., 2014), suggesting that the m6A-dependent mRNA turnover serves as a mechanism to dynamically affect expression of these genes (Wang and He, 2014). The m6A methylation has been shown to affect stability of transcriptional regulators in mouse embryonic stem cells (Wang et al., 2014b), and two recent studies on yeast further support the notion that one main function of m6A is likely to affect transcript stability. Mmi1 in fission yeast is homologous to human YTH domain-containing proteins and is responsible for selectively eliminating meiotic mRNA transcripts during vegetative growth (Harigaya et al., 2006, Hiriart et al., 2012). Ydr374c (Pho92 or MRB1), the YTH domain homolog in budding yeast, binds the m6A-containing RNA and seems to regulate the transcript stability of a key gene involved in phosphate signal transduction pathway in response to changing phosphate levels by interacting with the Pop2-Ccr4-Not deadenylation complex (Kang et al., 2014).",

Demethylases balance the methylation stoichiometry of specific mRNAs, perhaps in a pathway- and cell-type-specific manner. The m6A \u201creader\u201d proteins are at the end of information processing, executing the biological functions of m6A on specific transcripts through rapid and localized reading of the m6A mark.

In mRNA, these sites are enriched in untranslated regions and around Argonaute binding sites. By using both bisulfite sequencing and immunoprecipitation with anti-m5C antibody followed by sequencing, 14 m5C sites were verified in archaeal (S. solfataricus) mRNA with a consensus motif of AU(m5C)GANGU, similar to the m5C sites on S. solfataricus rRNA, suggesting a shared m5C methyltransferase in the deposition of m5C (Edelheit et al., 2013). Several genes bearing m5C are enzymes involved in energy and lipid metabolism, possibly indicating a regulatory role of m5C in metabolic processes. Several m5C methyltransferases that were thought to work on rRNA and tRNA have binding sites on mRNA, suggesting additional roles that impact mRNA (Zhang et al., 2012, Khoddami and Cairns, 2013, Hussain et al., 2013).",

Pseudouridine modification provides an additional hydrogen-bonding donor that can significantly affect the secondary structure of RNA. Its presence on mRNA could impact translation by affecting the secondary structures of mRNA or recruiting potential reader proteins. A recent inspiring work showed that replacing the first uridine of the stop codon to psedourindine can convert nonsense (stop) codon to sense codon, thus raising the possibility of expanding the genetic codon or recoding transcripts by introducing RNA modifications on mRNA (Karijolich and Yu, 2011). More recently, transcriptome-wide mapping has uncovered hundreds of naturally occurring psedourindine sites in yeast and human mRNA. These pseudouridine sites are responsive to nutrition starvation and heat shock (Carlile et al., 2014, Schwartz et al., 2014), suggesting mRNA pseudouridylation as a potential mechanism to rapidly adapt the translation landscape to environmental stress.",

The 5\u2032-terminal capping is essential to the exportation of U snRNAs to cytoplasm from nucleus (Dickmanns and Ficner, 2005). snRNAs also contain internal modifications such as \u03a8, 2\u2032-O-methylation, and m6A.

For example, m6A has been suggested to act as a pacesetter of the mammalian circadian clock (Fustin et al., 2013) and a switch for yeast meiotic entrance (Shah and Clancy, 1992, Agarwala et al., 2012). As discussed above, various RNA modifications are responsive to changes in nutrient and metabolite levels, probably because the modifications require energy to produce and because cofactors like SAM, iron, and \u03b1-KG are shared by RNA-modifying enzymes and metabolic enzymes (Figure 2). We expect that future studies will reveal further connections between RNA modifications and cell metabolism, and they may connect RNA modifications to human diseases like cancer, in part, through effects on metabolism. Because the functions of mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA directly connect to translation, modifications on these RNA species could significantly determine the outcome of protein production, localized and general, to affect states of the cell in various contexts, such as localized translation in neurons.",

Could reversible RNA modification be heritable too? Several promising directions could be explored to address this question. RNA modification might be involved in maternal effect. At the early stage of embryo development, transcription is inactivated and protein expression is dominated by the translation of prestored maternal mRNA (Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009). Therefore, any shift in the modification pattern of maternal mRNA would have a profound effect on zygotic development, and if such a change is remembered at the posttranscriptional or transcriptional level, it could be passed on to the next generation. Similarly, RNA modifications could mark different transcripts during meiosis and/or mitosis to affect transfer of inheritable information between generations.",

The recent developments in highly sensitive technologies have revolutionized research on RNA modifications, in particular on low-abundance RNA species. These developments include (1) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy followed by mass fingerprinting (LC-MS/MS), which enables accurate quantification of modified nucleosides with unambiguous chemical identity with fmol (10\u221215) sensitivity, and (2) next-generation sequencing coupled with modification-specific antibodies, which enables transcriptome-wide profiling of RNA modification sites. While LC-MS/MS provides quantification for a population of RNA and sequencing qualitatively locates candidate modification sites, there has been a lack of a high-throughput method available to determine precise modification sites and the stoichiometry for each modification at those sites.",

However, similar chemistry is not always available for other base modifications. For example, the dynamic m6A methylation is nonstoichiometric on mRNA, and the balance of methyltransferase/demethylase activities indeed has physiological consequences. So far, SCARLET (site-specific cleavage and radioactive labeling followed by ligation-assisted extraction and thin-layer chromatography) is the only reported method to directly determine the presence and fraction of m6A at single-nucleotide resolution (Liu et al., 2013), but it is low-throughput. The use of m6A-sensitive reverse transcription enzymes to detect the kinetic delay or stall at the m6A site (Vilfan et al., 2013, Harcourt et al., 2013) and the protein-modified nanopore sequencing (Laszlo et al., 2013, Schreiber et al., 2013) might be promising, but they are still not ready to be used in real applications. A method that could detect modifications with limited input materials (e.g., RNA isolated from a single cell) is also lacking. The dynamics in each individual cell and effects on early developmental events of RNA modifications can be learned with new technologies. Since every RNA modification has its own unique biochemical/chemical property, the solution to efficiently detect and distinguish each of them remains challenging for chemists, biochemist, and biologists.",

The m6A eraser proteins (FTO and AlkBH5) further tune the methylation stoichiometry, perhaps in a more pathway-specific manner. The m6A reader proteins (e.g., YTHDF family proteins) recognize the m6A code and execute biological functions. YTHDF2 promotes the decay of the m6A-containing RNA while other reader proteins could potentially affect the translation, storage, or nuclear export of methylated RNA. All these proteins could couple their functions with cellular signaling pathways, responses to environmental stimuli, or programmed biological transformations.
