Since September 2012, 27 countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, the United States of America and Asia have reported cases of MERS\u2010CoV. Globally, 2143 laboratory\u2010confirmed cases of MERS\u2010CoV and at least 750 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), 82% of whom were from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. According to the latest WHO report (26 January 2018) related to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 20 cases including nine deaths have been reported between December 9, 2017 and January 17, 2018 (Organization, 2017). The largest MERS outbreak outside of Saudi Arabia has occurred in South Korea with 186 cases and 39 deaths (CFR: 21%) from May to July 2015 (Chen, Chughtai, Dyda, & MacIntyre, 2017). Most people infected with MERS\u2010CoV developed a severe respiratory illness with clinical symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Others may develop gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea or vomiting, and kidney failure. MERS can be life\u2010threatening. Many deaths due to MERS\u2010CoV have been reported (Al\u2010Tawfiq & Memish, 2016). The highest virus loads are found in the lower respiratory tract samples, although low concentrations of viral RNA can also be found in stool, urine, and blood samples (Drosten et al., 2013).",

The 5' end of the genome contains two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode two polyproteins (pp), pp1a and pp1ab; production of pp1ab requires a ribosomal frameshift to transcribe the portion encoded by ORF1b. ORF1a encodes viral proteases, main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro), and papain\u2010like protease (PLpro), which are responsible for cleavage of the ORF1a and ORF1b. These polyproteins are further cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins, whereas the 3\u2032 end of the viral genome encodes four structural proteins (E, N, S, and M; Mustafa, Balkhy, & Gabere, 2017).

They are difficult to study because of their low expression level as well as their low molecular weight. In addition, they are not conserved in the coronavirus subfamilies. Although the accessory proteins can be targeted by antiviral therapeutics, the biological function of these proteins is still not well understood. MERS\u2010CoV has five accessory proteins: 3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b, encoded by various ORFs (Durai et al., 2015). Figure 1 provides details on the organization of the MERS\u2010CoV genome.",

DPP4, a 766\u2010aa\u2010long type\u2010II transmembrane glycoprotein, is mainly expressed on epithelial cells and controls the activity of hormones and chemokines (Bosch, Raj, & Haagmans, 2013; Chan, Lau, & Woo, 2013; Zhang, Jiang, & Du, 2014). This receptor binds to a 231 residue region in the spike (S) protein of MERS\u2010CoV, a domain different from the receptor\u2010binding site of other Betacoronaviruses. The S protein and the receptor\u2010binding site within this protein induce neutralizing antibodies and, in principle, could serve as a subunit vaccine (Lu et al., 2013; Mou et al., 2013). Small molecules or peptides that prevent the binding of DPP4 are potential MERS\u2010CoV entry inhibitors, and a few have been identified. Adenosine deaminase, a DPP4 binding protein, acts as a competitive inhibitor for MERS\u2010CoV S protein (Raj et al., 2014). An anti\u2010cluster of differentiation 26 (CD26) polyclonal antibody has also shown inhibitory effects on MERS\u2010CoV infection in vitro (Ohnuma et al., 2013).",

The virulence of these human infections is undeniably linked to immune evasion mechanisms. Viruses have learned how to manipulate host immune control mechanisms. Our knowledge of viral gene functions could lead to new antiviral strategies and the ability to exploit viral functions as tools in medicine (Alcami & Koszinowski, 2000).

The innate response elicited by an invading pathogen involves the rapid recognition of general molecular patterns by nonimmune cells or cells of the innate immune system, such as monocytes or macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells (Nicholson, 2016). Hence, the first barrier to overcome for successful viral infection is the rapid innate immune response of the host, which are involved in several effector mechanisms, including complement cascade, type I Interferons (IFNs), inflammatory cytokine, NK cell immunity, apoptosis, autophagy, and toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) pathway. When the innate immune system confronts a pathogen, it becomes activated and prepares the adaptive arm of the immune system to respond appropriately (Takeuchi & Akira, 2009).",

Yang et al., 2013). Using chimeric and truncation mutants, the N\u2010terminal transmembrane domains of the MERS\u2010CoV M protein were found to be sufficient for its inhibitory effect on IFN expression, whereas the C\u2010terminal domain was unable to induce this suppression (Lui et al., 2016). MERS\u2010CoV M protein suppresses IRF3 activity but not NF\u2010\u03baB signaling. It is known that the activation of RIG\u2010I and MAVS results in activation of both IRF3 and NF\u2010\u03baB (Seth et al., 2005; Yoneyama et al., 2004). MERS\u2010CoV M protein is capable of differentially suppressing the RIG\u2010I\u2010induced activation of IRF3. M protein interacts with TRAF3 and disrupts TRAF3\u2013TBK1 association, leading to reduced activation of IRF3 (Lui et al., 2016). TRAF3 functions as an adapter that bridges the mitochondrial transducer MAVS with the downstream signaling complex containing TBK1 and IKK\u2010\u025b kinases that are essential for IRF3 activation (Guo & Cheng, 2007). SARS\u2010CoV M protein also prevents the formation of TRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK\u2010\u025b complex leading to reduced IRF3 activation and thereby inhibits IFN production (Siu et al., 2009). MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV are two highly pathogenic coronaviruses that have caused hundreds of deaths (Coleman et al., 2016). M proteins of MERS\u2010CoV and SARS\u2010CoV have high sequence similarity (>70%; Lui et al., 2016). In contrast, M protein encoded by human coronavirus HKU1, associated with common cold, has no influence on IFN production. HKU1 is commonly found in human population and is associated with less severe respiratory illnesses and has 35% identity with full M proteins of SARS coronavirus (Kanwar, Selvaraju, & Esper, 2017; Siu, Chan, Kok, Chiu\u2010Yat Woo, & Jin, 2014).",

The ubiquitin pathway is important for regulating a number of innate immune pathways, and the ability of a viral protein to cleave ubiquitin from host cell proteins can contribute to virus pathogenesis. In addition to ubiquitination, modification of cellular proteins with ISG15 is known to have a broad spectrum antiviral activity. ISG15 is the ubiquitin\u2010like protein that can be conjugated to cellular targets via a mechanism called ISGylation, regulating innate immune responses. Coronavirus PLPs are known to have the ability to remove ISG15 conjugates from cellular substrates and reduces the levels of ubiquitinated and ISGylated host cell proteins (Clementz et al., 2010).

There is an urgent need for developing the most effective MERS therapy. More research findings on the pathogenesis and immune evasion mechanisms of MERS\u2010CoV may help to improve the treatment and control of MERS. Reliable vaccines have not yet been developed but antivirals inhibiting virus replication, such as mycophenolic acid, cyclosporine A, IFN\u2010\u03b1, IFN\u2010\u03b2, or ribavirin are available. The attenuated viruses generated might prove useful in vaccine development. Reverse genetics system is a tool to study the molecular biology of the virus, understanding novel gene functions, high\u2010throughput screening of antiviral drugs, and to develop attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates. Using this system a collection of MERS\u2010CoV deletion mutants has been generated. If deletion of genes that causing the virus to escape from the immune system presented growth kinetics similar to those of the wild\u2010type virus, indicating which is helpful to prevent MERS\u2010CoV infection.",
