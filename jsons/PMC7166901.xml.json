Costs attributable to viral lower respiratory tract infections in both outpatient and inpatient settings are a significant burden on healthcare budgets [Arnold et al., 2006]. Viruses are responsible for the majority of acute respiratory tract infections, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (INF), parainfluenza viruse (PIV), adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) considered the most common pathogens. Thus, high\u2010throughput, accurate, broad\u2010range tools for etiologic diagnosis are critical for maintaining reasonable use of antibiotics and effective epidemic control.",

Recent advances in molecular biology, particularly the introduction of the real\u2010time PCR assay, have improved greatly the detection of individual viral respiratory pathogens [Louie et al., 2005] and promoted the development of multiplex assays that can detect simultaneously multiple pathogens in a single test. Some of these multiplex technologies have potential applications in high\u2010throughput testing, and others allow rapid, near\u2010patient testing. However, these assays are still not used widely in clinical laboratories, and most are currently available only for research use. More studies are needed to elucidate their performance characteristics and to determine their ideal clinical applications [Caliendo, 2011].",

            "text": "Consistent with other clinical trial data [Chen et al., 2011a, 2011b], PCR/ESI\u2010MS demonstrated several advantages over regular DFA in detecting respiratory viruses. First, the time to first result from sample preparation to detection of PCR/ESI\u2010MS was 6 hr: 0.5 hr of RNA extraction, 3 hr of RT\u2010PCR, and 2.5 hr of processing in ESI\u2010MS. The estimated throughput of PCR/ESI\u2010MS was 90 samples with automatic nucleic acid extraction, using one technician working for 8 hr, which represented 1,530 PCR reactions. However, DFA may require at least two persons to complete the same number of samples within one working day. Second, more viruses were detected using PCR/ESI\u2010MS, especially PIV3, INF A, and RSV. These viruses are the major viral agents that cause lower respiratory tract infections, but their prevalence may be underestimated because of the low sensitivity of DFA [Sloots et al., 2008]. Third, nine viral co\u2010infection samples were verified by PCR/ESI\u2010MS, whereas only two were detected by DFA. Dual viral infections were predominant, but co\u2010infections with three different viruses were observed in two samples. As of this writing, the clinical importance of such multiple viral infections remains uncertain [Paranhos\u2010Baccala et al., 2008]. Our findings indicated that PCR/ESI\u2010MS can provide more information than DFA on viral co\u2010infections in patients. The additional data will help in clarifying the association of the simultaneous presence of more than one viral pathogen with epidemiological and clinical features that differ from those in single infections, especially with respect to disease type and severity. Fourth, a more detailed pathogen characterization, especially type and subtype information from RSV, adenovirus, and INF, was obtained directly and rapidly using PCR/ESI\u2010MS. Such detailed information was not obtained using DFA or conventional PCR. The key feature of this new technology is the use of MS to quickly and accurately detect the amplicons and \u201cweigh\u201d them with sufficient mass accuracy to determine the nucleotide base compositions that are associated with sequence information to identify and genotype the virus in the sample.",

Moreover, the fact that no coronavirus was detected by PCR/ESI\u2010MS and DFA in this study which was similar to that in another report [Chen et al., 2011b] showed the low detection rate of conronavirus and indicated that more specimens need to be collected for evaluating the diagnostic characteristic of PLEX\u2010ID respiratory kit on conronavirus. Unlike other assays based on antigen detection or nucleic acid amplification, which are limited to the detection of known microbes, PCR/ESI\u2010MS is suitable for discovery of pathogens and evaluation of emerging pathogens. In PCR/ESI\u2010MS, the base compositions are compared with a database of calculated base compositions from the sequences of known organisms to determine the identities of the microorganisms present. However, when no match is found between the measured base composition and the database, the nearest neighbor organism is identified. Thus, PCR/ESI\u2010MS provides information about pathogens in a sample without having to anticipate the pathogens that might be present [Caliendo, 2011]. This unique technology will be helpful in the rapid identification of pathogens with regard to emerging or reemerging infectious diseases and outbreaks.",
