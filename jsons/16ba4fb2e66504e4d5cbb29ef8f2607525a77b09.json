The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is also higher in regional and remote populations, and people with known CVD have increased morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 . In addition, COVID-19 is associated with serious cardiac manifestations, potentially placing additional demand on limited regional services at a time of diminished visiting metropolitan support with restricted travel. Inter-hospital transfer is currently challenging as receiving centres enact pandemic protocols, creating potential delays, and cardiovascular resources are diverted to increasing intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency department (ED) capacity. Regional and rural centres have limited staff resources, placing cardiac services at risk in the event of staff infection or quarantine during the pandemic.",

Identification of patients with device malfunction or approaching battery end-of-life is a potentially lifethreatening issue, particularly if the pandemic-related decline of services continues for several months.Regional hospitals may need to provide small clinics, avoiding overcrowding, to check devices of patients without access to remote monitoring, or who require device reprogramming.
