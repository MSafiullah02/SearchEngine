It has given insight into the origins, evolutionary history, transmission routes and source populations of epidemic outbreaks and seasonal diseases. One of the key observations about rapidly evolving viruses is that the evolutionary and ecological processes occur on the same time scale (Pybus and Rambaut, 2009). This is important for two reasons. First, it means that neutral genetic variation can track ecological processes and population dynamics, providing a record of past evolutionary events (e.g., genealogical relationships) and past ecological/population events (geographical spread and changes in population size and structure) that were not directly observed. Second, the concomitance of evolutionary and ecological processes leads to their interaction that, when non-trivial, necessitates joint analysis.",

These have shed light on many aspects of HIV evolutionary biology, epidemiology, origins, phylogeography, transmission dynamics and drug resistance. In fact, the vast body of literature on HIV makes it clear that almost every aspect of the biology of a rapidly evolving pathogen can be better understood in the context of the evolution of the virus. Whether it is retracing the zoonotic origins of the HIV pandemic or describing the interplay between the virus population and its host\u2019s immune system, a phylogenetic analysis frequently sheds light.",

            "text": "Although probabilistic modeling approaches to phylogenetics predate Sanger sequencing (Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza, 1965), it was not until the last decade that probabilistic modeling became the dominant approach to phylogeny reconstruction. Part of that dominance has been due to the rise of Bayesian inference (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001), with its great flexibility in describing prior knowledge, its ability to be applied via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to complex highly parametric models, and the ease with which multiple sources of data can be integrated into a single analysis. The history of probabilistic models of molecular evolution and phylogenetics is a history of gradual refinement; a process of selection of those modeling variations that have the greatest utility in characterizing the ever-growing empirical data. The utility of a new model has been evaluated either by how well it fits the data (formal model comparison or goodness-of-fit tests) or by the new questions that it allows a researcher to ask of the data. In this review we will describe the modern phylogenetic approach to the field of infectious diseases, and particularly with reference to Bayesian inference of the phylogenetic epidemiology of rapidly evolving viral pathogens such as Hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV and Influenza A virus. The review is separated into two main sections. In Section 2 we discuss phylogenetic methods for reconstructing the history of infectious epidemics, including identification of origins, dating of common ancestors, relaxed phylogenetics and coalescent-based population dynamics. In Section 3 we review epidemiological models and finish by outlining progress in the development of phylodynamical models that marry statistical phylogenetics with dynamical modeling.",

The reconstruction of phylogenetic trees to infer the evolutionary relationships has been a key tool to uncover the origin of regional epidemics such as those resulting from HIV (Gao et al., 1999, Santiago et al., 2002), HCV (Pybus et al., 2009, Markov et al., 2009) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Li et al., 2005). Some studies have also attempted to use phylogenetic trees to draw conclusions about transmission history and geographic spread of viral epidemics (Motomura et al., 2003, Santiago et al., 2005, Gilbert et al., 2007). However, great care should be taken when coming to conclusions about aspects of the epidemic process that are not explicitly modeled in the reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree and even if they are, the user needs to consider the appropriateness of the underlying model assumptions.",

Although SIVcpz became the prime candidate for the zoonotic source of HIV-1 as soon as it was identified, alternative sources could not be ruled out due to the paucity of identified chimpanzee infections (Vanden Haesevelde et al., 1996). The source of HIV-1 was confirmed much later after the collection of SIVcpz from fecal samples of wild P. t. troglodytes apes in the Cameroon forest (Keele et al., 2006). HIV-1 groups M and N are much more closely related to sequences from the fecal samples than previously identified SIVcpz strains. This finding uncovered the distinct origins of HIV-1 group M (pandemic) and group N (non-pandemic) traced to chimpanzee communities of southeastern and central Cameroon respectively. The precise geographic identification of these wildlife chimpanzee reservoirs of HIV-1 by phylogenetic techniques provided the crucial evidence that SIVcpz gave rise to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.",

            "text": "The interspersion of an emergent viral strain with other strains in a phylogenetic tree is often interpreted as evidence supporting multiple independent viral introductions. For example, HIV lineages are paraphyletic with SIV lineages creating several separate clusters of HIV suggesting multiple zoonotic viral transmissions into the human population (Santiago et al., 2005, Keele et al., 2006). While it is intuitive that separate clusters of the emergent virus suggest multiple introductions, it is not clear from the number of clusters alone how many independent events are responsible for the observed pattern. Incomplete taxon sampling will lead to undercounting. For example, there may exist an unsampled sequence that will split an emergent viral cluster, or an additional unsampled emergent cluster. Both scenarios, if detected, would increase the lower bound of the inferred number of events. The number of events could also be incorrectly estimated due to phylogenetic estimation error. Finally, in situations where the event is potentially reversible, such as with drug-resistance mutations, e.g., adamantane resistance in H3N2 influenza virus (Nelson et al., 2009), it is quite possible that reversions are also present in the phylogenetic history, and these are not always detectable by a simple parsimony reconstruction, again leading to undercounting. For all these reasons, the applications of Bayesian modeling of phylogeography and character evolution on phylogenies is crucial to quantitatively assess the uncertainty generated from these different sources of error (see Section 2.4).",

It was suggested by (Santiago et al., 2005) that the geographic origin of HIV-2 groups A and B are in the eastern sooty mangabey range according to the clear geographic clustering displayed in the phylogenetic tree and branching position of the HIV-2 strains. Although this heuristic approach to locating phylogeographic origins is commonly used, it has several disadvantages aside from the sampling error mentioned earlier. First, it relies on strong geographic signals to produce an unambiguous geographic clustering pattern in the trees. Second, the lack of a formal statistical framework results in an inability to quantify the associated uncertainty with the geographic estimates. A number of statistical phylogenetic methods aim to reconstruct the migration process by treating geographic locations as another state that evolves down the tree. The states are either discrete (Lemey et al., 2009b), denoted by names of cities or provinces, or continuous represented by the latitude and longitude of the location (Biek et al., 2006, Biek et al., 2007, Lemey et al., 2010).",

Reassortment arises when segments of the viral genome come from different viruses, while recombination also requires the genetic material from one source to (break and) join with that from another. These two processes enable the generation of novel combinations from two existing genotypes. Moreover, these often large genetic changes may provide the potential for adaptation to a new host species (Parrish et al., 2008). Reassortment has played an important role in the evolution of the Influenza A virus (Lindstrom et al., 2004, Holmes et al., 2005, Nelson et al., 2008). Evidence for recombination have also been found in Dengue (Holmes et al., 1999), HIV, HCV and SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2006).",

Most of these methods use a sliding window approach to compute a summary statistic along the length of sequence. Phylogenetic approaches are based on estimating either (i) bootstrap values or (ii) clade posterior probabilities for each window and a sudden change in bootstrap value, clade posterior probability or site percentage identity is an indication of the presence of a breakpoint around the region. Other methods explicitly estimate the position of the breakpoint in an alignment, providing access to test the strength of support for recombination (Holmes et al., 1999).

This second source of rate variation among lineages may be better modeled by uncorrelated relaxed clock models (Drummond et al., 2006), which make no assumption about the autocorrelation of rates between ancestral and descendent branches.

One method of identifying the time of the host-switch is by applying non-homogeneous substitution models. The motivation of non-homogeneous substitution models is to acknowledge possible differences in pattern of substitution in the virus within different host species, which violates the assumptions of homogeneity and stationarity underlying the standard substitution models. Therefore it may be more appropriate to apply different substitution models to different parts of the tree (Forsberg and Christiansen, 2003). Non-homogeneous substitution models permit the equilibrium frequencies, and hence the model parameters, to change on a branch and all the descendant lineages from the point of change are assumed to have different equilibrium base frequencies to the lineages prior to that point. This technique has been used to suggest that the immediate ancestral population of 1918 Influenza A virus resided in a mammalian host (Reis et al., 2009). However, it does not indicate whether the most recent common ancestor of the swine Influenza virus and the 1918 virus resided in humans or other mammals.",

There may be direct ancestors that are more ancient, but the lineages that would reveal them have not been sampled or did not survive to the present due to processes such as genetic drift. Therefore, the estimated t\nMRCA may not answer the question of interest. For epidemics that resulted from a zoonotic transmission, the host switch event is of paramount interest, but estimating the t\nMRCA of the epidemic strain does not directly estimate the time of the transmission, and only serves as a lower bound. Likewise, if there have been processes causing a loss of genetic diversity in the past or the sampling is not comprehensive, then the estimated t\nMRCA could be substantially younger than the age of the viral lineage. An obvious example of the former occurs in seasonal influenza due to seasonal population fluctuations and also strong positive Darwinian selection caused by immune surveillance (Fitch et al., 1991, Bush et al., 1999), leading to rapid lineage turnover and a recent common ancestor of any single-season sample.",

The impact of Darwinian selection is expressed both in distortions of the genealogy (O\u2019Fallon, 2010, O\u2019Fallon et al., 2010) and the substitution process (e.g., Bloom et al., 2007, Cartwright et al., 2011) from neutral expectations. Consideration of the action of pervasive purifying selection is especially important in viral genomes prone to clonal interference and which are compact, information rich and subject to great levels of functional and structural constraint in their evolutionary trajectories, especially when considering long time periods. Beyond that there is also a need for more statistically rigorous methods of incorporating diverse sources of calibration information, such as biogeography, archaeology and paleontological evidence.

The epidemic history of HIV-2 was investigated using the generalized skyline plot (Strimmer and Pybus, 2001), indicating the population size was relatively constant in the early history of HIV-2 subtype A in Guinea-Bissau, before expanding more recently (Lemey et al., 2003).

This shortcoming is overcome by implementing the skyline plot method in a Bayesian statistical framework, which simultaneously infers the sample genealogy, the substitution parameters and the population size history. Further extensions of the generalized skyline plot include modeling the population size by a piecewise-linear function instead of a piecewise-constant population, allowing continuous changes over time rather than sudden jumps. The Bayesian skyline plot (Drummond et al., 2005) has been used to suggest that the effective population size of HIV-1 group M may have grown at a relatively slower rate in the first half of the twentieth century, followed by much faster growth (Worobey et al., 2008). On a much shorter time scale, the Bayesian skyline plot analysis of a dataset collected from a pair of HIV-1 donor and recipient was used to reveal a substantial loss of genetic diversity following virus transmission (Edwards et al., 2006). Further analysis with a constant-logistic growth model estimated that more than 99% of the genetic diversity of HIV-1 present in the donor is lost during horizontal transmission. This has important implications as the process underlying the bottleneck determines the viral fitness in the recipient host.",

A recent study of Influenza A H5N1 virus introduced a fully probabilistic \u2018mugration\u2019 approach by modeling the process of geographic movement of viral lineages via a continuous time Markov process where the state space consists of the locations from which the sequences have been sampled (Lemey et al., 2009b). This facilitates the estimation of migration rates between pairs of locations. Furthermore, the method estimates ancestral locations for internal nodes in the tree and employs Bayesian variable selection (BVS) to infer the dominant migration routes and provide model averaging over uncertainty in the connectivity between different locations (or host populations). This method has helped with the investigation of the Influenza A H5N1 origin and the paths of its global spread, and also the reconstruction of the initial spread of the novel H1N1 human Influenza A pandemic (Lemey et al., 2009b). However, a shared limitation of models for discrete location states is that ancestral locations are limited to sampled locations. As demonstrated by the analysis of the data set on rabies in dogs in West and Central Africa, absence of sequences sampled close to the root can hinder the accurate estimation of viral geographic origins (Lemey et al., 2009b). Phylogeographic estimation is therefore improved by increasing both the spatial density and the temporal depth of sampling. However, dense geographic sampling leads to large phylogenies and computationally intensive analyses.",

The serial structured coalescent was first applied to an HIV dataset with two demes to study the dynamics of subpopulations within a patient (Ewing et al., 2004), but the same type of inference can be made at the level of the host population. Further development of the model allowed for the number of demes to change over time (Ewing and Rodrigo, 2006a).

The phylogeography of wildlife host populations have often been modeled in a spatial continuum by using diffusion models, since viral spread and host movement tend to be poorly modeled by a small number of discrete demes. One example is the expansion of geographic range in eastern United States of the raccoon-specific rabies virus (Biek et al., 2007, Lemey et al., 2010). Brownian diffusion, via the comparative method (Felsenstein, 1985, Harvey and Pagel, 1991), has also been utilized to model the phylogeography of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus collected from the cougar (Puma concolor) population around western Montana. The resulting phylogeographic reconstruction was used as proxy for the host demographic history and population structure, due to the predominantly vertical transmission of the virus (Biek et al., 2006). However, one of the assumptions of Brownian diffusion is rate homogeneity on all branches. This assumption can be relaxed by extending the concept of relaxed clock models to the diffusion process (Lemey et al., 2010). Simulations show that the relaxed diffusion model has better coverage and statistical efficiency over Brownian diffusion when the underlying process of spatial movement resembles an over-dispersed random walk.",

            "text": "Like their mugration model counterparts, these models ignore the interaction of population density and geographic spread in shaping the sample genealogy. However there has been progress in the development of mathematical theory that extends the coalescent framework to a spatial continuum (Barton et al., 2002, Barton et al., 2010a, Barton et al., 2010b), although no methods have yet been developed providing inference under these models.Box 1:The anatomy of a Bayesian coalescent analysis using MCMCBayesian phylogenetic inference by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (Yang and Rannala, 1997, Mau et al., 1999) involves the simulation of the joint posterior distribution of substitution model parameters (\u03d5) and the phylogenetic tree given the sequence data (D). By restricting the phylogenetic model to time-trees (see Fig. 1) and coupling the phylogenetic likelihood with a coalescent prior, the parameters (\u03b8) of the population history, N\n\u03b8(t), can also be estimated simultaneously by sampling from the posterior probability distribution (Drummond et al., 2002): (2)f\u03b8g\u03d5(\u03b8,g,\u03d5|D)=1Pr(D)Pr(D|g,\u03d5)fG(g|\u03b8)f\u0398(\u03b8)f\u03a6(\u03d5).\nTheterm Pr(D\u2223g,\u03d5) is often referred to as the phylogenetic likelihood, and is the probability of the data given the time-tree g and substitution model parameters. It can be computed by the pruning algorithm (Felsenstein, 1981), which efficiently sums over all ancestral sequence states at the internal nodes of the tree. An extension of the likelihood accommodates heterogeneity across sites (Yang, 1994). If the time-tree g relates a heterochronous sample of sequences, then the substitution parameters \u03d5 also includes the overall substitution rate \u03bc, and this can be estimated from the heterochronous data, so that the population history is estimated on a calendar scale. The normalizing constant Pr(D) is also known as the partition function or marginal likelihood and its magnitude provides a measure of model support, although its estimation requires advanced MCMC techniques (e.g., thermodynamic integration or transdimensional MCMC).Coalescent models come into play when determining the prior density for the time-tree topology and coalescent/divergence times. The coalescent provides a probability distribution, f\nG(g\u2223\u03b8), conditional on a deterministic model of population size history, N\n\u03b8(t). Its parameters (\u03b8) can in turn be estimated as hyperparameters. Given a time-tree g\n = {E\ng,t} of n contemporaneous samples composed of an edge graph E\ng and coalescent times t\n = {t\nn\n = 0,t\nn\u22121, \u2026 ,t\n2,t\n1} the coalescent density is: (3)fG(g|\u03b8)=\u220fi=1n-1N\u03b8(ti)-1exp-\u222btiti+1n2N\u03b8(t)dt.\nTheprior distributions f\n\u0398(\u03b8) and f\n\u03a6(\u03d5) are usually selected from standard univariate or multivariate distributions.\n",

However such approaches are not adequate for modeling systems in which small numbers of individuals are frequently involved. For a similar reason, it is awkward to reconcile large-limit deterministic models with the small sample genealogies that are obtained with molecular phylogenetic approaches. Therefore, stochastic continuous-time discrete-state formulations of epidemic models may be more suited to forming connections between the two disciplines. The forward simulations of a stochastic epidemic model introduced with Fig. 5 demonstrate the relationship between epidemic models and genealogies. Knowing the exact parameters and resulting dynamics throughout the simulated outbreak, we can build a full transmission history for the outbreak (which is not unique given only the time evolution of the number of infected individuals, since at each event the infected individuals involved are chosen randomly). An infection event in the forward simulation corresponds to a bifurcation in the transmission tree. Restricting the full tree to a \u201csample genealogy\u201d that only includes the individuals that were infectious at a specific sampling time yields very different results for different times during the outbreak, which underlines the importance of sampling methods (see e.g., Stack et al., 2010).",

This new field of phylodynamics encompasses both inference of classical epidemiological parameters using phylogenetics as well as exciting new approaches that aim to investigate the consequences of the inevitable interaction between evolutionary (mutation, drift, Darwinian selection) and ecological (population dynamics and ecological stochasticity) processes. The research being pursued has broader consequences for evolutionary biology and molecular ecology. This interaction of evolution and ecology will occur whenever a population contains genotypes with different intrinsic dynamical properties (e.g., virulence, transmission rates, recovery rates). Whereas this condition is almost always met in real populations and frequently definitive in its role in shaping outcomes, the mathematical and theoretically analysis of Darwinian selection within epidemiological models is the most challenging and least studied area within the emerging field of phylodynamics.
