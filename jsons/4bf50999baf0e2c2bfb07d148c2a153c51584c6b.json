To understand the signi\u00aecance of the 5 H leader RNA of PRRSV, we determined the complete leader sequences of \u00aefteen different North American strains of PRRSV and predicted their secondary structures. Viruses analysed included three reference strains and nine \u00aeeld strains originating from different geographic locations. To further examine the leader region, one of the \u00aeeld strains was adapted to grow in tissue culture, and three clones were isolated. We also predicted the secondary structures of two European strains based on their published sequences. The predicted RNA secondary structures of the leader sequences suggested the existence of three conserved domains formed by the 5 H region of the leader among the North American strains, two of which were conserved in the European strains. A variable structural domain was predicted from the 3 H region of the leader sequences of the North American strains, where all tissue culture-adapted isolates were characterized by a stem-loop while \u00aeeld isolates were characterized by an internal bulge within the stem-loop.",

After repeated passages, strain JK100 exhibited 10 8 pfu/ml virus titre and three cell culture-adapted clones exhibiting unique CPE morphology were isolated. The putative leader structure of JK100 and its clones maintained domain 1, 2 and 3, but not domain 4 (Fig. 3 ). JK100 exhibited a domain 4b structure and its tissue cultureadapted clones all exhibited a domain 4a structure, despite the different CPE morphologies. The structural switch from domain 4b (JK100) to domain 4a (JK100-1, JK100-2, JK100-3) suggests that the loss of the internal bulge within the stem-loop sub-domain of domain 4 corresponds with cell culture-adaptation. This is consistent with the other PRRSV leaders, which all \u00aeeld isolates poorly adapted to tissue culture either exhibited domain 4b or 4c, both of which posses a stem-loop sub-domain with an internal bulge. All cell culture-adapted and reference strains exhibit domain 4a, which lacks an internal bulge within the stem-loop sub-domain (Fig. 3 ).",

In this study, RNA secondary structure predictions revealed that the sequence divergence in the 5 H region of the leaders of the different PRRSV isolates was constrained to maintain the overall stability of three stem-loop structures (domains 1, 2 and 3). Putative RNA structures of European Lelystad and 111/92 PRRSV leaders revealed that two of these North American stem-loop structures (domains 2 and 3) are maintained in the European stains (results not shown). Structural conservation indicates that most nonconforming or non-compensatory mutational changes will not be tolerated and suggests functional roles for the 5 H region of the leaders of PRRSV will be maintained during evolution. The signi\u00aecance of secondary structures in viral leader sequences for initiation of mRNA translation has been well documented (11, 13, 33, 34) . In addition, many of these studies show that variations in leader structural elements essential for translation initiation result in viruses attenuation (11, 13, 14) . Experimental studies will be required to verify the RNA structures predicted for PRRSV leader RNAs and identify any functional roles in mRNA translation.",

Nevertheless, such RNA structural variation within the 3 H region of the leaders of PRRSV characterizes the cell culture-adapted isolates from the \u00aeeld isolates that are poorly tissue culture-adapted. The stability of domain 4 is altered, in that the internal bulge within the stemloop sub-domain is lost upon tissue culture-adaptation.
