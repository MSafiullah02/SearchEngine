            "text": "Bats provide important ecosystem services as pollinators, seed dispersers, and/or insect controllers, but they have also been found harboring different viruses with zoonotic potential. Virome studies in bats distributed in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America have increased dramatically over the past decade, whereas information on viruses infecting South American species is scarce. We explored the virome of Tadarida brasiliensis, an insectivorous New World bat species inhabiting a maternity colony in Rosario (Argentina), by a metagenomic approach. The analysis of five pooled oral/anal swab samples indicated the presence of 43 different taxonomic viral families infecting a wide range of hosts. By conventional nucleic acid detection techniques and/or bioinformatics approaches, the genomes of two novel viruses were completely covered clustering into the Papillomaviridae (Tadarida brasiliensis papillomavirus type 1, TbraPV1) and Genomoviridae (Tadarida brasiliensis gemykibivirus 1, TbGkyV1) families. TbraPV1 is the first papillomavirus type identified in this host and the prototype of a novel genus. TbGkyV1 is the first genomovirus reported in New World bats and constitutes a new species within the genus Gemykibivirus. Our findings extend the knowledge about oral/anal viromes of a South American bat species and contribute to understand the evolution and genetic diversity of the novel characterized viruses.",

Approximately 25% of the world's bat species are endangered, causing concerns about the negative conservation impact and its influence on the ecosystem services these bats provide, such as arthropod regulation, seed dispersal, and pollination [1, 3] . On the other hand, certain specific aspects of bats-including their relatively long lifespan in relation to their body size [4] , the reliance of some species on prolonged torpor [5] , and flight-may make them suitable for hosting a wide variety of viruses [6] , including zoonotic viruses highly pathogenic to humans [6] , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus [7] [8] [9] [10] . Nevertheless, little is known about their own pathogens [3] . In addition, the gregarious behavior of many bat species, such as free-tailed bats Tadarida brasiliensis (I. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1824), may facilitate rapid transmission of pathogens between bats and other species [6] . T. brasiliensis is the most abundant migratory and cosmopolitan species of the New World bats, widespread throughout the Americas [11] [12] [13] and protected by international agreements [14] .",

On the other hand, sequences related to viruses infecting plants (five viral families, 0.446% of viral read pairs, and 4.57% of viral contigs) were mostly associated with Phycodnaviridae or Potyviridae, whereas those related to viruses infecting protists (five viral families, 13.6% of viral read pairs, 0.654% of viral contigs) clustered predominantly in the family Mimiviridae. Sequences classified as originating from vertebrates, predominantly mammalian viruses, were represented by 7.07% of viral read pairs and 35.9% of viral contigs. The principal viral families identified included Retroviridae, Genomoviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, and Poxviridae. The analysis also identified (although in low counts) viral sequences related to the family Alloherpesviridae, which infects fish and amphibians. Of note, the metagenomic analysis indicated that 205 out of 461 read pairs were assigned to the family Retroviridae (1.48% of viral read pairs), and 22 assembled contigs (14.4% of viral contigs; Table 1 ) exhibited resemblance to the nucleotide sequence of Desmodus rotundus endogenous retrovirus isolate 824 (Genbank accession number: NC_027117) [56] . However, a more detailed analysis of this sequence revealed the presence of two flanking regions at the 5 and 3 ends of approximately 1000 nt, which probably derived from the host genome (Desmodus rotundus). In fact, contigs and reads previously classified as Retroviridae in our study aligned with these flanking regions.

The complete novel genome sequence was covered on average 252.6\u00d7 by a total of 6935 read pairs (13,870 reads) . Detailed analysis of the TbraPV1 viral genome (Table 2 and Figure 2A) , showed a typical genomic organization of bat PVs, potentially encoding four early genes (E6, E7, E1, and E2) and two late genes (L2 and L1) [57, 58] . A putative E4 gene was found overlapping the E2 gene ( Figure 2A) , with its own start and stop codons, and the presence of E4-characteristic proline-rich stretches (12.7%) with an important role in cell cycle arrest was found [59] . Typical domains were additionally identified in the putative viral proteins encoded by TbraPV1. The E6 protein contained two characteristic zinc-binding domains, separated by 36 amino acids [61] , and four internal and likely not functional PDZ-binding motifs (RTNV, ISDL, SSIL, LSSL) [62] . The E7 protein contained a pRB-binding motif (LWCDE) [63] and a single zinc-binding domain ( Table 2) . Analysis of the E1 protein, the largest protein encoded by TbraPV1 (Table 2) , showed the typical ATPbinding site of the ATP-dependent helicase (GPSNSGKS) [64] , and several Cdk-phosphorylation and The upstream regulatory region (URR) of TbraPV1 contained two typical TATA boxes, three putative E2 protein binding sites, an E1 protein binding site [60] , and three putative polyadenilation sites for late gene transcripts (Table 2) . Multiple potential binding sites for transcriptional regulatory factors, such as AP-1, NF-1, and SP-1, were also present within the URR (data not shown). Typical domains were additionally identified in the putative viral proteins encoded by TbraPV1. The E6 protein contained two characteristic zinc-binding domains, separated by 36 amino acids [61] , and four internal and likely not functional PDZ-binding motifs (RTNV, ISDL, SSIL, LSSL) [62] .

Analysis of the E1 protein, the largest protein encoded by TbraPV1 (Table 2) , showed the typical ATP-binding site of the ATP-dependent helicase (GPSNSGKS) [64] , and several Cdk-phosphorylation and Cyclin-binding sites. A highly conserved bipartite-like nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a leucine-rich Crm1-dependant nuclear export signal (NES) (LSPVLEKVTI), which together allow shuttling of the E1 protein between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm in most human PVs [65] [66] [67] , were identified at the N-termini of the E1 protein. No conserved leucine zipper domain was present at the C-termini of the putative TbraPV1 E2 protein, in agreement with other bat PVs (EsPV2 and RfPV1) [58] . At the N-termini of the L2 protein, a highly conserved furine cleavage motif (RRKR), as well as a transmembrane-like domain (GTGGGGRGVPIGPRVATGRPGGPINSVG) [68] , were identified.",

Remapping to the TbGkyV1 genome sequence indicated a mean coverage of 59.4\u00d7 by a total of 430 read pairs (860 paired reads + 7 unpaired reads) and did not reveal any abnormalities that would indicate misassembly. Completeness of the circular genome sequence was determined by matching 5 and 3 ends, and the sequence was rotated to begin with the characteristic Genomoviridae nonanucleotide motif [70] . Three non-overlapping ORFs, with a minimum protein length of 120 aa, were found, exhibiting peak amino acid similarities to the Genomoviridae Rep and CP/Cap proteins. The Rep protein of TbGkyV1 was encoded across two different Rep-encoding ORFs separated by an intron, representing a catalytic and a central protein domain ( Figure 2B , Table 3 ), which is characteristic for replication-associated proteins encoded by single-stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses [71] . Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise sequence comparison demonstrated that TbGkyV1 shares its highest identity in the Rep protein (77.5%) and the complete genome level (nucleotide sequence, 77.2%) with the \"Mongoose associated gemykibivirus 1\" (Genbank accession number KP263545) [70] ( Figures 3B and 6) .

Multiple sequence alignments were constructed using Muscle (v3.8.31) [47] , and the distance matrices were estimated using SeaView v4.7 [49] , as suggested in Bernard et al. (2010) . Red arrows indicate the maximum sequence similarities of TbraPV1 for each of the sequence contexts (E1, E2, L2, and L1 concatenation and the L1 gene sequence). The blue arrows (A1 and A2) indicate the overall maximum sequence identity in the depicted context (E1, E2, L2, and L1 concatenation and the L1 gene sequence). The histograms were visualized using gnuplot (v5).

The pairwise similarity matrices were obtained through pairwise sequence alignments (Muscle v3.8.31) [47] , using Sequence Demarcation Toolkit (SDT v1) [55] . For the arrows in the histogram: red = the species demarcation threshold/criteria (SDC) for Genomoviridae [70] ; green and blue = maximum pairwise identity values of TbGkyV1 for the complete genome (green) and the Rep protein sequence contexts (blue).

Nucleic sequence identity histograms of the 377 PV nucleotide sequences (A1 and A2) and TbraPV1 (A3 and A4) based on the concatenated E1, E2, L2, and L1 gene sequences (A1 and A3) and on the L1 gene sequence (A2 and A4). Multiple sequence alignments were constructed using Muscle (v3.8.31) [47] , and the distance matrices were estimated using SeaView v4.7 [49] , as suggested in Bernard et al. (2010) . Red arrows indicate the maximum sequence similarities of TbraPV1 for each of the sequence contexts (E1, E2, L2, and L1 concatenation and the L1 gene sequence). The blue arrows (A1 and A2) indicate the overall maximum sequence identity in the depicted context (E1, E2, L2, and L1 concatenation and the L1 gene sequence). The histograms were visualized using gnuplot (v5). (B) Pairwise sequence identity histograms based on 167 complete genome nucleotide (purple) and Rep gene (green) amino acid sequences from the Genomoviridae family, based on the entire pairwise identity distance matrices (B1) and on the matrix slices representing pairwise identities of TbGkyV1 to all other 166 Genomoviridae sequences (B2). The pairwise similarity matrices were obtained through pairwise sequence alignments (Muscle v3.8.31) [47] , using Sequence Demarcation Toolkit (SDT v1) [55] . For the arrows in the histogram: red = the species demarcation threshold/criteria (SDC) for Genomoviridae [70] ; green and blue = maximum pairwise identity values of TbGkyV1 for the complete genome (green) and the Rep protein sequence contexts (blue). Histograms were visualized using gnuplot (v5). nt = nucleotide, aa = amino acid, SCD = sequence demarcation threshold/criteria [70] . CG: complete genome. Figure 6 . Phylogenetic tree of the Genomovirus Rep amino acid sequence. The tree was constructed using the LG+I+G4 substitution model, and branches are annotated with Sh-aLRT (1000 replicates), aBayes, and UF bootstrap support (1000 replicates) values, respectively. Maximum support values are shown with asterisks (*). Novel TbGkyV1 is depicted in bold. Genomoviridae genera were classified according to Varsani and Krupovic (2017) . Unclassified sequences were not depicted. Table 3 and Figure 2B . The large intergenic region of the novel virus contains the characteristic nonanucleotide (TATAAATAG) motif, which is likely to be important for rolling-circle replication initiation [72] [73] [74] . The Rep protein's catalytic domain of TbGkyV1 contained rolling circle replication motif I (LFTYSQ), possibly involved in the recognition of iterative DNA sequences associated with the origin of replication [70] , motif II (THLHV), which may regulate the nicking/joining endonuclease activity at the origin of DNA replication [73, 75] , motif III (YATK), involved in the double-strand DNA cleavage [73, 76] , and a geminivirus Rep protein sequence (GRS) (RLFDVENFHPNIVPSR), which allows appropriate spatial arrangements of motifs II and III [77] . Furthermore, Rep helicase motifs Walker-A (GPSRTGKT), Walker-B (VFDDI), and Walker-C (WLMN) [78] [79] [80] [81] were identified in the central Rep protein domain. Walker motifs contribute to ATP binding, which is used as an energy source to unwind the dsDNA intermediate in the 3 -5 direction by the Rep helicase [80, 81] .",

            "text": "During our study a total of 6,738,566 read pairs were removed during the laboratory batchbackground screening, due to traces of sequences from co-processed samples. The power of NGS stems from non-specific sampling of nucleic acids and automated repetition, yielding vast numbers of sequencing reads, providing the opportunity to characterize populations of nucleic acids with unprecedented sensitivity, accuracy, and non-specificity. Due to its super-sensitivity, even the slightest addition of environmental nucleic acids to a sample may be detected using NGS and can potentially further complicate the interpretation of the results. Laboratory background and/or DNA isolation kit-derived contamination has been addressed previously as a major factor that can severely impede the interpretation of high throughput sequencing data, and the use of negative controls has been proposed [82] . Moreover, positive/negative control samples have been recommended in metagenomic experiments aimed at detecting pathogens in clinical samples [83] . In this study, the metagenomic sample was processed alongside six samples of molluscum contagiosum skin lesions, and laboratory background filtering was initially considered due to the detection of approximately 90 molluscum contagiosum virus read pairs in the trimmed read dataset. In order to prevent the identification of human skin microflora in the pooled bat swab sample, a strict k-mer based negative filtering was used, effectively removing any read pair that contained at least one 27 bp subsequence that could be identified in any of the read pairs from the six background datasets. Because the background samples also originated from mammalian (human) skin, it could be that a large portion of mammalian reads were removed during this step, explaining the somewhat extreme number of read pairs classified as laboratory-batch background. Moreover, it is also likely that the viral composition of human and bat skin could be shared to some degree, but due to the filtering scheme reads originating from bats' anal and oral microflora sharing nucleotide sequence similarity to that of human skin may have also been removed prior to metagenomic classification. As a consequence, taken strictly, only the subset of viruses that are present in T. brasiliensis, but not in human skin, was explored here. Although DNA spillovers could be suspected and controlled for to some degree, in this case it may be a greater challenge in studies where multiple samples from different species or anatomical sites of bats are processed. In light of the present results, it would likely be beneficial to process the samples in such studies as independently as possible and to include negative controls that would characterize the laboratory background, such as sequencing libraries of buffer solutions that underwent the same treatment as the samples, as suggested previously [84, 85] .",

Although the proportion (and number) of virus-related sequences detected in this study (<1%) is comparable to reports of previous studies of bat viromes based on Illumina sequencing [19, 21, 86] , it may be that additional physical viral DNA/RNA enrichment steps, such as centrifugation, filtration, and/or nuclease-treatment, could further augment the viral read yields, as suggested previously [87] . Initially, this study was focused on the identification of PVs in T. brasiliensis, in order to explore their diversity in different hosts. Accordingly, swab samples included in this work were first processed using experimental protocols, designed previously to suit our aforementioned initial aim [34] [35] [36] . Viral DNA was enriched using RCA, as suggested previously by others [40] [41] [42] . However, it should be noted that RCA may have favorably facilitated the amplification of circular genomes and, as a consequence, hindered the detection of linear genomes. Thus, more than 80% of the classified viral sequences (11,162/13,801) identified in our analysis corresponded to circular viral genomes.",

            "text": "According to the current ICTV Papillomaviridae classification guidelines (published in June 2018), based on the nucleotide sequence of the L1 gene [96] , TbraPV1 is the founding member of a novel PV genus in the Firstpapillomavirinae taxonomical subfamily, sharing more than 45% sequence identity to other PV types included in this subfamily. Although nucleotide sequences analysis in the L1 gene indicated that TbraPV1 shares a 61.5% identity with HPV41 (Nu-PV) and should be included within the same genus (more than 60% of nucleotide identity in L1 gene) [91] , the mentioned demarcation criteria suggests a visual inspection of phylogenetic trees derived from concatenated E1, E2, L1, and L2 nucleotide sequences to delineate PV genera [96] . In the present study, such analysis clustered TbraPV1 basal to the delineation of HPV41 (Nu-PV) and EdPV1 (Sigma-PV), identified in a North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) and, therefore, may represent a novel genus within the Papillomaviridae family. This phylogenetic clustering also indicated that TbraPV1 shares common ancestry with other bat PVs such as EsPV1, EsPV3, RfPV1, EhPV1, and MscPV2. On the other hand, TbraPV1 is only distantly related to RaPV1, EhPV2, EhPV3, EsPV2, MscPV1, and MrPV1, which have been identified from different tissues and bats species. The idea that different bat PVs evolved during a process of strict host coevolution is further refuted by the observation that different bat PVs appear scattered around the Papillomaviridae phylogenetic tree in a highly polyphyletic manner [57, 58] . In addition, under strict host coevolution it would be expected for TbraPV1 and MmoPV1, both molossid PVs, to be closely related; nevertheless, MmoPV1 has a basal taxonomic position with respect to TbraPV1. These observations support the idea of multiple evolutionary forces as drivers of PV evolution, including coevolution, adaptive radiation, broad host range, host switch, and recombination [58] .",

Members of this family encode two genes-the Cap/CP and the rolling-circle replication-associated protein (Rep)-and an intergenic region. It has been proposed that a novel viral complete genome sequence of the same species exhibits more than 78% similarity to any other complete genomovirus genome [70] . In addition, in previous studies, the authors aimed to establish nine genera within the family Genomoviridae based on pairwise comparisons of complete genome sequences [70] . CRESS DNA viruses, including genomoviruses, have been found in association with a great variety of animal species, such as camels [98] , bats [89] , mongooses, badgers [99] , wolves [100] , pigs [101] , and humans [102] , as well as in environmental-associated [103] and plant-associated [104] samples. However, no direct implication with a disease has been demonstrated so far. In particular, bat-associated genomoviruses have been identified from feces [105, 106] or pharyngeal and anal swab samples [89] of Asiatic [89, 105] or European [106] bat species and have been attributed to various taxonomic genera of the Genomoviridae family [70] . TbGkyV1 is a novel species within the Gemykibivirus genus according to the classification criteria [70] . It should be noted that the Rep and Cap proteins of TbGkyV1 exhibited different percentages of similarity, the Cap being considerably more divergent than the Rep, indicating differences in their evolutionary histories due to their respective molecular functions [70, 106] . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the presence of genomoviral sequences in mucosal swab samples of a New World bat species.",

In addition, identifying a sequence fragment that resembles a known viral genome in a given genomic region, may not always be sufficient to infer that that specific virus was present in the sample. Viruses are highly promiscuous entities, which can easily exchange parts of their genomes with their hosts, be integrated or even naturalized into the host genomes [107] . Taxonomical viral families identified among the assembled contigs could be interpreted as viral families that were probably represented in our samples. Lastly, and due to the low number of assembled contigs, that were found related to known viral sequences, we attempted to increase the sensitivity even further by obtaining taxonomical family mappings also for the source read pairs. These results, however, should be interpreted with utmost caution, because they likely confer a very low level of specificity due to the limited sequence length (2 \u00d7 150 bp). Taxonomical viral families identified by read-pair taxonomy mapping only, merely suggest the possibility that these families were present and should be replicated in the future by taxonomical mappings conferring greater specificity, for example with longer sequences, such as those assembled from Illumina or Nanopore reads.",
