Despite developments in research related to the grief and loss of foster parents, more research would be helpful in building a stronger understanding and knowledge base for helping foster parents manage the removals of foster children in their home. This study included ten foster parents from the United States and explored their experience with loss and the stress associated with the expected or unexpected removal of a foster child from their home. The findings of the data analysis yielded three overarching themes: (1) managing or coping with ambiguous loss; (2) systemic impacts of a move or removal on a family; (3) need for helpful preparation or support for dealing with the loss of foster child. Implications include better preparation and support for foster parents dealing with moves and removals of foster children, as well as considering less abrupt removals of children from foster homes.",

Children are removed from their home of their biological parent or primary caregiver when they experience significant abuse or neglect and it is deemed unsafe for children to remain in the home, and subsequently, they are placed in the home of a relative or nonrelative foster parent (see Children's Bureau, 2019 for a description of the multiple policies associated with administering the U.S. child welfare system). Nonrelative foster parents provide approximately 45% of the placements for foster children (USDHHS, 2014) ; thus, they should be a central focus of research. Foster parents are crucial to the function of the child welfare system; however, fostering is stressful (Adams, Hassett, & Lumsden, 2018) . Adams et al. (2018) identified that stressors tend to be both individual-level, such as managing child behavioral issues, as well as stressors that come from involvement with the child welfare system.",

            "text": "Despite the longstanding history of foster care in the United States, there are few contemporary studies that explore the impact of a foster child's removal on foster parents. Historically, foster parents have been expected to provide a safe physical environment, make a positive emotional investment in the foster child, and then be able to gracefully separate from the child once the child leaves the home, whether departure is abrupt or planned (Edelstein, 1981) . Older studies have identified that when a foster child does leave the foster home, which may be due to the child's reunification with the biological family, the placement of the child in another home, or the adoption of the child, foster parents may experience grief for several reasons (Edelstein, 1981; Edelstein, Burge, & Waterman, 2001) . However, Edelstein (1981) identified multiple barriers that appear to prevent or interfere with foster parents' ability to appropriately grieve the removal of the foster child: the demanding role of foster caring, characteristics of the foster parent's personality, and professional expectations of the foster agency or foster care system (Edelstein, 1981) . Some studies have indicated that personal or interpersonal challenges related to seeing a foster child leave the home were a primary reason foster parent planned to discontinue fostering (Buehler et al., 2003; Rhodes, Orme, & Buehler, 2001) . Foster parents usually have several children, both foster and biological, in the home and when one leaves, the demands of the others give them limited time to experience grief (Edelstein, 1981) . In addition, agencies may need to place another child in the home as soon as one other child leaves since there usually are a limited number of foster homes available for placement. Professional expectations often do not support parents getting attached to foster children, and when foster parents grieve, it is often labeled as a misunderstanding of their role (Edelstein, 1981) . Foster parents have also reported struggles in coping with the grief of other family members after the child leaves, such as the foster parents' biological children (Edelstein et al., 2001) . Despite this historical context, within the past decade there has been very limited research examining how foster parents experience loss and the stress associated with a foster child's removal from their home.",

Stress related to ambiguous loss and role ambiguity in foster parents has been a topic explored by other researchers (Hebert et al., 2013; Thompson & McArthur, 2009; Urquhart, 1989; Whiting & Huber, 2007) . However, more research, as well as more recent research, is needed to examine the unique experiences that foster parents have when dealing with the experience of a foster child being removed from their home. According to Whiting and Huber (2007) , foster parents may be hesitant to develop a closer relationship to a foster child because they recognize that a child would likely remain with them for only a short amount of time. Another study found that foster parents who had discontinued fostering reported they had less support from the agency and did not feel like they, as foster parents, were involved in the decision-making process when the child left (Urquhart, 1989) .",

For example, some foster parents experience the removal of a child due to an abuse allegation. Within this context, Thompson and McArthur (2009) found that foster parents exhibited ambiguity as they wondered whether the child would come back to the foster home again. Ambiguity also exists after children leave the foster home. Examples include foster parents ruminating over how their foster children are faring, and coming to recognize that they know nothing about their foster child's future (Hebert et al., 2013; Thompson & McArthur, 2009; Whiting & Huber, 2007) . Despite these initial attempts to document stress experiences, a more in-depth exploration of the experience and context of a foster child's removal from the home is needed.",

To ensure confidentiality, no others were present in the room besides the participant and the first author when the interview took place. Participants were given the opportunity to stop the interview at any time to ensure they did not feel coerced to participate. Due to the sensitive nature of the study, the interviewer ensured that participants had a copy of the consent form with the first author's contact information after each interview in case the participant needed any additional support following the interviews.

A priori codes were developed by the first author of this study using both previous literature and the data generated by the four research questions in this study. In order to confirm the codes were appropriate, the researcher then consulted with the second author of this study to code two transcribed interviews using the a priori codes. After codes were discussed, refined, and no true discrepancies were noted, the researcher then trained a graduate student how to code the data. The graduate student read an article and practiced coding with the researcher until it was clear the student could independently code. After the two independent coders finished analyzing the data, the researcher and graduate student crosschecked the data to determine that the same codes were derived independently. Although there were no discrepancies since the codes were already formulated, the coders identified points in the data that needed a more specific or descriptive codes. In these situations coders discussed the codes until a more refined resolution was agreed upon. The researcher used this coding process to develop themes that gave a textural description of the experiences reported by the sample (Creswell, 2009; Moustakas, 1994) .",

Boss (1999 Boss ( , 2006 has found that people who experience ambiguity related to physical loss often keep the family member psychologically present in their minds. According to family stress theory, when a person (e.g., a foster child) is physically absent the remaining family members (i.e., foster parents) might cope by continuing to focus on the psychological presence of the child in the household (Boss, 1999 (Boss, , 2006 .",

Foster parents reported that they needed their personal faith, emotional closure, and self-care opportunities to help them manage their stress. Consistent with previous research (Hebert et al., 2013) , several foster parents reported that faith in a higher power was an important factor in helping them manage their stress, especially related to the loss of a foster child through removal. This was one of the first studies to discuss how foster parents actively tried to obtain emotional closure.

Although the ten foster parents provided a rich narrative of their fostering experience, they may not be a representative sample of all foster parents who have experienced the removal of a foster child from their home. Because the sample was recruited from foster parent associations and foster and adoptive ministries, participants may be receiving extra support when compared to other foster parents. This support may have impacted their perceptions and responses. Additionally, the sample consisted mostly of Caucasian females who were married, thus the findings may not representative of foster parents of a different race or gender.",

Further research considerations include conducting a study that includes a larger sample of more diverse foster parents. For example, perhaps there are differences in the experience of loss when comparing foster parents who hope to adopt versus foster parents who only intend to provide foster care services. Quantitative research should also be done to explore potential risk or protective factors that mediate or moderate the relations between moves/removals and foster parent stress or grief, as well as consider the longitudinal impact of multiple moves or removals. For example, does it get easier to process a move or removal or does it contribute to greater increases in stress over time? Essentially, research should more thoroughly consider how moves and removals impact foster parents. Researchers should also conduct evaluation research on available trainings related to grief/loss to assess relevance and effectiveness as this is an underdeveloped area of study (Hebert & Kulkin, 2016) .",

The context of fostering is already both complex and stressful for foster parents. For example, research has identified that foster parents report similar levels of compassion fatigue as child welfare workers and those who report higher compassion fatigue also report lower fostering satisfaction and report being more likely to quit fostering (Hannah & Woolgar, 2018) . Thus, more substantial preparation for the challenges of fostering and managing of child removals may be helpful. Researchers have also identified that foster parents report only moderate engagement in self-care and this varies by gender, relationship status, health status, and current financial status (Miller, Cooley, Owens, & Fletcher, 2019) . One way that agencies can promote self-care is by encouraging and supporting foster parents in exploring other support systems like family, friends, or other foster parents when managing the loss of a foster child.",

Because of the stress and complexity of the child welfare system and the challenge of being a caseworker, this may be particularly difficult (Thompson, Wojciak, & Cooley, 2015) . If advanced communication is not possible, child welfare caseworkers may need to provide more consistent and repeated communication about the uncertainty of child cases in a sensitive manner, while also being open and understanding of foster parents' attachment to their foster children. Although foster parents receive preservice training to help prepare them for fostering and they should understand that the mission of the child welfare system is to return children to their parents, foster parents may need additional reminders and training to understand the importance of reunification, attachment between children and their biological parents, and the benefits of kinship care. Because foster parents may not have the same educational background or professional experiences as caseworkers (e.g., caseworkers function under the goal of reunification, adoption, or concurrent planning while foster parents function as substitute parents with daily attachment-oriented interactions with children), child welfare workers may need to be ready to show higher levels of empathy to foster families coping with a removal of a foster child. It is also important that agencies ensure ongoing access to support groups, counseling, and other appropriate resources for foster families who may struggle with the loss of their foster children.",

This study also identified that the removal of a foster child impacts not only other members in the household but other family and friends as well. Foster parents manage multiple stressors and responsibilities in their role within the foster care system and may need additional training or support. Agencies will likely need to create a context of openness and support to ensure foster parents' needs are appropriately met.",
