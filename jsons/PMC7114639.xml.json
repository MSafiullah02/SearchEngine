Therefore, EBM consists of integrating the best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values. It is based on two main principles, the application of the best available evidence from the scientific method to medical decision making [11] and the assessment of the quality of evidence of the advantages and disadvantages of treatments [12].",

And on the other, the quality ranking is slightly better in this study, 8.2% vs. 9.42%. However, the way it is obtained is quite different. Choi uses a Machine Learning algorithm that requires a prior training step. This step uses a collection like the Clinical Hedges Database, which is not always available or easily accessible. For that reason, an alternative method has been followed here. In this case interaction with the user is necessary, but this is not a problem because the user is necessarily waiting for the results of the search process. Hence, a clustering algorithm allows documents to be grouped according to conceptual criteria and the best to be chosen by the user.",
