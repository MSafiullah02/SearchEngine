Hematuria work-ups and bladder cancer (BCa) staging have been considered a priority because of the potential aggressive behavior of this disease. Evidence suggests that cancer patients are at higher risk of death from COVID-19 [1]. Thus, minimizing the potential exposure of this group by reducing hospital visits and admissions, postponing low-risk surgeries, and delaying or reconsidering intravenous therapies has to be factored into the risk/benefit discussion for BCa patients.",

In addition, the VI-RADS score is designed to provide locoregional staging and to predict the likelihood of organ-confined versus locally invasive disease. Consequently, applying VI-RADS at the time of presentation with gross hematuria may aid urologists in minimizing elective procedures and obtaining a radiation-free the evaluation of both T and N staging from a single examination, while providing a prognostic criterion for adjusting oncologic class priority among overwhelmed waiting lists (Fig. 1\nA).",

This may be particularly useful in cases lacking muscularis propria in the specimen or in the setting of a unifocal, small, high-grade Ta/T1 tumor, for which a preoperative VI-RADS score of 1\u20132 may indicate a low likelihood of tumor understaging and therefore patients may be quickly directed to appropriate adjuvant intravesical therapy for follow-up. This relatively safe approach might minimize potential exposure to COVID-19 infection by avoiding a second hospital admission for a surgical procedure that is not devoid of possible complications (Fig. 1B).",

The final treatment decision will need to take into account several factors, including the evolution of the pandemic, local health system capacity, and the overall performance status of the patient. Detection of a VI-RADS score of 5 might aid in identifying cases with high-volume disease and advanced stage who could benefit most from early neoadjuvant therapy. Conversely, patients with a VI-RADS score of <5 could proceed directly to RC and avoid the risk of exposure associated with neoadjuvant regimens (Fig. 1C).",
