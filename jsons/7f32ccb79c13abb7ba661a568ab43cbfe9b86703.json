To stop the spread of COVID-19 from the early epicenter-Wuhan, China unprecedentedly locked down the entire city of Wuhan on January 23. It was shown that the Wuhan lockdown delayed the occurrence of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days and may have prevented more than 700,000 COVID-19 cases outside of Wuhan [8] . This massive lockdown was then later served as a model for several other countries battling COVID-19 around the world. Currently the development of vaccines is still in progress and there are no effective antiviral drugs for treating COVID-19 infections. The only practical therapeutic option is hospitalization and intensive care unit management. Thus predicting the peak time (or turning point), the duration and the final size of the outbreak for each country becomes crucial for policy makers and public health authorities to have informed decisions on appropriate interventions and resource allocations. However, since the COVID-19 virus is a novel coronavirus, key infection parameters such as the mean incubation period and the mean infection period are not known. This, together with the complex contact patterns, makes predictions based on previously established compartmental models for other viruses very challenging.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 200, "end": 212, "text": "[3-7, 9, 10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 526, "end": 529, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this study, we simply regarded the daily new cases as a function of time t and coupled a power law with an exponential law.

By fitting the available daily new cases data to our model, we were able to identify the peak time of daily increased new cases, predict the duration, the final size and the attack rate of the outbreak for each country.
