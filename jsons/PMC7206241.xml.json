In data streams, the underlying data distribution may change over time, causing decay in the predictive ability of the machine learning models. This phenomenon is known as concept drift. For example, in a weather prediction model when there is a shift from one season to another, one may observe a decrease in prediction accuracy.",

If a concept reappears, for example a particular weather pattern, previously learnt classifiers can be reused; thus the performance of the learning algorithm can be improved. Current techniques that deal with recurrent concept drifts [2, 7] are exact methods, relying on meta-information. A drawback of these techniques is their approach to memory management in storing the classifier pool. These methods create a new classifier after each drift, which leads to a large pool of concepts being created early in the process. This makes identifying previously seen concepts or states more expensive.",

We use an extended Adaptive Random Forest (ARF) as the base classifier [6]. Like ARF, it contains a set of foreground trees, each with a drift detector to track warnings and drifts, and a set of background trees that are created and trained when drift warnings are detected. Beyond that, we keep all the drifted foreground trees in an online tree repository and maintain a set of candidate trees. The candidate trees are a small subset of the online tree repository, which can potentially replace the drifted trees. When the drift warning is detected, a set of candidate trees are selected from this online tree repository by either the State Pattern Matching technique or the Tree Transition Graph. Once the actual drift is detected, the foreground trees are replaced by either their background trees or the more relevant candidate trees. In addition, we periodically update the Tree Transition Graph using a Lossy Counting [8] approximation. The benefit of Lossy Counting is the ability to control the size of the graph and expire less frequently used trees, thus adapting the graph to the dynamic environment of the evolving data.",

            "text": "There has been some research using probabilistic methods for concept drift adaptation to find recurrent patterns. RePro [14] was proposed to predict concept models for future drifts using historical trends of concept change. The authors use a Markov Chain to model the concept history and have shown that this allows the learner to adjust more quickly to concept change in streams with recurring concepts. Chen et al. [4] proposed a novel drift prediction algorithm to predict the location of future drift points based on historical drift trends which they model as transitions between stream volatility patterns. The method uses a probabilistic network to learn drift trends and is independent of the drift detection technique. ProChange [9] finds both real and virtual drifts in unlabelled transactional data streams using the Hellinger distance, and models the volatility of drifts using a probabilistic network to predict the location of future drifts. The GraphPool framework [1] refines the pool of concepts by applying a merging mechanism whenever necessary by considering the correlation among features. Then, they compare the current batch representation to the concept representations in the pool using a statistical multivariate likelihood test. All of these techniques use an exact mechanism for managing the number of transitions from one model to another, which is computationally expensive.",

In ARF, there are two types of trees, namely the foreground trees and the background trees. The foreground trees get trained, and make individual predictions. The majority of the individual predictions forge the final prediction output of the ARF (i.e. voting). Additionally, each foreground tree is equipped with two drift detectors, one for detecting drift warnings and the other for detecting actual drifts. The background trees are created and start training from the root when the foreground trees have detected drift warnings. When actual drifts are detected, the background trees then replace the drifted foreground trees. The background trees do not participate in voting until they replace the drifted foreground trees.",

Besides, the drift warning period may be too short for the background trees to model the recurred concept. In contrast to ARF, PEARL stores drifted foreground trees in an online tree repository, and tries to reuse these trees to replace the drifted foreground trees when concepts recur. However, as the size of the repository can grow as large as the memory allows, it is computationally expensive to evaluate all the repository trees, to find relevant trees to the potentially recurring concepts. As a result, PEARL introduces a third type of tree, called the candidate trees, to the random forest. The candidate trees are a small subset of the repository trees. They are potentially the most relevant trees to the next recurring concept drift. Similar to the background trees, the candidate trees may replace the drifted foreground trees, and they do not participate in voting until such replacements happen.",

Initially, the state matching process finds candidate trees by matching patterns stored in a State Pattern Buffer. Each of the patterns represents a set of trees in the online repository, that co-occurred in predictions in the past. Meanwhile, PEARL constructs a probabilistic graphical model that captures the tree replacements when drifts are detected, as shown in the Update Phase in Fig. 1. When the graph model becomes stable, i.e., when the reuse rate of candidate trees surpasses a user set threshold, the state matching process is replaced by the tree transition process to find potential candidate trees. Conversely, when the graph model becomes unstable, PEARL switches back to the state matching process. Details of the two processes are presented in Sects. 4 and 5.",

In this case, before Lossy Counting was triggered, both the Tree Transition Graph only and the Tree Transition Graph with Lossy Counting configurations show a dip in accuracy. This is due to undesired graph transitions, and these undesired transitions happen more frequently when there are too many similar outgoing neighbours. However after an execution of Lossy Counting, the graph with Lossy Counting recovers faster than the graph only configuration. During this recovery period, the pattern matching process was triggered for the Tree Transition Graph with Lossy Counting because some nodes were isolated after the Lossy Counting removed rarely used outgoing neighbours. After that, the graph with Lossy Counting configuration starts to utilize the Tree Transition Graph, and it continues to outperform the Tree Transition Graph only configuration. Intuitively, there are two factors which contribute to such performance: firstly, the brief pattern matching activation after the Lossy Counting helps with the graph construction, which strengthens the stability of the graph; secondly, confusing similar outgoing neighbours were removed by Lossy Counting. Figure 4 captures the accuracy gain of the three types of configurations of PEARL against ARF. All configurations show a continuous gain in accuracy, but the graph with Lossy Counting tends to gain the most accuracy over time.",
