            "text": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a complex hormone system and classically known as a regulator of blood pressure. It is also recognized recently as a pro-inflammatory mediator [1]. In addition to systemic RAS, tissue intrinsic RAS has been identified in various tissues including the retina. The malfunction of tissue intrinsic RAS is involved in the pathogenesis of vascular [2], pulmonary [3] and ocular diseases [4]. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a vital molecular regulator of RAS. It is generated through sequential enzymatic catalysis by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from angiotensinogen. Ang II has two receptors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and AT2R. It has been proved that Ang II plays the deleterious roles through its receptor AT1R. Several studies demonstrated that the harmful axis of RAS, i.e., the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis was involved in several retinal diseases [4, 5]. Therapeutic intervention targeted to this axis showed remarkable protective effects. AT1R blocker (ARB) suppressed retinal neural dysfunction and downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in animal models of acute retinal inflammation [6]. In addition, oral administration of ARB prevented the progression of diabetic retinopathy by attenuating infiltration of leukocytes in the retina and delays the development of diabetic retinopathy [7].",

ACE2 decreases the generation of Ang II by catalyzing the conversion of Ang II to angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], which inhibits the vasoconstrictive, inflammatory, and oxidation stress effects of Ang II [8, 9]. Studies show that the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis is the protective axis of RAS [9]. This axis presents a broad range of beneficial effects including improving pathological conditions such as inflammation and fibrosis [10]. In fact, recombinant ACE2 effectively decreases the cell apoptosis rate and inflammatory cytokines protein levels on LPS-induced pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) by inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathways [11]. Existing evidence considers that increased expression of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) via adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene delivery in the retina diminishes diabetes-induced retinal inflammation and vascular pathology [12]. These studies propose an idea that enhancing the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis may be a promising approach for retinal inflammatory diseases.",

It has been suggested that DIZE reduces serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines by directly altering the production of these cytokines in macrophages [15], and exerts anti-inflammation effects under many inflammatory pathological processes including myocardia ischemia [13], pulmonary hypertension [16], and endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) [14, 17].

The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates the transport of nutrients and waste products from the retina, and contributes to outer segment renewal by ingesting and degrading the spent debris of photoreceptor outer segments [18]. Thus, RPE plays crucial roles in maintaining normal retinal function [19]. Dysfunction of RPE cells is involved in many inflammatory blind-causing ocular diseases, including age-related macular disease (AMD) [20]. Oxidative stress, lipofuscin accumulation in RPE cells are well-known pathological features of AMD [21]. In addition, inflammation of RPE exacerbates AMD because infiltrating macrophages promote choroidal neovascularization (CNV) [22]. We used primary cultured human RPE isolated from the donor eyes and a human RPE-derived cell line ARPE-19, which has similar structural and functional characteristics of RPE [23] in this study.",

The mRNA and protein expression of the inflammatory cytokines was determined by real-time PCR and ELISA assay. The levels of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 in the cells exposed to LPS were significantly higher than the control group.

However, ACE2 could cleave Ang II to generate Ang-(1-7), which is a member of the protective axis of RAS: ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas. To investigate whether the protective role of DIZE is mediated by activating ACE2 and by switching Ang II to Ang-(1-7), we detected the expression of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) by ELISA. DIZE significantly reduced the Ang II level compared with the LPS-treated ARPE-19 cells and hRPE. While ACE2-siRNA and A779 reversed the inhibition effect of DIZE (Fig. 7a). On the contrary, DIZE resulted in dramatically increase of Ang-(1-7) compared with the LPS treated ARPE-19 cells and hRPE. Whereas ACE2-siRNA and A779 reversed the effect of DIZE (Fig. 7b). The protein fold changes of Ang II and Ang-(1-7) were shown in Table 3. Moreover, studies have shown that AT1R increases in response to the inflammation stimuli. AT2R might display a counteraction role of AT1R. Thus, we investigated the effect of ACE2 on the expression of AT1R and AT2R. LPS treatment significantly increased the expression of AT1R, while DIZE reduced it. ACE2-siRNA abolished the inhibition effect of DIZE. It increased AT1R compared with DIZE+LPS group in both ARPE-19 cells (Fig. 8a) and hRPE (Fig. 8b). However, A779 did not abrogate the effect of DIZE on the expression of AT1R. Furthermore, there was no significance of AT2R expression in each group (Fig. 8a, b).",

We showed that DIZE reduced the overexpression of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 in response to LPS stimulation, and the effect is associated with the activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis. DIZE treatment also decreased the expression of Ang II, AT1R but increased Ang-(1-7). Meanwhile, we found that the MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways were involved in the LPS-induced overproduction of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. Whereas, pre-treatment with DIZE downregulated phosphorylation of p38MAPK, JNK, ERK1/2 and inhibited NF-\u03baB pathway. On the other hand, the ACE2-siRNA and an Ang-(1-7) antagonist reversed the protective effect of DIZE. Taking together, we suggest that the protective effects of DIZE on LPS-induced inflammatory response were mediated by activating the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis and by inhibiting the MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways.",

            "text": "RAS is considered traditionally a blood-pressure-regulating system. Whereas, increasing evidence suggests that it is also important in regulating inflammatory responses. Hyperactivation of the ocular intrinsic RAS contributes to an upregulation of ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and a downregulation of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis. It has been proposed to be critical in the development of various vision-threatening diseases [4], such as diabetic retinopathy, AMD, and uveitis. Ang II, the main effector molecule of RAS, contributes to the inflammatory process by increasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, and reactive oxygen species through the AT1R [40]. There is a direct evidence that abnormal production of Ang II in RPE would lead to retinal dysfunction and breakdown of blood-retinal barrier [41]. Ang II was capable of weakening the tight junction of blood-retinal barrier and increasing invasion of the choroidal endothelial cells [42]. On the other hand, AT1R blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease the expression of inflammatory cytokines and suppress ocular inflammation [43] as well as vascular inflammation [44]. Recent studies have shown that ACE2 acts as a counter-regulator of ACE in modulating the production of Ang-(1-7) [8, 9]. The ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis negatively regulates leukocyte migration and cytokine release and consequently inhibits inflammatory responses [45]. Overexpression of ACE2 reversed the imbalance of ACE2/ACE, reduced Ang II but increased Ang-(1-7) levels, suppressed secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in LPS-stimulated PMVECs [11]. Moreover, ACE2 deletion and Mas receptor inhibition exhibited parallel deleterious effects on LPS-induced damage and cytokine secretion by offsetting the protective effect of ACE2 overexpression [11]. Thus, we proposed that activating ACE2 could exert protection against LPS-induced ocular inflammation.",

Furthermore, ACE2-siRNA and A779 reversed these effects. Nevertheless, A779 did not affect the expression of AT1R after DIZE treatment in LPS group. A possible explanation is A779 is the antagonist of Ang-(1-7). It blocks the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis, but cannot reduce the expression of ACE2. ACE2 is capable to convert Ang II to Ang-(1-7), thus decrease Ang II and ultimately reduce the expression of AT1R. However, the mRNA expression of AT2R was not affected by any of the treatments. There might be two possibilities. On the one hand, there are large amount of AT2R expressed in the embryonic tissue, but the expression is less in the adult tissues. Either the LPS stimulation will not cause dramatically changes of AT2R expression, or it may not be involved in the LPS-induced response in RPE cells. On the other hand, there is evidence showing when AT1R is blocked, circulating Ang II binds, and activates AT2R only [46]. When the cells are exposed to LPS, Ang II is increased and binds to AT1R, thus the AT2R will not be bound or activated. It is in accordance with our results that the mRNA expression of AT2R was comparable in cells treated with LPS and in untreated cells. In cells treated with DIZE followed by LPS, ACE2 was increased and it could reduce the expression of Ang II, so AT2R was not activated.",

LPS initiated the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by activating the MAPK and NF-\u03baB cascades [48].

A possible underlying mechanism that ACE2 exerts its anti-inflammatory effect is by blocking the activation of p38MAPK and JNK [11]. It has been shown that DIZE dramatically suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines after LPS treatment by downregulating the phosphorylation of MAPKs (p38MAPK, JNK, ERK), STATs, and NF-\u03baB, which were the key signaling molecules and transcription factors involved in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in immune cells [33].",

External stimuli activate NF-\u03baB transcription, lead to the phosphorylation of I\u03baB-\u03b1, and increase the degradation of I\u03baB by proteosome [49]. NF-\u03baB is activated and translocated into the nucleus to upregulate the transcription of several inflammatory genes. Many in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that activation of NF-\u03baB is the key link in regulating the LPS-induced inflammatory response [39, 50]. Inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokines production in LPS-induced uveitis and in RPE cells [51]. Here, we confirmed that LPS increased the activation of NF-\u03baB in RPE cells, and the specific inhibitor of NF-\u03baB significantly decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokines generation. Our results proved that the NF-\u03baB signaling was involved in LPS-induced inflammatory response in ARPE-19 cells.
