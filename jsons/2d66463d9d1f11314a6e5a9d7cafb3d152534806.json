            "text": "Rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza or respiratory syncytial virus not only provoke upper respiratory tract infections (URI) but also can precipitate asthma in adults and children, many of whom also manifest allergic respiratory disease. It has been postulated that patients with allergic rhinitis experience more pronounced symptoms and pathophysiology during URI than individuals without allergy. These observations have provided limited insight into the pathogenesis of URI in allergic patients. To better define these relationships several groups of investigators have examined the effect of experimental virus infection on volunteers with and without allergic rhinitis and with and without asthma. Lemanski et al. showed that Rhinovirus 16 (RV16) was able to modify bronchial hyperreactivity and late phase allergic asthmatic reactions. Calhoun et al. demonstrated that RV16 potentiated airway inflammation after segmental allergen bronchoprovocation in allergic subjects. Experimental RV16 infection also provoked a modest increase in histamine responsiveness accompanied by a modest increase in bronchial and intranasal lymphocytes and eosinophils. Yet, experimental RV16 infection did not trigger asthma or changes in spirometry or changes in bronchial reactivity to histamine or bradykinin in normal subjects. Studies in our laboratories using experimental Rhinovirus 39 (RV39) infection did not alter pulmonary measurements or methacholine responses in normal healthy allergic subjects. These results were surprising, as enhanced WBC histamine release was observed in the same RV39-infected allergic subjects and was similar to that observed in RV16 infection described by others. The RV39infected allergic subjects also showed acute increases in serum IgE as well as changes of cellular immune parameters. Bardin et al. described more severe nasal symptoms as well as increased nasal albumin in allergic rhinitis subjects experimentally infected with RV16. However, allergic subjects infected with RV39 did not show a physiologic hyper-responsiveness during a nonallergy season. Analysis of nasal secretions during RV39 infection did show more vascular permeability in allergic subjects. Experimental infection with RV39 and Influenza A has provoked eustachian tube obstruction, otitis media and rarely acute otitis. These studies of volunteers experimentally infected with virus suggest that atopy alone does not predispose to more severe symptoms but combining URI with allergen exposure enhanced allergen-induced inflammation. Recent studies implicate cytokines as participants in these virus-provoked responses. Increases in nasal lavage concentrations of IL-6 were found during experimental URIs caused by RV39, Influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus and coincide with peaks in symptomatology and pathophysiology. Moreover, IL-6 applied directly to the nasal mucosa in noninfected allergic subjects reproduced symptoms of rhinitis. Other studies have shown that IL-10 secretion from peripheral blood white cells was impaired in allergic subjects after experimental infection with Influenza A. It is anticipated that future studies using natural infection as well as experimental virus infection model will further define the mechanisms and relationships of virus infection to allergy and asthma.",

Additional studies comparing patients with and without allergic rhinitis demonstrated that the lower airway response to histamine broncho-provocation was significantly different in allergic rhinitis subjects [17] . As shown in Fig. 3 , there was also a positive correlation between the initial FEV 1 and the response to histamine provocation, indicating that the RV16 infection tended to increase the response to histamine provocation in those allergic rhinitis subjects with lower baseline FEV 1 . Fraenkel and colleagues experimentally infected allergics and normals and showed that RV16 increased histamine responsiveness in those with allergic asthma, but the changes were moderate [18] . Similar observations were seen in another study by the same group with airway hyperresponsiveness selectively enhanced in the allergic subjects but not in the nonallergic subjects [19] . However, not all studies using experimental RV infection have shown consistent effects in airway hyperresponsiveness. Skoner and coworkers in our laboratories studied methacholine airway hyperresponsiveness in 31 subjects with allergic rhinitis and 27 normal controls experimentally infected with RV39 and found no effect of RV infection on the bronchial response to methacholine.

These four subjects who developed histamine hyperresponsiveness during RV infection also had some decrease in FEV 1 , which might have some clinical significance. In another study this time using experimental RV2 infection Summers and colleagues found no changes in airway hyperresponsiveness to either histamine or bradykinin regardless of their allergic status [22] . Additional studies by Fleming et al. of RV16 experimental infection in healthy and asthmatic subjects also showed the severity of cold symptoms and the relative changes in pulmonary function to be similar in both groups, with only small increases in asthmatic symptoms and no increase in the use of bronchodilators [23] .",

            "text": "Summary Viral respiratory infections have major impacts on upper respiratory function as well as lower respiratory function in patients of all ages. These viral illnesses, which are often mild and only an inconvenience to many normal individuals, can also influence the subsequent development of allergy and asthma exacerbations with a major influence on these patient's well-being and their health status. Lower airway infection with respiratory syncytial virus increases the risk of asthma during the first decade of life, especially in those infants who have a genetic allergic predisposition. Yet, overall, the respiratory infection burden, the so-called hygiene hypothesis', as a whole is probably protective against the development of asthma. However, once asthma has developed, respiratory viruses precipitate many of the asthma exacerbations seen in both children and adults. Rhinovirus is the most common viral cause of upper respiratory and lower respiratory tract infections in older children and adults. Because allergy increases the risk of wheezing during a viral respiratory tract infection, our group of investigators as well as other investigators have focused on the interactions between allergic inflammation and experimental viral infection to understand the pathogenesis of these allergic and asthmatic exacerbations. In this review article I have discussed studies of experimental RV infection in both allergic and nonallergic humans. Allergen challenge during an experimental RV infection enhances the allergic and asthmatic inflammatory responses as reported by Lemanski and coworkers, who showed that the combination of allergen and RV in allergic subjects will enhance lower airway`asthmatic-like' pathophysiology [14] . Skoner et al. showed that allergic IgE responses were potentiated by experimental RV infection in subjects with allergic rhinitis even though significant increases of nasal symptoms were not seen [8] . In spite of these observations, experimental RV infections in allergic and nonallergic subjects causes far less of both upper and lower airway disease than clinicians would have anticipated based on the frequency that RV causes significant asthmatic exacerbations. Although the precise mechanism by which respiratory viruses such as RV cause symptoms is not known, there is evidence that the host immune response to the virus but not the virus itself plays a major role in symptoms pathogenesis. Viral replication in the epithelium of the airway triggers intracellular signalling pathways leading to increases in the local secretion of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. It appears that there may be increases in various cytokines during viral infection that can potentially recruit and activate those aspects of inflammation that are linked to the expression of allergy or asthma. It is anticipated that future studies in these aspects of viral and allergic inflammation will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis and asthma.",
