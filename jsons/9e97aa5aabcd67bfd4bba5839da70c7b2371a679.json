This begs the question: is substance abuse research relevant during a recession? Over the past three decades, researchers have tackled the question of how economic recessions impact substance use. In fact, the evidence shows that problematic substance use tends to increase during recessions, leading to higher incidence and relapse rates of substance use disorders (Nagelhout et al., 2017) . If anything, substance abuse research becomes more relevant during a recession, to care for these additional cases.",

Several lines of research have linked viral infections in various life stages to psychotic psychopathology. Although retrospective epidemiological research is challenging and often contested, many studies have reported that viral infections during pregnancy increase the risk of schizophrenia (K\u0119pi\u0144ska et al., 2020) . Similarly, viral infections in childhood appear to increase the risk of psychotic disorders in adulthood (Khandaker et al., 2012) . Finally, psychoneuroimmunological analyses of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, neural function, and brain tissue suggest that the progression of psychotic disorders in adults may be accompanied by abnormal peripheral and brain immune responses (De Picker et al., 2017) . Viral infection and immune responses may impact psychotic disorders by multiple pathways in utero, in childhood, and in adulthood.",
