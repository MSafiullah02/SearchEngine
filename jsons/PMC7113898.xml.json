            "text": "Pathogenic microorganisms may occur in high concentrations in the air inside the livestock houses. Along with ventilation, they can be emitted to the ambient environment and pose airborne infection risk to healthy animals on other farms and to humans living in the vicinity (Seedorf et al., 1998). The extent to which pathogenic microorganisms are transmitted to nearby recipients and cause disease spreading through the airborne route remains largely unclear. Actually, airborne transmission only has been considered as a possible route in historical disease outbreaks in livestock production when the outbreaks could not be attributed to other known routes such as direct contact transmission or fecal-oral transmission (Elbers et al., 2001; Gloster et al., 2003). Attempts to link pathogen transmission (between farms) to prevalent wind directions\u2014an apparent epidemiological proof of airborne transmission\u2014have not been always successful, and the transmission is assumed to only be favored at picky atmospheric conditions (Gloster et al., 2003; Mikkelsen et al., 2003). All these facts induce doubts on the importance of the role of airborne transmission in disease outbreaks; however, no one can conclusively exclude this transmission route due to its potentially extensive and intensive impacts if truly involved in epidemics.",

Here we define airborne transmission in livestock production as \u201can entire transmission process that involves pathogenic microorganisms releasing from the infected animal's excrement or secretion to air, transporting air, inhaled by a healthy animal, and eventually infecting the recipient.\u201d The airborne transmission of certain pathogenic microorganisms from animal to animal has been demonstrated in lab-scale experiments in which healthy animals separated physically but not aerially from infected animals became infected (Berthelot-Herault et al., 2001; Brockmeier and Lager, 2002). Furthermore, some microorganisms collected kilometers away from the source farm were found to be capable of infecting healthy animals intramuscularly or intratracheally (Otake et al., 2010). However, there is still uncertainty, because of the incomplete knowledge about the entire process of airborne transmission of microorganisms, from generation and transportation through inhalation and finally to infection (Stark, 1999).",

In 1987, the importance of the relationship between airborne microorganisms and dust from livestock production systems was reviewed by Muller and Wieser (1987). The authors separately described the indoor properties (source, concentration, and constitute) of airborne microorganisms and dust, and the dispersion in ambient air outdoors. Since then, much research has been done on specific processes involved in the transmission of the airborne microorganisms and dust. However, we lack an integrated overview of and insight into all the processes involved in the airborne transmission of microorganisms in association with dust.",

In section 3, the physical and biological decay of airborne microorganisms and dust during transmission is described. In section 4, the deposition of airborne microorganisms and dust in respiratory tracts, and the infective dose of pathogenic microorganisms to animals are introduced.

            "text": "Animals shed microorganisms mainly by means of fecal excretion, which may contain large amount of microorganisms (Letellier et al., 1999; Pell, 1997). Consider two common zoonotic bacterial species, Salmonella and Escherichia, both have been found in feces: Salmonella at a concentration of 2\u20137 log CFU g\u22121 feces (Gray and Fedorka-Cray, 2001; Himathongkham et al., 1999) and E. coli at 2\u20136 log CFU g\u22121 feces (McGee et al., 2001; Omisakin et al., 2003). Feces are also an important pathway for virus shedding from infected animals (Fouchier et al., 2003). A list of viral species that may be excreted by cattle was proposed by Pell (1997), including infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus. Many other viruses have been recovered from feces of other animal species, such as avian influenza A virus (Webster et al., 1978) and Newcastle disease virus (Spradbrow et al., 1988) in poultry, and swine fever virus (Van Oirschot, 1979), hepatitis E virus (de Deus et al., 2007), and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Yoon et al., 1993) in pigs. The microorganisms in feces can become airborne when dried fecal particles are disturbed by air flow or animal activity. Some studies have managed to identify feces as the source of airborne microorganisms. A study by Duan et al. (2009) found the airborne E. coli strains inside and downwind from the pig houses were closely associated with those isolated from pig feces. Water content binds particles in feces and prevents their suspension, so, the microorganisms in dry feces that have low water content become airborne more easily than microorganisms in fresh feces. The water content of fresh feces (or manure, when urine is not separated) is the range of 60\u201390% (Derikx et al., 1994), depending on the animal species. Under typical livestock housing environmental conditions, it may take hours or days to dry the feces to a water content less than 20%\u2014the water content of airborne dust in livestock production systems (Aarnink et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2013). This means the microorganisms must undergo a latent period between the moment they are excreted in the feces and the moment they become airborne.",

            "text": "During inhalation and exhalation the surface of the mucus in the respiratory tract is destabilized through an interplay between surface tension and viscous forces (Edwards et al., 2004). This can result in mucus's microorganisms to become airborne and expelled from the body via breathing, coughing, and sneezing. This source of airborne microorganisms is widely accepted in the human model of disease transmission, and pathogenic microorganisms have been frequently recovered from the exhaled aerosols (Fabian et al., 2008; Weber and Stilianakis, 2008). Only a few studies have been carried out to directly detect the microorganisms in exhaled air of animals. By sampling exhaled air in masks placed over the heads of infected pigs, Cho et al. (2006) recovered PRRSV and Hermann et al. (2008) recovered Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Bordetella bronchiseptica. In contrast, Hermann et al. (2008) failed in recovering PRRSV, Porcine circovirus 2, swine influenza virus, and Porcine respiratory coronavirus in the exhaled air of infected pigs, although they were found in the oral and nasal swabs. Similarly, Zhao et al. (2013) could not recover infectious brusal disease virus in the exhaled air of infected broilers. These results indicate that some microorganisms in animal respiratory tracts might not readily become suspended in the air or be expelled out of the body, which implies that this is perhaps not an major source of airborne microorganisms as compared to animal feces (Zhao et al., 2013). However, the reason the microorganisms may not be detected could be because the quantities of exhaled microorganisms were below the detection limit of the sampling devices. Therefore, animal respiratory tracts can only be excluded as a source of airborne microorganisms until it has been incontrovertibly established that every single microorganism is detectable.",

The microorganisms may originate from the soil and are transferred to standing crops by wind, rain, mechanical agitation, or insects (Maciorowski et al., 2007). Both nonpathogenic and pathogenic microorganisms have been recovered from feed; analysis has revealed concentrations of Gram-negative bacteria in feed as high as 5 log CFU g\u22121 (Hofacre et al., 2001). These microorganisms can be disseminated together with feed particles during feeding (Andersson et al., 1999; Chang et al., 2001); the extent of dissemination depends greatly on how the feed is given (e.g., dry vs. wet feed delivery and powder vs. pellet feed delivery; Pearson and Sharples, 1995).",

            "text": "Litter is a mixture of bedding materials (e.g., wood shavings, chopped straw, sawdust, and rice hulls) animal feces, dander, and feed (Torok et al., 2009). The provision of litter in livestock production systems may improve animal welfare by increasing the incidence of natural behaviors (Appleby and Hughes, 1991), which, however, may result in more microorganisms being present in the air than in housing systems without litter (Madelin and Wathes, 1989; Vucemilo et al., 2007). The microorganisms arrive in litter during the harvesting and processing of the bedding material, and through animal excretion and secretion. The concentrations of aerobic bacteria in poultry litter range from 3 to 9 log CFU g\u22121 (Lu et al., 2003; Martin et al., 1998). Most of the bacteria in the poultry litter are Gram-positive. Gram-negative bacteria and mold account for a small fraction of the total microbial count, but due to the high concentration of the total microorganisms, their numbers can still be high in some cases (Martin et al., 1998). Surprisingly, some pathogenic bacteria that are commonly recovered from animal feces (e.g., E. coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter) are not always detectable in litter (Lu et al., 2003). The reason could be the less favorable microenvironment for microbial survival in the feces-bedding mixture than in feces alone. Microorganisms, including Globicatella sulfidofaciens, Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, Corynebacterium urealyticum, Clostridium aminovalericum, Arthrobacter sp., and Denitrobacter permanens, which may be involved in degradation of wood and cycling of nitrogen and sulfur have been identified in poultry litter (Lu et al., 2003).",

The contribution of these sources to airborne dust varies, depending on the animal species and the housing system. Heber et al. (1988a) reported that the main source of airborne dust in pig houses was feed, which is consistent with the findings of Donham et al. (1986) and Aarnink et al. (1999). Muller and Wieser (1987) found that 55\u201368% of the airborne dust in floor layer systems with litter originated from the bedding materials in litter, while 80\u201390% of the airborne dust in layer systems with battery system originated from feedstuff (Table 1). In floor systems with wood shavings as litter for three-week old broilers, Aarnink et al. (1999) found that airborne dust mainly (>10%) originated from down feathers and urine components. The contribution of feed to the airborne dust largely depends on its composition and how it has been processed (Pearson and Sharples, 1995M; e.g., crumbles or pellets). The contribution of feces is probably related to the housing system (e.g., with or without litter [straw bedding vs. liquid manure]). Table 1 lists the main sources of dust and gives an estimation of their contributions.\n\n",

The most common species of these Gram-positive bacteria are Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococci (Clark et al., 1983; Hartung, 1992; Matkovic et al., 2007). The Gram-negative bacteria account for only a small fraction of airborne bacteria (Zucker et al., 2000). Bakutis et al. (2004) reported that in terms of the total bacterial count, the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria was approximately 10% in cattle houses, 4.9% in pig houses, and 2.6% in poultry houses. Zucker et al. (2000) found that the airborne Gram-negative bacteria in pig and cattle houses were aerobic and include Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Neisseriaceae; no culturable obligate anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were isolated. Possible reasons for the smaller proportion of airborne Gram-negative bacteria in livestock production systems are that their excretion by animals is less than their counterparts and these bacteria are more vulnerable to environmental stress such as oxidation, radiation, and dehydration, probably because of their thinner cell walls (Pal et al., 2007; Theunissen et al., 1993). The proportion of fungi, molds, and yeasts in the airborne microbial flora in animal houses is low (Hartung, 1992; Lee et al., 2006). The most frequently reported fungi in poultry, pig, and dairy houses are Aspergillus sp., Alternaria sp., Cladosporium sp., Penicillium sp., Fusarium sp., Scopulariopsis sp., and yeast (Chang et al., 2001; Cormier et al., 1990; Martin et al., 1996; Matkovic et al., 2007; Vittal and Rasool, 1995; Wilson et al., 2002).",

The size distribution of microorganisms in poultry houses depends on the type of housing system. In broiler rooms with wood-shaving litter, most of the bacteria were nonrespirable in the full life cycle of broilers (eight weeks); a similar distribution pattern was found in broiler rooms with raised netting floor only after the birds were older than six weeks. When the birds were two to five weeks old, the proportions of airborne respirable and nonrespirable bacteria were similar (Madelin and Wathes, 1989).\n",

This is a reasonable hypothesis, because the larger a particle is, the greater the chance it may contain microorganisms. Nowadays, the size distribution of airborne microorganisms is normally determined with the Andersen stage impactor (Andersen, 1958; Zhao et al., 2011a). This sampler actually gives the counts of particles (in seven different size ranges) that contain microorganisms. In some cases, for instance a biosecurity assessment for occupational health, it is more important to quantify the individual microorganism in the collected particles rather than the microbial-containing particles themselves, because the former will give a better idea of the risk of infection. For this purpose, predetachment of microorganisms from dust particles (Zhao et al., 2011b) or visually microbiological counting techniques (Yamaguchi et al., 2012) may be required.",

So far, the studies by Seedorf et al. (1998) and Takai et al. (1998) still provide the most representative concentration data on microorganisms and dust in livestock production systems, and sampling methods were detailed in the publications by Phillips et al. (1998) and Wathes et al. (1998). These data are summarized in Table 2, together with the PM10 and PM2.5 concentration measured by Lai et al. (2010). For microorganisms, the highest concentrations of airborne bacteria and fungi were found in broiler houses. The concentrations found in layer, pig and cattle houses were lower than those in broiler houses, but still much higher than those in ambient air (Wang et al., 2010).

Housing systems with bedded floors caused more air quality problems, although such housing systems are generally thought to be more beneficial for animal welfare (Kim et al., 2008; Madelin and Wathes, 1989; Quarles et al., 1970). The type of bedding material also affects the concentration of microorganisms in the air.

By contrast, concentrations of total bacteria and fungi were lower in naturally ventilated pig houses without bedding materials (deep-pit manure system with slats, and manure removal system by scraper) than in mechanically ventilated houses.

Investigations of the relation between hygiene and air quality have found they are not always positively correlated. Duchaine et al.

However, a nonsignificant correlation between these variables has also been reported in livestock production systems (Banhazi et al., 2008b; Seedorf et al., 1998). The probable reason for these contradictory findings is that ventilation affects the concentration of microorganisms and dust in two ways: by exhausting airborne microorganisms and dust to outdoors through air exchange, thereby reducing their indoor concentrations, and by producing airflow turbulence above surfaces, agitating the particles and causing them to suspend in the air, thus compromising the removal effect. Smaller airborne particles seem to be more effectively removed from livestock houses by ventilation than bigger particles (Kuehn, 1988) because they are readily transported in the air streams.",

In humid environments, the dust particles bind to the surface and are not easily suspended, and those in the air aggregate and to settle faster (Heber et al., 1988b; Takai et al., 1998). In contrast, humidity seems not to affect the concentrations of total and Gram-negative bacteria (Attwood et al., 1987; Banhazi et al., 2008b; Nicks et al., 1993). A high humidity favors survival and/or multiplication of dehydration-sensitive microbial species in the sources (de Rezende et al., 2001), which might trade off the physical settlement of airborne microorganisms. Experimental validation of this hypothesis is of importance, because it may strengthen the understanding of the interaction between airborne microorganism concentration and air humidity. This will help to formulate effective air humidification strategies for reducing both, dust and microorganisms, instead of achieving one by compromising the other. This information will also be valuable for understanding the bioenvironment in livestock houses where air humidification (e.g., water spray and evaporation cooling pad) is used to ameliorate animal heat stress in summer time (Brown-Brandl et al., 2010; Tao and Xin, 2003).",

(1997) reported that the total dust in broiler rooms increased when the temperature was set 2\u00b0C above the recommended level. The correlation between dust concentration and temperature reverses from positive to negative when the temperature is extremely high, apparently because animal activity decreases at high temperature and thus fewer particles from surfaces are disturbed and suspended (Donkoh, 1989; Guarino et al., 1999; Wylie et al., 2001). As well, a high temperature triggers a series of events that may affect the dust concentrations in livestock production systems, such as increasing the ventilation rate and activating wet cooling systems (Simmons and Lott, 1996). Although some researchers (Banhazi et al., 2008a) have suggested there is a relation between the concentration of microorganisms and temperature, little information is available so far.",

            "text": "Mechanisms affecting physical decay of particles are listed in Table 3. In reality, these mechanisms may have collective effect on a particle, but the dominant mechanism varies mainly with particle size (e.g., decay of larger particles is prone to drive by gravimetric sedimentation whereas decay of smaller particles is mainly determined by diffusion (Abadie et al., 2001; He et al., 2005). Physical decay can be quantified by the rate of deposition (deposition rate loss coefficient or deposition velocity; Deshpande et al., 2009). Lai (2002) reviewed the deposition rate for particles ranging from 0.01 to 10 \u03bcm and found it had a U-shaped pattern. The lowest deposition rate was found for particles ranging from 0.1 to 1 \u03bcm because particles in this range were less affected by either sedimentation or diffusion than their counterparts do. Besides particle size, deposition rate is affected by other factors such as room furnishing and air speed. Thatcher et al. (2002) found increasing surface area (provide more furniture) and air speed (by means of elevating ventilation rate) increased the deposition rate of particles (0.5\u201310 \u03bcm) in an experimental room.\n\n",

The decay rate is the decrease in concentration of viable microorganisms over time. A proportionality constant (k) indicates the extent of decay rate, and is shown in equation 1, where Co is the initial concentration of airborne microorganisms, Ct is the concentration of microorganisms at time t after initial (Phillips et al., 1964). The survival represents the percentage of viable microorganisms left at a certain moment vis-\u00e0-vis the initial microbial count (Wu, 2009). The half-life, t1/2, is the time taken for the concentration of viable microorganisms in the air to decrease by half (see equation 2). Previous studies showed that the biological decay of airborne microorganisms was species-dependent and was determined by many external factors, such as humidity, oxygen concentration, temperature, ozone concentration, radiation (UV, \u03b3-ray, X-ray), air ions, and air pollutants (CO, SO2, and NOx; Benbough, 1971; Lighthart, 1973).\n(1)k=logC0/Ctt(2)t1/2=log2\u00d7tlogC0/Ct",

In the early studies, the measure most used for humidity was relative humidity (RH; the ratio of the actual water vapor pressure of the air to the water vapor pressure of saturated air at a certain temperature). The results of these studies showed that different microorganisms were prone to decay either at low RH (Lighthart, 1973), at median RH (Wright et al., 1968b), or at higher RH (Songer, 1967; Theunissen et al., 1993). More recently, a few studies have used absolute humidity (AH; the actual water content of the air) as another measure of humidity. For instance, Shaman and Kohn (2009) reported that the survival of airborne influenza virus was more significantly constrained by AH than by RH. The authors argued that RH is a meaningful physical quantity and for certain organisms may affect biological response; however, the AH can be of greater biological significance for many organisms. Some studies reported significant effects of other measures of humidity, such as evaporation potential (EP; the difference between actual water vapor content in the air and the water vapor content in saturated air at the same temperature), on microbial survival (Zhao et al., 2012). Although a bunch of studies have been carried out, it is not yet fully understood how humidity influences microbial decay.",

The wavelength of UV between 10 nm and 120 nm has the highest energy, but this type of UV is blocked by normal dioxygen in air and cannot reach the ground. The rest of UV radiation, from low to high energy, is categorized as UV-A (320\u2013400 nm), UV-B (280\u2013320 nm), and UV-C (100\u2013280 nm), of which UV-C is considered to be the most germicidal. The UV-C wavelength between 250\u2013270 nm can be effectively absorbed by microbial genetic material, and is the UV wavelength most lethal to microorganisms (Keyser et al., 2008). The germicidal effect of UV-C light on bacteria and viruses is primarily due to the formation of pyrimidine (thymine and cytosine) dimers that inhibit the replication and function of genetic material (Giese and Darby, 2000; Prescott et al., 2005). Bacteria decay more readily under UV radiation than RNA viruses (Harris et al., 1987; Hijnen et al., 2006). The probable reason for this is that the thymine of bacterial DNA is more vulnerable to dimerization induced by UV than the uracil of viral RNA. The mechanism whereby UV-A and UV-B (also called near-UV) inactivates microorganisms is suspected to be the breaks in strands of genetic materials that are induced by the UV itself and toxic tryptophan photoproducts (Prescott et al., 2005). Visible light may also damage microorganisms. Microbial pigments become excited when they absorb light energy, and are transferred to O2, generating singlet oxygen (1O2), which is a highly reactive oxidant (Valduga et al., 1993). As a self-protecting mechanism, some microorganisms may possess carotenoids that can absorb the excitation energy and reduce the formation of singlet oxygen, thus preventing cells from being damaged by light radiation (McCambridge and McMeekin, 1981).",

Many aerobic microorganisms contain enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, which protect the cell against oxidation by the derivatives; all the strictly anaerobic microorganisms lack these enzymes (Prescott et al., 2005). The effect of oxygen level on decay of airborne Serratia marcescens 8UK and E. coli B was studied by Cox (1989), who reported that oxygen was toxic for these microorganisms only when RH was lower than 70%. The toxicity increased with oxygen concentrations up to 30%; higher concentrations produced no additional toxicity. This finding was generally in agreement with other similar studies (Benbough, 1967; Hess, 1965). Viruses seem to be less sensitive to oxygen than bacteria. The decay of airborne viruses that included Semliki Forest virus, Langat virus, T7 coliphage, Poliovirus, and Encephalomyocarditis virus was no different whether they were aerosolized in the air or in nitrogen (Benbough, 1971; de Jong et al., 1975).",

Ozone may damage the viral nucleic acids of viruses and alter the polypeptide chains of the viral protein coat (de Mik and de Groot, 1977; Kim et al., 1999; Roy et al., 1981). Investigations of the ozone effect on decay of airborne microorganisms showed that fungi seemed more resistant to ozone than bacteria; Gram-positive bacteria were more resistant than Gram-negative ones (Heindel et al., 1993; Kowalski et al., 1998). Ozone alone can be toxic to airborne microorganisms; however, its toxicity is enhanced when ozone reacts with compounds in the ambient air, known as open air factors (OAF). Studies have shown that mixture of ozone with olefins (de Mik et al., 1977; Druett and Packman, 1972) and ozone with negative air ions (Fan et al., 2002) are more toxic to airborne microorganisms than ozone alone.",

When microorganisms are carried by the dust, they may suffer less radiation and exposure to toxic gas, and less fluctuation in micro-climate (Milling et al., 2005). It has been found that individual bacteria are effectively inactivated by ozone; however, when these bacteria were covered with a coating of organic matter, as a bio aerosols, ozone in permissible concentration had no effect (Elford and van den Ende, 1942). As well as providing physical protection, the composition of dust particles might give bio-chemical support to microorganisms. In order to metabolize, microorganisms require carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and other elements (Maus et al., 2001). Compounds containing these elements are abundant in airborne dust from livestock production systems (Aarnink et al., 1999; Muller and Wieser, 1987). An interesting hypothesis is that microbial decay in particles differs, depending on the composition of the particles. Actually, in some laboratory experiments, it appears that decay of microorganisms differs as they are aerosolized from liquid suspensions with different chemical compounds.

In these experiments, microorganisms were aerosolized in airspace that was sampled at certain intervals. The biological decay was indicated by the amounts of collected microorganisms at different sampling moments. The results of selected studies are summarized in Tables 4 and 5. The selection of references follows the procedures and screening criteria as below: first, all references related to biological decay of any species of airborne microorganisms were searched in literature databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar); second, only references in which biological decay was investigated by excluding confounding effect of physical decay (e.g., using inert tracers or labeled microorganisms) were selected; third, due to the fact that some microorganisms showed a biphase biological decay (with a fast initial decay rate in the first few seconds or minutes after aerosolization, followed by a slow secondary decay) and the airborne transmission concerned is long distance and time (Brankston et al., 2007; Cox, 1971; Songer, 1967; Webb, 1959), only the secondary biological decay is presented in the tables. The tables show the highest biological decay at the least favorable temperature/RH, and the lowest biological decay at the most favorable temperature/RH. The values of biological decay have been presented in three ways: decay rate, survival and half-life. By reviewing the results in Tables 4 and 5, it proofs that the biological decay largely varies between the microbial species and is profoundly affected by temperature and RH.\n\n\n",

Wet aerosolization does mimic the fate of microorganisms expelled from animal respiratory tracts in wet aerosols. However, after they have been generated, the large wet aerosols containing microorganisms settle on surfaces and the small ones shrink into dry nuclei; both processes are very fast, taking only seconds to minutes (Kincaid and Longley, 1989; Sun and Ji, 2007; Wells, 1934). Therefore, the microorganisms in wet aerosols can only be transported over short distances and induce infections in limited areas (Brankston et al., 2007). For microorganisms released from dry sources such as feces and litter, which may be more closely associated with long distance transmission, dry aerosolization is recommended. Dry aerosolization may give a picture of the biological decay of microorganisms that differs from the decay in wet aerosolization because the microorganisms may suffer either dehydration stress at low ambient RH or rehydration at high ambient RH (Cox, 1971).",

(1986), the probability of deposition will be different for each particle even if all the particles in the air inhaled in one breath are identical, because the inhaled air with particles penetrates the respiratory tract to different depths where it remains for different periods of time, and because of the stochastic nature of particle transport. Therefore, particle deposition (in the respiratory tract) refers to the \u201cmean probability\u201d of an inspired particle being collected on airway surfaces. Particle deposition in the respiratory tract depends on particle characteristics (e.g., size, shape, density) and breathing pattern (e.g., nasal/oral breath, respiratory flow rate, cycle period), and is commonly expressed as a function of particle size.",

In principle, the deposition of particles is governed by the mechanisms of diffusion for particles <0.1 \u03bcm, or by diffusion and sedimentation for 0.1\u20131 \u03bcm particles, or by sedimentation and impaction for particles >1 \u03bcm (Heyder, 2004). On the basis of previous experimental studies, Heyder et al. (1986) developed a semiempirical deposition model for particles ranging from 0.005 \u03bcm to 15 \u03bcm. The model-simulated deposition pattern for slow inspiration over a long period for both oral and nasal breathing is shown in Figure 2. The deposition has been shown for three regions of the respiratory tract\u2014extra-thoracic, bronchial, and alveolar\u2014based on how far down the tract particles may be deposited. In addition, total deposition is given (the sum of the deposition in the three regions). It can be seen that the total deposition is least for particles of 0.1\u20131 \u03bcm, and that the deposition increases as the size of small particles (<0.1 \u03bcm) decreases, and the size of the larger particles (>1 \u03bcm) increases. Particles larger than 10 \u03bcm are mainly deposited in the extrathoracic region, and cannot penetrate the alveolar region during slow and fast oral and nasal inspiration.\n",

Particle deposition in guinea pig head, trachea, and lungs was investigated by Harper and Morton (1953). They found an increasing regional deposition in guinea pig head for larger particles: 35.7% of the 1 \u03bcm particles were deposited in the guinea pig head region, compared with 98.1% of the 10 \u03bcm particles. The reverse was true for lung deposition: 55.2% of 1 \u03bcm particles and 0.6% of 10 \u03bcm were deposited in this region. The particle size most deposited in the trachea was 2.5 \u03bcm. A model of particle deposition in the guinea pig respiratory tract was established by Schreider and Hutchens (1979), who found that 99% of unit density particles of 10 \u03bcm or more could be deposited in the nasopharyngeal-tracheobronchial region (Figure 3). The lowest deposition was 10% for a particle size of 0.8 \u03bcm. About 17% of particles ranging from 0.08 to 4 \u03bcm could be deposited in the pulmonary region. However, this model was compromised by several assumptions that were made by the authors (e.g., laminar airflow in the respiratory tract, equal expansion of all lobes and alveoli, and complete mixing of the particles in the alveoli.\n",

The particles deposited in the head and anterior trachea were in the 3.7\u20137 \u03bcm size range, those deposited in the lung and posterior air sacs were 1.1 \u03bcm size, and those deposited in the caudal regions of the birds were in the size classes 0.091 and 0.176 \u03bcm. Those of size 0.312 \u03bcm were deposited mainly in upper airways. These early data of particle deposition in chicken airways are suspected to be compromised by the use of anesthetized chickens, because anesthesia alters the animals\u2019 breathing pattern. Corbanie et al. (2006) investigated the deposition of particles in a wider range (1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcm) in unanaesthetized chickens of three ages. Unlike the definition of deposition that was proposed by Heyder et al. (1986), Corbanie et al. (2006) defined deposition as the percentage of particles deposited in a particular region of the respiratory tract among those in the entire tract. They found that particles larger than 5 \u03bcm were too large to be deposited in the lungs and air sacs in 2- and 4-week-old chickens, as low percentages of particles were recovered in these regions (Figure 4). For 1-day-old chicks, however, the particle deposition in lungs and air sacs was independent of particle size and even particles of 20 \u03bcm were deposited in the lower airway, possibly due to the chicks having a different breathing pattern than older chickens.\n",

Infection is likely to fit a single-hit model, which means that one pathogenic microorganism may trigger an infection in a recipient. From this point of view, the infective dose (ID; or occurrence of infection) is therefore related to the probability that a recipient becomes infected after taking in a certain dose of pathogenic microorganisms, following a Poisson distribution. The ID of pathogenic microorganisms to human and animals has generally been expressed in two ways. In one way, ID is expressed as the number of infected recipients out of a population after a dose of microorganisms has been administered. The other way is to determine the microbial concentrations required to infect 50% of a population (ID50).",

For instance, a lower ID of FMD virus is needed to infect sheep and cattle than to infect a pigs (Alexandersen and Donaldson, 2002; Donaldson et al., 1987; Gibson and Donaldson, 1986). It can be also seen that a certain dose of a microorganism is not always capable of infecting all recipients, probably because of a difference in the resistance of individual recipients (due to e.g., age, breed; Roy, 1980). Furthermore, the route by which the microorganisms are administered may also be responsible for variation in ID (Cafruny and Hovinen, 1988; Zimmerman et al., 1993). In previous studies, the administration routes were either nasally or orally, or via aerosols, and these reflect different deposition situations and regions for microorganisms in the respiratory tract. Nasal administration simulates infection because larger microbial particles are deposited in the upper airways, the oral ministration may simulate oral breathing, and the aerosol administration simulates infection because smaller microbial particles are deposited in deeper airways. It was reported that the microorganisms had preferential sites for multiplication and infection because of the complex vulnerability of regions in respiratory tracts (Cafruny and Hovinen, 1988; Druett et al., 1953; Druett et al., 1956). This being so, infection occurs more readily when the microorganisms are administered to the more vulnerable region. Baskerville (1981) summarized the preferred infection regions of some microorganisms to animals by categorizing nose, pharynx, and tonsils as the upper respiratory tract, and the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles, and alveoli as the lower respiratory tract (Table 7).\n\n\n",

There are difficulties in doing the same with animals, therefore stationary samplers in their breathing zones are recommended. The recommended level of the breathing zone is 30\u201340 cm above floor level for pigs, 10\u201325 cm for poultry, and shoulder height for cattle (Kim et al., 2007a; Topisirovic, 2003; Zhao et al., 2011d). For growing animals these figures should be adjusted according to the animal height at a certain age. When emissions of microorganisms and dust are of interest, the best sampling location is in or near the air outlet. Care should be taken not to place the samplers at a location where the air speed is too high, because the efficiency of the sampler (the ratio of the aerial pollutant concentration calculated from the air samples to the true concentration in the air) may drift far from 100% (Grinshpun et al., 1994; Hofschreuder et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Due to the lack of a standard, the sampling duration for airborne microorganisms in different studies varies, but is normally less than 1 hr. The duration is determined by taking account of the estimated concentrations of microorganisms and the characteristics of the sampler in use. The sampling duration can be set at a short period (a few minutes) when the total microorganism is abundant in livestock houses. When the microorganism of interest is sporadically present, the period should be set long enough to collect enough microorganisms for further quantification analysis. Some samplers have not been designed to be used for long sampling duration. For instance, severe evaporation of liquid medium in All Glass Impinger (AGI-30) occurs when the sampling period is long and this may affect its sampling efficiency. The recommended maximum duration of the sampling period for the AGI-30 is 30 min. Impactors may easily become overloaded when samples are taken in livestock houses (Thorne et al., 1992), therefore, the sampling duration is limited to minutes or even to seconds. Filtration method would not encounter the problems (evaporation of sampling liquid and overloading) of impingers and impactors; however, long sampling duration by filtration may not benefit in microorganism collection because of the biological decay of microorganisms owing to dehydration (Griffin et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2001). In order to collect detectable amounts of microorganisms and to get representative samples over a longer period, some high-volume and durable samplers that can be continuously operated over hours have been developed and applied, including OMNI-3000 and high-volume impinger (Griffin et al., 2011; Kesavan and Schepers, 2006).",

These different sampling principles have their advantages and disadvantages. Samplers using the impaction principle (e.g., Andersen Six Stage Impactor) can be used to distinguish the microorganisms according to their sizes (Andersen, 1958). In addition, the bacteria impacted on agar plates may be directly incubated for viable counts. However, its susceptibility to overloading limits its sampling in livestock houses to short periods, which may result in nonrepresentative samples. The problem of overloading can be overcome by using samplers with the impingement principle, because the liquid samples may be decimally diluted and analyzed after sampling. A disadvantage of this sampler is that it may not be able to sample for a long time due to evaporation of the collection liquid (Lin et al., 1997). Filtration is a user-friendly method in a practical situation, but not suitable for sampling microorganisms that are vulnerable to dehydration stress.\n\n",

For particles in the range from 1 to 10 \u03bcm and an airflow rate between 0 and 500 cm s\u22121, the inlet sampling efficiency of the Andersen Six Stage Impactor is 90\u2013150% when the opening faces in direction of the air flow and 8\u2013100% when it is oriented perpendicularly to the horizontal aerosol flow (Grinshpun et al., 1994). The inlet efficiency of the AGI-30 for particles of 1 \u03bcm is close to 100%, but it is reduced to 70\u201390% for 5 \u03bcm particles and to 20\u201330% for 10 \u03bcm particles (Grinshpun et al., 1994). When the 50% collection efficiency of the Andersen Six Stage Impactor and AGI-30 was investigated it was found that the Andersen Six Stage Impactor has 50% collection efficiency for 6.6\u20137.0 \u03bcm particles at the first stage and 0.57\u20130.65 \u03bcm particles for the last stage (Andersen, 1958; Nevalainen et al., 1992).

This method easily ranks the performance of different samplers; however, it neither reveals whether the amount of microorganisms collected in the samples accurately represents the microorganism content of the air nor distinguishes between the physical and biological efficiency. Other studies separately investigated the physical and biological efficiency of bioaerosol samplers in aerosol experiments, in which a known amount of microorganisms together with an indicator (either labeled microorganisms, or inert tracer compound) were nebulized in an isolator. The physical efficiency can be determined by comparing the amount of tracer collected by a bioaerosol sampler with that collected by the reference sampler (a sampler that has a high physical efficiency); the biological efficiency is subsequently indicated by the change in the ratio of microorganisms/indicator. Using this method, Zhao et al.

These systems show steep collection curves for sampling fine dust in ambient air where dust load is low (Kenny et al., 2000). However, the preseparator with impaction principle may become overloaded when sampling in dusty livestock production systems, thereby resulting in overestimated concentrations of fine dust (Zhao et al., 2009). In contrast, a preseparator with cyclone principle has been found to be less vulnerable to overloading in dusty environments than preseparators based on impaction (Zhao et al., 2009).",

Kim et al. (2006) reported that spraying 60 ml m\u22122 of tap water, salt water, treated manure, microbial additive, soybean oil, artificial spice, and essential oil may all reduce particles in pig houses. These authors found an average reduction of 53% for airborne bacteria, 51% for fungi, and 30% for total dust. The substance for spraying found to be the most effective additive for reducing dust was soybean oil. In broiler rooms, Aarnink et al. (2009) reported that PM10 reduction increased linearly from 55 to 85% when daily rapeseed oil application rates increased from 6 to 24 ml m\u22122. The PM2.5 reduction was not related to application rate and was about 80%. In aviary systems for layers, a 34% reduction for PM10 and 50% reduction for PM2.5 were achieved by daily spraying with 20 ml m\u22122 (Aarnink et al., 2009). Although a high oil application rate achieves high PM10 reduction in broiler rooms, it may adversely affect animal health (Aarnink et al., 2011b). When spraying 24 ml m\u22122 daily, there was a tendency for statistically higher footpad lesion in broilers. Aarnink et al. (2009) recommended limiting oil application to 16 ml m\u22122.",

            "text": "The ionization (also referred to as electrostatic) technique produces negative ions in the air, which causes airborne particles to become negatively charged. The negatively charged particles are attracted to earthed or positively charged surfaces. Previous studies have shown promising reduction effects on dust in animal houses using ionization techniques, total dust was reduced by 13\u201361% in poultry houses (Lyngtveit and Eduard, 1997; Mitchell et al., 2000; Mitchell et al., 2004; Richardson et al., 2003), and by 45\u201358% in pig houses (Rosentrater, 2003; Tanaka and Zhang, 1996). Cambra-Lopez et al. (2009) reported that the technique produced average reductions of 36% for PM10 and 10% for PM2.5. The disparity is probably caused by the different charging mechanisms to particles. The small particles (<0.1 \u03bcm) are charged by the thermal charging mechanism, which is proportional to the diameter; large particles (>0.5 \u03bcm) are charged by field charging mechanism, which is proportional to the square of the diameter (Bundy, 1984). Ionization has the potential to prevent airborne transmission of microorganisms (Gast et al., 1999; Holt et al., 1999), however, no reduction of airborne bacteria, fungi and mold was found in broiler houses by this technique (Cambra-Lopez et al., 2009). Knowledge of ionization on reduction of airborne microorganisms in animal houses is still limited and needs to be augmented.",

(2001) found a deduster removed 90% total dust from the air exhausted from a pig house. Because dedusters are based on the centrifuge principle, they are more effective at removing larger particles than smaller ones. The deduster studied by Zhang et al. (2001) had a removal efficiency of 90% for particles larger than 10 \u03bcm, 77% for 7 \u03bcm particles, and 50% for 4 \u03bcm particles. The low removal efficiency for small particles was assumed to be particle re-entrainment due to high air turbulence. Acid and biological air scrubbers were originally developed to reduce ammonia and odor emissions, and they also appear to be effective in reducing particle emissions. An acid scrubber that uses sulfuric acid may achieve a 70% reduction of total bacteria (Aarnink et al., 2011a). In a lab-scale experiment, Aarnink et al. (2011a) found that E. faecalis and Gumboro virus could be reduced by 100% when per-acetic acid was used as the circulation solution in a scrubber. The biological scrubbers are not consistent in reducing microorganisms (Seedorf and Hartung, 1999), probably because the microorganisms for digesting odorous compounds can also be emitted to the ambient air. The removal of total dust by biological scrubbers was found to be 22\u201396% (Seedorf and Hartung, 1999).",

            "text": "Combined techniques have been applied in practice: for instance, oil spraying combined with feed coating (Takai and Pedersen, 2000) and multi-stage air scrubbers (Zhao et al., 2011a). These techniques are more consistent and effective in reducing emissions of airborne microorganisms and dust, as well as other gaseous pollutants (Ogink and Bosma, 2007; Zhao et al., 2008). A disadvantage of combined scrubbing techniques is the relatively high energy use and the complexity for use on practical farms. Therefore, further research is needed to develop energy-saving and simple-to-operate combined scrubbing techniques.",

            "text": "The most important source of airborne microorganisms is the animals themselves by means of excretion. The sources of dust include excrement, litter, feed, skin, and feathers.Airborne microorganisms in animal houses are mostly bacteria, with Gram-positive bacteria predominating; fungi account for only a small proportion of microorganisms.Concentrations of both microorganisms and dust are high in animal houses. They are affected by animal type, housing system, management, and environmental factors. Because these factors play an interrelated role on the concentrations of microorganisms and dust, integrated research on the effects is required.The microorganisms transmitted in the air suffer physical and biological decay. The physical decay largely depends on their size, and the biological decay is mainly determined by environmental factors, such as humidity, temperature, radiation, and toxic gases. In airborne transmission, microorganisms may be carried by dust particles that may protect microorganisms from biological decay. Knowledge of the role of dust in the transportation of microorganisms is still lacking, and needs to be expanded.Microorganisms are deposited on different regions in the respiratory tract, mainly depending on their size. They have different preferred infection regions in the respiratory tract. The amount of microorganisms needed to induce an infection varies with microorganism species and animal species.Reference methods for microorganism and dust sampling in animal houses need to be legislated. These methods should be resistant to highly microbial and dusty environments, and the efficiency of the sampling devices needs to be investigated.Different techniques have been applied to reduce airborne microorganisms and dust in and from animal houses. Combining several abatement techniques may achieve higher and more consistent reduction. Energy-saving and simple-to-operate combined techniques are of interest for further development.",
