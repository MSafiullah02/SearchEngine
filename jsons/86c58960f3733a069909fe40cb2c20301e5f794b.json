After universal droplet precautions and standard wearing of N95 masks by health care workers, there was eventual effective termination of transmission of SARS within acute healthcare facilities. 9 The 251 cases of confirmed coronavirus SARS in health care workers who were infected following exposure to patients with SARS highlighted important lessons to learn regarding personal protective equipment. When standard personal protective equipment (PPE; in this case a N95 mask, eye protection, gown and gloves) was used appropriately then the risk of transmission was low. 10 Healthcare workers however were often exposed to a high viral load in the emergency department or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) before standard PPE was donned for emergency intubation procedures. Subsequent interviews with staff involved in intubating infectious patients confirmed variable adherence to standard PPE recommendations. 7, 11 Toronto in 2003 quickly stopped all elective surgery, stopped all visitors, relatives and only essential on-call staff were allowed into the hospital, radically reducing the footfall of people in the building. Everyone who entered the building was instructed to wash their hands with alcohol gel, instructed to put on a face mask, asked to complete their contact details in a register, and patients and staff had their symptoms screened and temperature checked. Health authorities placed 8000 people in quarantine early in the epidemic. The rapid implementation of basic recommendations for screening and prompt isolation of all suspect patients and staff, together with quarantine of contacts, was ultimately effective in preventing significant health care worker and patient infection.",

The main transmission risks for all coronaviruses are exposure to droplets and contact transfer of virus. Droplets are heavy and usually disperse within a maximum 2 metre radius following coughing and sneezing by an infected patient. A notable exception is when we carry out procedures with patients that generate artificial aerosols (small particle nuclei, which may penetrate standard surgical masks and contaminate a wider dispersal radius). 12 Aerosol generating procedures include, for example, tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen provision, bronchial suctioning, bronchoscopy, and sputum induction. These procedures place clinicians in close proximity to the upper respiratory tract source of viral load and which have been linked to an increased risk of transmission of coronaviruses. 12 The minimal infective dose is defined as the lowest number of viral particles that causes an infection in 50% of individuals. Data on the human infectious dose by aerosol and surface contact (fomite) transmission routes are still lacking for the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen.",

One potential explanation may be earlier and higher accumulation of viral load in the upper respiratory tract of infected individuals. 19 The viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were higher in a small case series of 18 patients 20 than for patients with SARS-CoV. 21 In the same study, the viral load in a single asymptomatic patient (tested due to close contact with known cases) was similar to that in symptomatic patients, which may support reports of transmission earlier in the course of infection. 22 These patterns appear similar to patients with influenza 23 and imply value in early case detection to prevent the transmission of infections. Despite these findings, it is important to appreciate that, based upon generalised principles of viral transmission, asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers are likely to disperse less viral load and ultimately be less contagious than symptomatic individuals, but at present we are unable to quantify by how much.",

Although surface sampling from the rooms of patients with COVID-19 showed extensive environmental contamination, post-cleaning samples were negative, suggesting that current decontamination measures are sufficient. Air sampling of patient rooms was also negative, although patients in the study had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms only and did not undergo any aerosol generating procedures. 26 A series of regularly updated international recommendations on healthcare infection control throughout early 2020 have reflected three challenges: applying the learning from previous pandemic and inter-pandemic periods; a rapidly evolving understanding of the risk of infection transmission for COVID-19; and finally, a need to be proportionate regarding equipment utilisation during a pandemic. During this time the WHO 27 , European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 28 and Public Health England (PHE) 29 all moved from a \"one size fits all\" strategy, to one in which PPE use is risk stratified and the appropriate PPE is selected for the task required. Thus incremental contact, droplet and airborne precautions against COVID-19 have been established in the UK 29, 30 , meaning that all clinical areas considered to have frequent aerosol generating procedures, including ICU and operating theatres have similar PPE precautions. An exception to this standard is during neuraxial anaesthesia for elective caesarean delivery, during which the risk of conversion to an aerosolising general anaesthetic is considered to be low and predictable in advance, hence droplet precautions are adequate for anaesthetists. 31 A risk adaptive approach is recommended for other environments, where precautions should follow the risk of transmission during different clinical interactions. A common feature of all recommendations is that, irrespective of PPE required for each task, the equipment is used carefully and correctly, focusing particularly on safe removal.",

SARS-CoV-2 virus can initially be detected 1-2 days prior to symptom onset from upper respiratory tract samples. In moderate cases the virus persists for 7-12 days and up to 2 weeks in severely affected patients. 1 Prolonged viral RNA shedding has been reported in a virologic assessment of 18 patients in Singapore, with a median (range) duration of viral RNA shedding from the nasopharynx of 12 days (1-24). 33 Whilst SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing over long periods of time in bodily fluids, this does not necessarily correlate with the period that each individual is infective for. A small German case series indicates live virus viability may last only for the first week of symptoms 34 , with incompleteness of this evidence exposed in varied national recommendations for the de-isolation of COVID-19 patients. 35 SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in multiple asymptomatic individuals, some with similar viral load to symptomatic patients. 20 Potential transmission from asymptomatic persons has also been reported. 36 Provided that there are sufficient resources, there is a clear benefit to extending testing for COVID-19 as widely as possible.

The majority of self-contamination errors happens during doffing. 55 Enough time should be allocated for preparation of airway equipment and fitting of PPE outside the intubating room. A checklist or cognitive aid should be used for preparation and intubation. Communication in full PPE can be challenging. Preparing team members, assigning roles and setting out the airway plan before donning and entering the intubation room, improves safety and team effectiveness. Intubating teams should be limited to one experienced intubator, one skilled assistant (such as an intensive care nurse or operating department practitioner) and one team leader who acts as a backup intubator and administers drugs. 52 A runner should be placed outside the room to assist the intubating team. A strategy to target the most successful first attempt at intubation logically dictates that the most experienced anaesthetist is hands-on with the airway and that videolaryngoscopy is used to limit exposure risk.",

            "text": "High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) delivers humidified, warmed oxygen via specialised nasal cannula at flow rates up of to 60 L min -1 . Paediatric circuits typically deliver a lower maximum flow of up to 25 L min -1 . The WHO advises that HFNO should be used for selected adult patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure 56 and that HFNO can reduce the need for intubation. 57 Patients using HFNO should be in a monitored area and anaesthetists should be available to intubate the patient should they clinically deteriorate, or not improve after a short trial of ~1 hour. 56 Exhaled aerosol dispersion of viral load during HFNO is of concern for the personal safety of staff caring for these patients in close proximity. A number of studies have measured air dispersion during HFNO 58, 59 , although precisely how this relates to viral droplet or aerosol particles remains unclear. Mean (SD) dispersion distances increased from 65 mm (15) to 172 mm (33) as flow increased from 10 to 60 L m -1 . This increased to 620 mm laterally if the HFNO fit was loose. 59 Consequently, current WHO recommendations suggest that HFNO should be avoided where airborne precautions and negative-pressure, airborne infection isolation rooms are not available. 60, 56 Both non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and HFNO should be considered to be aerosolising procedures. 58, 60 The use of NIV has previously been associated with the transmission of virus to healthcare workers during the previous SARS outbreak 61 , however since that outbreak in 2003 improvements in mask design may have reduced this risk. Measured air dispersion with a full-facemask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system has been subsequently compared to CPAP with nasal pillows. 59 Air dispersion with full-facemask CPAP was negligible at both low pressure (5 cm H 2 O) and high pressure ventilation (20 cm H 2 O). CPAP with nasal pillows performed worse with a maximum mean (SD) dispersion of 207 mm (11) at 5 cm H 2 O, up to a dispersion distance of 332 mm (34) at 20 cm H 2 O. Therefore patients on CPAP should ideally be cared for in negative pressure facilities with staff wearing PPE appropriate for airborne contamination. 62 The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) recommend that where necessary, patients using NIV should be isolated in side rooms with doors closed. 62 If necessary, several patients, all of whom should have confirmed COVID-19, can be cared for in a \"cohort bay\". Appropriate filters should be used in all CPAP and NIV circuits. 61 High-flow nasal oxygen has been used to prolong the apnoea phase during tracheal intubation and to reduce intubation rates in acute respiratory failure. In China it has been used in patients with COVID-19 [63] , but there are no studies looking at virus spread by aerosol droplet production and transmission with HFNO. Environmental bacterial contamination has been investigated comparing high-flow nasal therapy to face mask in critically ill patients with pneumonia [64] . This was not associated with increased air or contact surface contamination by either Gram-negative or total bacteria, and these findings were supported by systematic review [65] . However, for patients with COVID-19 in the absence of any evidence of survival benefit compared to conventional oxygen therapy and the potential for greater environmental viral contamination national guidance recommends the avoidance of HFNO [66] Critical care",

            "text": "The burden of rapidly escalating case numbers 32 has presenting new challenges for maintaining infection control in critically unwell patients. A typical ICU solution relies upon isolating contagious patients in neutral or negative pressure side rooms, possibly with neutral pressure anti-rooms. This engineering solution permits flexibility in the clinical management of ventilation for infected patients, including aerosol generating procedures such as NIV and HFNO. 61 However, the rapid mismatch in ratio of intensive care beds to patients needing critical care has led to a rapid need to develop surge capacity 41 PPE for COVID-19 has moved from a \"one size fits all\" to risk stratified approach. [27] [28] [29] Similarly ICU supportive management for COVID-19 is adopting an adaptive approach, accounting for forthcoming trials of CPAP/NIV 61 and consideration of HFNO, which the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) COVID-19 guideline has recently advocated. 63 There are no randomised or propensity matched studies on early versus late intubation for COVID-19, hence data on non-invasive forms of ventilatory support remain anecdotal. Despite the infection control dilemmas, cohorting of patients into ward areas and avoiding intubation presents a viable treatment strategy that has additional advantages of optimising resource utilisation, particularly nurse to patient ratios. These benefits need to be balanced by two factors: PPE for staff and the burden of increased oxygen flow required. 64 Impact on oxygen supplies for widespread use of non-invasive ventilation is likely to be considerable. Some non-invasive ventilatory modalities are very oxygen hungry, using the high flow to provide inspiratory pressure. Once these devices are deployed over and above basal consumption plus an increase in ventilator usage, the maximum flow rate through the Vacuum Insulated Evaporators (VIE) oxygen stores can quickly be reached. This results in oxygen failure to the entire hospital starting at the sites most distal to the regulator, with the only remedy being to limit the number of devices pulling oxygen through the regulator or to use more efficient equipment.",

Despite these findings, it is important to appreciate that, based upon generalised principles of viral transmission, asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers are likely to disperse less viral load and ultimately be less contagious than symptomatic individuals individuals,-but at present we are unable to quantify by how much.",

In China it has been used in patients with COVID-19 [63] , but there are no studies looking at virus spread by aerosol droplet production and transmission with HFNO. Environmental bacterial contamination has been investigated comparing high-flow nasal therapy to face mask in critically ill patients with pneumonia [64] . This was not associated with increased air or contact surface contamination by either Gram-negative or total bacteria, and these findings were supported by systematic review [65] . However, for patients with COVID-19 in the absence of any evidence of survival benefit compared to conventional oxygen therapy and the potential for greater environmental viral contamination national guidance recommends the avoidance of HFNO [66] Critical care",

Following the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003, and subsequently the H1N1 pandemic in 2009-2010, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) was established as a surveillance definition by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to enable timely detection of emerging respiratory infectious diseases. 1 On 30 December 2019 the first bronchoalveolar samples of a novel pneumonia-causing virus were extracted from a patient in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in",

By way of contrast, between 2012 and 2019 Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infected 2494 patients in 27 countries, although over 80% of cases occurred during 2012-2014 in Saudi Arabia; the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak resulted in 8437 cases in 26 countries. The global epidemiological crisis of COVID-19 has implications for strategic oversight, resource management and responsiveness in infection control.

Donning should start improvements in mask design may have reduced this risk. Measured air dispersion with a full-facemask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system has been subsequently compared to CPAP with nasal pillows.59 Air dispersion with full-facemask CPAP was negligible at both low pressure (5 cm H 2 O) and high pressure ventilation (20 cm H 2 O). CPAP with nasal pillows performed worse with a maximum mean (SD) dispersion of 207 mm(11)    at 5 cm H 2 O, up to a dispersion distance of 332 mm (34) at 20 cm H 2 O. Therefore patients on CPAP should ideally be cared for in negative pressure facilities with staff wearing PPE appropriate for airborne contamination.62 The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) recommend that where necessary, patients using NIV should be isolated in side rooms with doors closed.62 If necessary, several patients, all of whom should have confirmed COVID-19, can be cared for in a \"cohort bay\".

This engineering solution permits flexibility in the clinical management of ventilation for infected patients, including aerosol generating proceduresAGPs such as NIV and HFNO. 61 However, the rapid mismatch in ratio of intensive care beds to patients needing critical care, has led to a rapid need to develop surge capacity 41 and to innovate with models of critical care provision in facilities that may not have the same engineering solutions for infection control (for example, most operating theatres operate with a positive pressure air flow system). This means that as new ways of delivering critical care for patients develop, new and pragmatic approaches to the management of infection control are also needed.",

But, dDespite the infection control dilemmas, cohorting of patients into ward areas and avoiding intubation presents a viable treatment strategy that has additional advantages of optimising resource utilisation, particularly nurse to patient ratios. These benefits need to be balanced by two factors: PPE for staff and the burden of increased oxygen flow required.64 Impact on oxygen supplies for wide-spread use of non-invasive ventilation is likely to be considerable. Some non-invasive ventilatory modalities are very oxygen hungry, using the high flow to provide inspiratory pressure. Once these devices are deployed over and above basal consumption plus an increase in ventilator usage, the maximum flow rate through the Vacuum Insulated Evaporators (VIE) oxygen stores can quickly be reached. This results in oxygen failure to the entire hospital starting at the sites most distal to the regulator, with the only remedy being to limit the number of devices pulling oxygen through the regulator or to use more efficient equipment.Airflow within hospital wards can dramatically affect the risk of nosocomial transmission of some coronavirus strains. In situation where critical care patients need to be cohorted into large bays or other facilities, it is possible to covert entire ICUs into negative pressure areas.65 Although pregnant women do not appear to exhibit greater susceptibility to COVID-19 than the general population, establishing robust infection control within maternity departments presents unique challenges. In particular, containing a risk of post-natal transmission from mother to neonate and procedures to accommodate unscheduled patient presentations to labour ward and emergency care; all within an environment of high patient turnover.Performing common procedures for obstetric patients, such as neuraxial anaesthesia, is made more technically difficult and time consuming by PPE. These indirect risks mandate a change in approach for team working, information dissemination and decision making in the labour ward.Although evidence is limited at present, antenatal vertical transmission appears rare.66 Placental samples, amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs and breastmilk samples from COVID-19 infected mothers have all tested negative in case series.67,68  There is currently no evidence concerning transmission through genital fluids.Women presenting to labour ward should be screened prior to admission, then risk stratified, and resultant care provided in an appropriate environment. Increased ventilation during labour, particularly when coupled with symptoms secondary to COVID-19 lung sequelae,14 may increase airborne transmission. For these reasons, surgical facemasks should be worn by parturients. Entonox \u00ae (requiring removal of the facemask) is not classified as an aerosol generated procedure 31 but should only be used in combination with a standard single patient < 0.05 \u03bcm pore size hydrophobic filter 51 , to prevent the delivery system becoming contaminated with the virus. Although thrombocytopenia appears to be more common in COVID-19 infected patients 32 , neuraxial anaesthesia is not otherwise contraindicated and early epidural analgesia appears to be a preferred and pragmatic option for providing safe patient care.31 Use of birthing pools should be avoided in suspected or confirmed cases, given the inability to use adequate PPE for healthcare staff during water birth.Donning PPE is time consuming, yet expedient delivery of a neonate remains time critical in situations of neonatal distress. As challenging as the moral dilemma regarding staff, patient or neonatal prioritisation is, protection of staff must be of utmost importance. Women and their families need to be told about possible delays and obstetricians encouraged to declare early decisions for theatre delivery, in order to account for additional time required.",
