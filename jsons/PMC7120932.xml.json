            "text": "Plus-stranded (+)RNA viruses replicate their genomes by manipulating host cells and transforming them into viral \u201cfactories.\" Unraveling the interactions between viruses and their host cells as a function of time can contribute greatly to our understanding of the dynamics of viral infections. (+)RNA viruses replicate their genomes in a two-step process: through the production of minus-strand replication intermediates, followed by the production of (+)RNA progeny via the use of the (\u2013)RNA template. Interestingly, replication is an asymmetric process leading to a 20- to 100-fold excess of the new (+)RNA progeny. All known (+)RNA viruses assemble their own replicase complexes (RCs), likely containing both viral- and host-coded proteins (Ahlquist, 2002; Ahlquist et al., 2003; Buck, 1996; Nagy and Pogany, 2006; Noueiry and Ahlquist, 2003; Shi and Lai, 2005; Strauss and Strauss, 1999). In addition, replication takes place in membraneous compartments derived from intracellular organelles, such as the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), mitochondrion, vacuole, Golgi, chloroplast, and peroxisome (Salonen et al., 2005). Some viruses actively induce the formation of novel cytoplasmic vesicular compartments, using COPII-coated or possibly autophagosomal membranes (Cherry et al., 2006; Egger and Bienz, 2005; Kirkegaard and Jackson, 2005; Rust et al., 2001). Thus, replication of (+)RNA viruses is a complex process that involves numerous interactions among viral RNA, viral-coded, and host-coded proteins and host membranes (lipids). Dissecting the functions of the various replication-associated or replication-modulating molecules in (+)RNA replication is one of the major frontiers in current virus research. The picture emerging is that the mechanism of genome replication, and the functions of viral and host factors, might be somewhat analogous among various (+)RNA viruses in spite of their diverse genome organizations and gene expression strategies. Also, most of the previously identified host factors are conserved genes, suggesting that (+)RNA viruses might selectively target conserved host functions as opposed to species-specific factors. Such a strategy would help viruses broaden their host range by expanding infections to new host species. Altogether, host factors play crucial roles in all steps of (+)RNA replication. Host factors are also key determinants of the host range of a given virus and affect virus pathology, host\u2013virus interactions, as well as the evolution of the virus. Host factors could also be potent antiviral targets. Studies on host factors also contribute insights into their normal cellular functions, thus promoting understanding of the basic biology of the host cell.",

            "text": "Possibly, the most powerful means to identify host factors involved in (+)RNA replication are based on genome-wide approaches. Intensive (high-throughput) screens include systematic analysis of most genes available in the genome of a particular host. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is particularly useful for this approach since it has a small genome-size (\u223c5,800 genes) and a reduced level of redundancy among host genes. In addition, yeast is the best-known model for eukaryotic cell with the highest percentage of characterized genes in the genome useful to study the aspects of virus\u2013cell interactions. Also, the genome-wide screens can be performed with single-gene deletion (YKO) and the essential gene (yTHC) libraries of yeast. For this strategy to succeed, it is necessary to launch (+)RNA virus replication in yeast, usually based on plasmid-driven expression of viral RNA/proteins. Yeast as a host for Brome mosaic virus (BMV) was pioneered by the Ahlquist laboratory, and subsequently was adapted for studying replication of Flock house virus (FHV) and tombusviruses of plants, such as Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) (Ishikawa et al., 1997b; Janda and Ahlquist, 1993; Panavas and Nagy, 2003; Panaviene et al., 2004; Pantaleo et al., 2003; Price et al., 2000). The genome-wide screens of 80% of yeast genes with BMV and 95% of yeast genes with TBSV led to the identification of over 100 yeast genes for both viruses that affected their replication (Jiang et al., 2006; Kushner et al., 2003; Panavas et al., 2005b). Interestingly, only a small set of yeast genes for BMV and TBSV overlapped, suggesting that these distantly related (+)RNA viruses use and/or are being affected by mostly different set of host genes for their replication (Jiang et al., 2006; Panavas et al., 2005b). Genome-wide screens with the yeast libraries have also been performed to identify host factors affecting RNA recombination in the case of TBSV, further illustrating the usefulness of this approach (Cheng et al., 2006; Serviene et al., 2006, 2005).",

            "text": "Due to the large number of studies using YTH screens, we cannot cover the entire area. Instead, we demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by discussing findings with HCV and poliovirus (PV). For example, NS5A of HCV was screened against an interferon-induced human hepatocyte cDNA library, leading to the discovery of the 33 kDa human vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (hVAP-A, also called hVAP-33) (Tu et al., 1999). hVAP-A also interacts with NS5B of HCV (Tu et al., 1999). Another YTH screen with the HCV NS5A, using human brain and liver cDNA libraries, led to the identification of the immunophilin, termed FKBP8, which is a human FK506-binding protein (Okamoto et al., 2006). When the NS5B RdRp protein was used as a bait, p68 helicase was identified as an interactor from a human spleen cDNA library (Goh et al., 2004). A screen with the HCV NS5B, using a human liver cDNA library, led to the identification of eIF4AII (a DEAD box RNA helicase) that partially co-localized with NS5B in infected cells (Kyono et al., 2002). Another YTH screen with the HCV NS5B protein, using a human hepatocyte cDNA library, led to the identification of ubiquitin-like protein hPLIC1, which functionally connects the ubiquitination machinery to the proteosome and could be involved in regulation of NS5B stability and HCV replication (Gao et al., 2003). Using a human thymus cDNA library against HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as a bait, Kim et al. identified eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (isoform 2, named eIF4AII) and septin 6, a GTP-binding protein involved in membrane dynamics, trafficking and cytoskeletal remodeling (Kim et al., 2007). Depletion of septin 6 by RNAi decreased HCV replication, suggesting that septin 6 is a necessary host factor for HCV (Kim et al., 2007). In the case of PV, Kirkegaard et al. found that Sam68 (Src-associated in mitosis, 68 kDa) interacted with the 3D RdRp protein, which resulted in re-localization of Sam68 to PV-induced cytoplasmic vesicles/membranes, the site of PV replication (McBride et al., 1996).",

Using the untranslated regions (UTRs) of a coronavirus RNA for UV-crosslinking, Lai, Leibowitz, Hogue, and their colleagues identified numerous RNA-binding host proteins, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1, polypyrimidine-tract-binding (PTB) protein, poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), and mitochondrial aconitase (m-aconitase) (Li et al., 1997; Nanda and Leibowitz, 2001; Shi and Lai, 2005; Spagnolo and Hogue, 2000). Also, the hnRNP-C that interacts with the (\u2013)RNA of PV has been identified (Brunner et al., 2005; Roehl and Semler, 1995). Using West Nile virus (WNV) (+) and (\u2013)RNAs, Brinton et al. identified several host proteins that were specifically UV-crosslinked to the viral RNA (Li et al., 2002). These cellular proteins included T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1), TIA-1-related protein (TIAR), and eEF1A. In the case of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a pestivirus related to HCV, various portions of the BVDV genomic (g)RNA were used in UV-crosslinking experiments with bovine and human cellular extracts (Isken et al., 2003). This work led to the identification of three RNA-binding proteins, named NF90 (nuclear factor 90, also called NFAR-1), NF45, and RNA helicase A (RHA), which are RNA-binding proteins containing double-stranded RNA-binding motifs.",

Activities include translation to produce viral proteins, replication, transcription [to produce subgenomic (sg)RNA for some viruses], encapsidation, and cell-to-cell movement (in the case of plant RNA viruses). These processes are highly regulated and compartmentalized to avoid collision between the ribosome and the viral RC. Recent advances in knowledge about (+)RNA virus replication have resulted in the division of the replication cycle into six separate steps (Fig. 14.1). These include (1) recruitment/selection of the viral (+)RNA template for replication (the switch of viral RNA from translation to replication); (2) targeting of viral replication proteins to the site of replication; (3) assembly of the functional viral replicase complex on intracellular membraneous surfaces; (4) synthesis of viral RNA progeny; (5) release of viral (+)RNA progeny from the site of replication; and (6) disassembly of the viral RC. In the following subchapter, we will discuss our current knowledge on the role of host factors in each of those steps.",

It has been estimated that a single viral RNA is translated 1,000\u201310,000 times (Quinkert et al., 2005). However, unlike host mRNAs, the viral (+)RNA has to be recruited for replication and saved from RNA degradation. Both host- and viral-coded proteins have been documented to participate in the regulation of the switch from translation to replication. Translation of the replication proteins and the selection of the viral gRNA for replication likely takes place in the cytoplasm, whereas replication of (+)RNA viruses occurs on the cytoplasmic faces of various organelle-derived membrane surfaces (Ahlquist et al., 2003; Buck, 1996; Salonen et al., 2005). Therefore, the viral gRNA, together with viral and host factors, must be transported/recruited to the site of replication. Current models involve specific template selection (specific binding of viral and/or host proteins to the template RNA) as a key step in regulation of (+)RNA replication.",

In the case of TBSV, highly specific binding of the p33 replication protein to a conserved sequence forming a long hairpin structure with an internal C\u2022C mismatch in the TBSV gRNA (termed the p33 recognition element, p33RE) is essential for TBSV RNA replication in yeast or virus replication in plants (Monkewich et al., 2005; Pogany et al., 2005). Additional in vitro and in vivo data firmly support the role of the p33:p33RE interaction as the major factor in selection of TBSV RNA for replication from the diverse RNA pool present in the host cell. Interestingly, the selection of viral RNA templates for replication is mechanistically similar to viral RNA encapsidation, which is also based on the requirement of a specialized viral protein, the coat protein, leading to packaging of the viral RNA into virions that are mostly inaccessible for other processes.",

For example, recruitment of BMV RNAs for replication is affected by Lsm1p, which belongs to the seven member Sm-like family of proteins (Diez et al., 2000; Noueiry et al., 2003). Lsm1p, together with Lsm2-7p, form the Lsm1p-7p heptameric ring, which is involved in mRNA turnover. Diez et al. found that Lsm1p-7p, which together with Pat1p and Dhh1p, is called the decapping activator complex, that moves cellular mRNAs from translation to degradation in the cytoplasmic processing bodies (termed P-bodies), and that might function as a key regulator to switch BMV RNAs from translation to replication (Mas et al., 2006). According to this model, the Lsm1p\u20137p/Pat1p/Dhh1p complex could refold the BMV RNAs allowing separation from ribosomes and translation factors and the binding of the BMV 1a replication protein to viral RNA. Then, the viral (+)RNA, likely in association with the replication proteins and host factors, ends up in the P-body that may serve as a place to pre-assemble the BMV RC prior to transport to the ER, where maturation likely occurs on the membranes (the site of BMV replication) (Beckham et al., 2007).",

            "text": "In the case of PV, a central role for the host poly(rC)-binding protein-2 (PCBP-2) in RNA template recruitment has been postulated. Based on this model, the full-length PCBP-2 can bind to stem-loop 4, which is part of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), in PV RNA as well as to the host protein SRp20 (involved in RNA trafficking) to promote the cap-independent translation of the PV RNA. Due to protease activity of the PV-coded 3CD or 3C, PCBP-2 is cleaved proteolytically, removing the KH3 RNA-binding site. The cleaved form of PCBP-2, however, still contains KH1-2 RNA-binding sites and it retains its ability to bind to stem-loop 1 in the PV RNA, which is critical for replication by bringing together the 3' and 5' ends of the PV RNA via interaction with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) (Perera et al., 2007; Walter et al., 2002). PCBP also binds to the spacer sequence located between the cloverleaf and the IRES, which is required for the replication (Toyoda et al., 2007). In addition to the cellular proteins, the PV-coded 3CD RdRp precursor regulates RNA template selection and switching of the viral RNA from translation to replication by binding to the coverleaf-like structure at the 5' UTR and affecting genome circularization (Gamarnik and Andino, 2000; Herold and Andino, 2001). The resulting genome circularization is predicted to be critical for PV minus-strand synthesis (Gamarnik and Andino, 1998, 2000; Herold and Andino, 2001; Perera et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Recruitment of BVDV RNA from translation into replication was proposed to depend on three interacting cellular factors: NF90, NF40, and RHA (Isken et al., 2003). Based on RNA competition studies that included various regions of the (+)RNA genome of BVDV, Behrens et al. proposed that NF90/NF40/RHA bind to both the 3' and the 5' UTRs, leading to circularization of the BVDV (+)RNA (Isken et al., 2003). This could be the signal to switch from translation to replication. Indeed, RHA has helicase activity that may facilitate the refolding of the viral RNA to make it suitable for replication. Also, NF90/NF40/RHA proteins are part of the antiviral response, thus their recruitment for BVDV replication in the cytoplasm can weaken the antiviral response that takes place in the nucleus. The NF90/NF40/RHA proteins together with NF110, might also promote the circularization of HCV (+)RNA via facilitating the interaction between the 5' UTR and the 3' UTR. Moreover, these proteins are re-localized to the site of HCV replication, suggesting that their roles could be similar in HCV as in BVDV RNA replication (Isken et al., 2007).",

Therefore, the viral (+)RNA and the viral-coded replication proteins must be targeted to those subcellular compartments (Fig. 14.1, step 2). The viral gRNA is likely recruited in cis by the newly produced replication proteins, which could bind to the gRNA present in the same location (cis-binding) (Neeleman and Bol, 1999; Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994; Oster et al., 1998; Panaviene et al., 2003; Vlot et al., 2003; Weiland and Dreher, 1993) during natural infections. Altogether, recruitment in cis may be a more efficient process than recruitment in trans that could secure the effective transportation of the limited amount of viral gRNA to the site of replication. The picture emerging from recent studies with several (+)RNA viruses is that both viral- and host-coded proteins participate in the intracellular targeting/transport step.",

Formation of the multimolecular complexes including the replication proteins, viral RNA, and some host factors, in the cytoplasm would likely facilitate efficient transport and co-localization of all these essential components to the same replication sites maximizing the assembly of fully functional RCs. Such organization can greatly increase the probability of successful replicase assembly.

TOM1/3 are also part of the ToMV RC and they likely act as anchors of the RC to the membrane via their transmembrane domains. Mutations or RNAi-based depletion of TOM1/3 severely inhibited ToMV replication in Arabidopsis plants (Yamanaka et al., 2002, 2000).

Electron microscopy (EM) and immuno-EM images of the sites of BMV replication, containing the active viral RC, revealed that the sites of BMV replication consist of 50\u201360 nm spherule-like structures with cellular membranes surrounding the replication proteins and the viral RNA (Schwartz et al., 2002). Interestingly, individual spherules contain small openings (membraneous necks), which likely serve as gates for transportation of molecules between the spherules and the cytoplasm (Schwartz et al., 2002). In a broad sense, we can regard one separate spherule as one active/matured RC. Studies on the molecular composition of a single spherule based on immuno-labeled images revealed that one spherule could contain 25-fold more 1a replication protein than 2apol, whereas the actual number and nature of host molecules within single spherules are currently unknown. Current models predict that highly organized protein:protein and protein:RNA complexes, with the help of cellular membranes, facilitate the formation of an active (+)RNA virus RC.",

Therefore, assembly of the viral replicase could be an important regulatory step in (+)RNA virus replication. Moreover, co-expression of (+)RNA has been shown to enhance replicase assembly/activity by \u223c40- to 100-fold for TBSV and was required for the BMV replicase in yeast (Panaviene et al., 2005, 2004; Quadt et al., 1995) and the AlMV replicase in plants (Vlot et al., 2001). Thus, the viral (+)RNA may serve as a platform to facilitate replicase assembly. It is also possible that initiation of minus-strand synthesis might lead to the stabilization of the viral RC.",

These include both viral and host factors that likely contribute to replicase assembly. For example, cellular chaperones may play essential roles in the assembly of viral replicases. The documented cases include Ydj1p, J-domain protein of the Hsp40 chaperone family that was found to affect minus-strand synthesis of BMV in yeast, but not the 1a-mediated recruitment of viral RNA or 2apol to the site of replication (Tomita et al., 2003). Also, Ydj1p affected the amount of 2apol present as a soluble protein and a reduced amount of Ydj1p in yeast led to aggregation of a fraction of 2apol. Based on these data and the known property of Ydj1p, Ahlquist and co-authors proposed that Ydj1p is involved in the assembly and/or activation of the BMV RC prior to minus-strand synthesis (Tomita et al., 2003). Serva and Nagy proposed a similar function for the Hsp70 proteins (termed Ssa1p and Ssa2p in yeast) in folding/activation of tombusvirus RC (Serva and Nagy, 2006). Indeed, deletion of SSA1/2 led to fourfold decrease in TBSV replication in yeast and reduced the amount of the replication proteins, suggesting that Hsp70 might stabilize the replication proteins. Also, Ssa1/2p were found to bind to the p33 replication protein and be present within the highly purified tombusvirus RC (Serva and Nagy, 2006).",

The formation of the vesicular compartment by DCV depends on the COPI host protein (Cherry et al., 2006). Depletion of COPI via RNAi reduced cytoplasmic vesicles by 2.5-fold, suggesting that the COPI coatomer is critical for the formation of the DCV-induced vesicular compartment. The induction of COPI-based vesicle formation could be regulated by small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1). Indeed, the PV RC recruits Arfs, which, in GTP-bound form (the membrane-associated active form), could recruit other cellular proteins to change membrane curvature, induce transport vesicles from intracellular membrane organelles, and stimulate phospholipase D activity that modifies the lipid composition of membranes (Belov and Ehrenfeld, 2007; Belov et al., 2007). PV 3A has been shown to recruit GBF1, a GEF (guanine exchange factor) to facilitate Arf1-activation/localization to the membrane, whereas the PV-coded 3CD protein binds to BIG1/2 GEFs (Belov et al., 2007). Thus, it is likely that PV 3A and 3CD proteins act synergistically to modify the cellular membrane traffic pathway to facilitate the formation of the PV RC (Belov and Ehrenfeld, 2007). Additional data from Wessels et al. revealed that modulation of the Arf-activating pathway by PV might also lead to inhibition of cellular secretion to ensure survival in the infected animal (Wessels et al., 2006a,b). Moreover, reticulon 3 cellular protein, which interacts with the 2A protein of several picornaviruses, might also be involved in modulating the assembly of the viral RC (Tang et al., 2007).",

The cellular hVAP-A, a vesicle membrane transport protein associated with HCV NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B replication proteins, was shown to play a critical role in the assembly of the HCV RC on lipid rafts (Gao et al., 2004). hVAP-A is partially associated with lipid rafts and dominant negative versions of hVAP-A or RNAi-driven depletion of hVAP-A resulted in relocation of NS5B from detergent-resistant to detergent-sensitive membranes. In addition, the NS5A and hVAP-A interaction is also critical for HCV RC assembly, based on the observation that hypophosphorylated NS5A can interact with hVAP-A, leading to efficient replication, whereas the hyperphosphorylated NS5A cannot interact with hVAP-A resulting in reduced replication (Evans et al., 2004). More recently, hVAP-B, a ubiquitous VAP-A-like protein, has also been implicated in HCV replication (Hamamoto et al., 2005). hVAP-B interacts with both NS5A and NS5B of HCV and it is likely part of the HCV RC because specific antibody against VAP-B inhibited HCV replication in vitro. Furthermore, depletion of hVAP-B by RNAi inhibited HCV replication. Unlike overexpression of hVAP-A, the overexpression of hVAP-B enhanced HCV replication, suggesting that hVAP-B is the limiting factor in the formation of the heterodimer between hVAP-A and hVAP-B, which could be the most effective form in facilitating HCV replication (Hamamoto et al., 2005). Overall, hVAP-A and likely hVAP-B play roles in targeting NS5B to the membrane and the assembly of the RC on lipid rafts (Gao et al., 2004).",

Consistent with this observation, in the ole1-mutant yeast, the membranes surrounding the BMV 1a-induced spherules, the site of BMV replication, were stained poorly by osmium tetroxide, which specifically binds to unsaturated fatty acids. Additional work defined that the BMV 1a was still able to induce membrane proliferation by 25% in the ole1-mutant yeast, but the activity of the assembled RC was reduced, likely due to the altered binding of the BMV 1a replication protein to the membrane with reduced ratio of unsaturated fatty acids (Lee and Ahlquist, 2003).",

Deleterious RNA mutations introduced at the eEF1A binding sites decreased minus-strand synthesis, strongly suggesting that eEF1A plays a critical role in WNV replication. Moreover, eEF1A is co-localized with the WNV RC in the infected cells, indicating that eEF1A facilitates the interaction between the viral replicase and the 3' UTR of the viral gRNA (Davis et al., 2007). Similarly, eEF1A binds to the 3' end of Turnip yellow mosaic virus (+)RNA, which enhances translation, but represses minus-strand synthesis (Matsuda et al., 2004). The role of eEF1A in virus replication might be rather broad since eEF1A was reported to bind to TMV (+)RNA, the TMV replicase (Yamaji et al., 2006), to the NS5A replication protein of BVDV (Johnson et al., 2001), NS4A of HCV (Kou et al., 2006), Gag polyprotein of HIV-1 (Cimarelli and Luban, 1999), the TBSV RNA, and p33 replication protein (Li and Nagy, unpublished).

Immunoprecipitation of hnRNP-C led to co-purification of both (+) and (\u2013) PV RNAs.

The RNA chaperone activity of hnRNP-C could facilitate the folding of (\u2013)RNA or the replicative dsRNA intermediate into a replication-compatible conformation that leaves the two terminal adenines exposed via binding to a 3' proximal uridine stretch (Brunner et al., 2005).",

Brinton et al. proposed that specific binding of TIAR and, to lesser extent, TIA-1 could promote the binding of the WNV to the minus-strand template, which could lead to efficient plus-strand synthesis. In addition to the proposed transcription factor roles of TIAR and TIA-1, the recruitment/sequestration of these proteins for WNV replication might also inhibit the formation of stress granules and P-bodies, thus potentially inhibiting the shut-off of host protein translation and mRNA degradation (Emara and Brinton, 2007).",

            "text": "One of the hallmark features of (+)RNA viruses is the asymmetric nature of viral RNA synthesis, which leads to 10- to 100-fold more (+)RNA progeny than the (\u2013)RNA replication intermediate (Buck, 1996). Wang and Nagy (unpublished) found that the key co-opted host protein for TBSV replication that regulates asymmetrical RNA synthesis is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, or Tdh2/3p in yeast). GAPDH, which is present in the tombusvirus RC (Serva and Nagy, 2006), is a highly conserved, very abundant protein that is ubiquitous in nature (Sirover, 1999). GAPDH is a key component of cytosolic energy production, but it also displays many additional cellular activities, including roles in apoptosis, endocytosis, nuclear tRNA transport, vesicular secretory transport, nuclear membrane fusion, modulation of the cytoskeleton, DNA replication and repair, maintenance of telomere structure, and transcriptional control of histone gene expression (Sirover, 1999, 2005). GAPDH also binds to various RNAs, such as AU-rich sequences at the 3' terminus of mRNAs, which can lead to stabilization of the RNA in the cell (Bonafe et al., 2005). Interestingly, down-regulation of GAPDH inhibited TBSV replication in yeast and in plants and resulted in the production of (+) and (\u2013)RNAs in a 1:1 ratio, instead of the hallmark asymmetric RNA synthesis. Thus, the replication of TBSV became double-stranded RNA virus like when only a limiting amount of GAPDH was present in the viral RC. Moreover, GAPDH was re-localized from the cytosol to the peroxisomal membrane surface, the site of TBSV RNA synthesis. Based on in vitro and in vivo data, it has been proposed that GAPDH promotes asymmetric RNA synthesis by selectively retaining the (\u2013)RNA template in the viral RC, thus allowing efficient access of the (\u2013)RNA replication intermediate to the viral RC. On the contrary, (+)RNA progeny, which are not bound by GAPDH, get released from the RC into the cytosol (Wang and Nagy, unpublished). Thus, a cellular metabolic enzyme can regulate asymmetric viral RNA synthesis, explaining this hallmark feature of (+)RNA viruses.",

In addition to the viral replication proteins, host proteins are also predicted to participate in regulation of sgRNA synthesis. Accordingly, Hardy and his colleagues found that hnRNP-K, a predominantly nuclear poly(C)-binding protein with 3 KH RNA-binding domains, co-precipitated with the SIN sgRNA, but not with the gRNA (Burnham et al., 2007). hnRNP-K also interacted with SIN nonstructural proteins and it was redistributed to the membrane fraction and co-localized with the SIN RC in infected cells. Interestingly, the amount of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is up-regulated in SIN-infected cells and MAPK-based phosphorylation of hnRNP-K can lead to cytosolic accumulation of hnRNP-K, suggesting that the MAPK pathway could be involved in the re-localization of hnRNP-K for SIN replication. Overall, the interaction of hnRNP-K with the sgRNA and the SIN nonstructural proteins might lead to up-regulation of the sgRNA synthesis that produces \u223cfourfold more sgRNA than gRNA (Burnham et al., 2007).",

If phosphorylation takes place reversibly, then the same RC could release the viral (+)RNA progeny (Fig. 14.1, step 5), followed by new rounds of RNA synthesis and release. The cellular kinase involved in phosphorylation of TBSV p33 might be protein kinase-C (PKC) like, based on in vitro experiments.
