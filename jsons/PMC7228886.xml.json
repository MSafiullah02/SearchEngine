            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has resulted in substantial ICU admissions and excess mortality worldwide. Similar to the SARS-CoV virus implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 facilitates cell entry by attaching to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) located on the cell surface [1]. ACE2 is present in multiple tissues and is highly expressed in the lungs and heart [2]. Given this distribution, it is unsurprising that Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and myocarditis are the primary causes of death in COVID-19 patients [3]. The cause of overwhelming inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 is unclear, however. One particular pathway that has been previously implicated in animal models of acute lung injury and myocardial injury is the p38 MAPK system [4,5]. Upregulation of the p38 MAPK pathway activates pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 [6]. Herein, we argue that the inflammatory injury provoked by SARS-CoV-2 may be due to a disproportionate upregulation of p38 MAPK activity. This inflammation may be attenuated by p38 small molecule inhibitors, many of which have been safely studied in clinical trials for other indications.",

            "text": "Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 binds and downregulates ACE2 upon cell entry [7]. ACE2 converts Angiotensin II (Ang II) into Angiotensin 1\u20137 (Ang 1\u20137), which then binds to the Mas receptor to counterbalance the vasoconstrictive and pro-inflammatory effects of Ang II [8,9]. Ang II mediates its effects through p38 MAPK activation [10]. Ang 1\u20137 stimulation of the Mas receptor decreases p38 MAPK activation to attenuate inflammation [11]. The loss of ACE2 activity upon viral entry may therefore allow Ang II mediated activation of p38 to predominate in the lungs and heart as Ang 1\u20137 is downregulated. This allows unchecked inflammation and produces a positive feedback loop as p38 activation also upregulates ADAM17, a protease known to cleave the ACE2 ectodomain to further reduce local ACE2 protective activity [12]. It is worth noting that while the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is still being fully elucidated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, a recent study found that inhibition of RAS via angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may reduce all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients [13]. In another study of COVID-19 patients, Ang II levels were linearly associated with degree of lung injury and viral load, further implicating RAS imbalance in the COVID-19 pathogenesis [14].",

It has been suggested that, among other functions, viral p38 MAPK activation induces endocytosis of viral receptors to facilitate cell entry [17]. Interestingly, p38 MAPK activation has been implicated in the endocytosis of ACE2 [18]. Given its homology to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 could use a similar mechanism to directly upregulate p38 MAPK. If this is the case, then SARS-CoV-2 could be propagating severe inflammation and organ damage by both directly upregulating p38 MAPK activity and downregulating a key p38 MAPK shut off mechanism by reducing ACE2 activity. Furthermore, p38 MAPK activation could simultaneously be propagating the SARS-CoV-2 viral lifecycle. Interestingly, a small preclinical study with a p38 inhibitor in SARS-CoV infected mice showed 80% survival in the treatment group (N = 5) and 0% in the control (N = 5) [19].",

There are reports of significant thrombotic events in severely ill COVID-19 patients, and a recent study in COVID-19 patients notes that the vascular endothelium is directly infected in target organs of SARS-CoV-2 [[20], [21], [22]]. Elevated p38 MAPK activity in the endothelium has been implicated in platelet aggregation, arterial thrombosis, and apoptosis of endothelial cells, a clinical finding also shown in the histology of the aforementioned study [23]. Cardiac dysfunction in COVID-19 patients could partly be due to this endothelial dysfunction, or due to overactivation of p38 MAPK in infected cardiomyocytes, which has been shown to induce apoptosis, impair contractility, and increase fibrosis [24]. Additionally, elevated p38 MAPK levels are implicated in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling, which are poor predictors of outcome in acute lung injury [25,26]. These effects are not entirely unexpected as excessive Ang II signaling, which transmits through p38 MAPK, also produces similar effects. However, in this instance, both direct viral activation of p38 MAPK and overactive Ang II p38 signaling may combine to create severe clinical complications.",

In 12 healthy volunteers, a single IV infusion of 3 mg of losmapimod and a subsequent 15 mg oral dose were safe and well-tolerated. Headache was the only adverse event reported more than once. Also reported were nausea, fatigue, dry mouth, neuralgia and nasopharyngitis. Nausea was the only adverse event thought to be drug related [27]. In a 28-day RCT comparing 7.5 mg of losmapimod twice daily versus placebo in hypercholesterolemic patients, losmapimod was well-tolerated and safe in 27 patients, with no serious adverse events. The most commonly reported side effect was headache and there were no differences between treatment groups in other safety data\u2014labs, vital signs, and ECG\u2014including liver function tests [28].

This combination may allow unrestrained p38 MAPK activity, promoting inflammation, vasoconstriction, and thrombosis, while simultaneously benefiting the viral lifecycle. As such, p38 MAPK inhibition may be an appropriate treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is supported by a small preclinical study of SARS-CoV infection in a mouse model. Further preclinical trials should be performed to elucidate the role of p38 activation in animal models of SARS-CoV-2.
