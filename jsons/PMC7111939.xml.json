It enters the host cell by binding of the spike (S) protein S1 domain to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV receptor (Li et al., 2003). Subsequently, the S2 domain fuses with the cellular membrane (Liu et al., 2004). ACE2 is a component of the renin\u2013angiotensin system and mainly involved in the regulation of heart function and blood pressure (Boehm and Nabel, 2002, Crackower et al., 2002). It is expressed in vascular endothelia, heart, kidney and testis, but also in epithelia of the small intestine and in alveolar epithelial cells (Donoghue et al., 2000, Hamming et al., 2004, Harmer et al., 2002). Recently it was shown that ACE2 also acts as a receptor for human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) (Hofmann et al., 2005).",

Treatment of SARS patients was mainly based on the use of ribavirin and corticosteroids, but the efficacy of these drugs has not been proven. Several groups have examined the antiviral effect of interferons (IFNs) against SARS-CoV. In vitro studies have shown that human recombinant IFNs inhibit SARS-CoV replication and that IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 combined have a synergistic antiviral effect against this virus (Cinatl et al., 2003, Morgenstern et al., 2005, Sainz et al., 2004). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that pegylated IFN-\u03b1 protected type-1 pneumocytes from infection with SARS-CoV in cynomolgous macaques (Haagmans et al., 2004). Usually IFNs achieve their antiviral effect through the induction of various proteins that block viral replication in the infected cell. To further explore the antiviral effect of IFNs and other cytokines specifically against SARS-CoV infection, we treated Vero E6 cells with various amounts of IFN-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 or interleukin (IL)-4 and infected these cells with SARS-CoV.",

While treatment with TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 1A) or IL-10 (data not shown) had no antiviral effect against SARS-CoV or HSV-1, pretreatment with IFN-\u03b3 (Fig. 1B) or a combination of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 1C) dose dependently reduced the number of infected cells per well after infection with either one of these viruses, as demonstrated previously (Cinatl et al., 2003, Feduchi et al., 1989). Surprisingly, recombinant human IL-4 also exerted SARS-CoV antiviral activity, which was not observed against HSV infection (Fig. 1D), suggesting a virus-specific antiviral activity. We also tested the antiviral activity of IL-4 against HCoV-NL63, another coronavirus that also uses the ACE2 receptor to enter the cell (Hofmann et al., 2005). Compared to untreated control cells, viral excretion from infected Vero E6 cells was reduced by more than 1 log after IL-4 treatment (Fig. 2\n).",

Removal of IL-4 conditioned medium from the Vero E6 cells after 48 h of treatment still conferred protection against SARS-CoV (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, when this IL-4 conditioned medium was transferred to fresh untreated Vero E6 cells and these cultures were infected 5 min later by adding 105 TCID50 SARS-CoV to the medium, no reduction in the number of SARS-CoV infected cells was observed (Fig. 3D). Therefore, the presence of a soluble SARS-CoV-infection blocking molecule, released by IL-4-treated cells, is unlikely. Because residual IL-4 was still present in this conditioned medium (not shown), IL-4 probably does not inhibit replication of SARS-CoV once it has entered the cell and needs to be added to the cells at an earlier time point. Thus, IL-4 most likely has an antiviral effect on an early step of the SARS-CoV life cycle in Vero E6 cells.",

As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment with IL-4 reduced the ability of Vero E6 cells to bind recombinant S protein. Because IFN-\u03b3 combined with TNF-\u03b1 also reduced susceptibility of Vero E6 cells to SARS-CoV, we analyzed binding of the S protein to these cells after IFN-\u03b3/TNF-\u03b1 treatment and demonstrated that 10 ng/ml IFN-\u03b3/TNF-\u03b1 reduced the binding capacity of the S protein to a background level (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that these cytokines influence expression of the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, ACE2.",

When IFNs bind to their receptors, downstream signaling from these receptors can block one or more steps in the virus life cycle. IL-4 on the other hand does not induce these proteins and may even antagonize the protective effects of IFN (Lohoff et al., 1990). In general, the Th2-derived cytokine IL-4 is not considered to display antiviral activity. In fact, only a few studies have demonstrated IL-4 mediated inhibition of viral replication (Goletti et al., 2002, Lin et al., 2003). Furthermore, expression of IL-4 by recombinant ectromelia virus or vaccinia virus exacerbated infection in vivo and the administration of recombinant IL-4 delayed virus clearance in influenza virus-infected mice (Jackson et al., 2001, Moran et al., 1996, Sharma et al., 1996). In this study, we demonstrate that treatment of Vero E6 cells with IL-4 decreased susceptibility of these cells to SARS-CoV infection by 10-to 100-fold. Interestingly, ACE2 expression on the cell surface was downregulated after treatment with IL-4 or IFN-\u03b3. Therefore, we postulate that IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 may decrease susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection partially through modulation of ACE2 cell surface expression. Cytokine-mediated downregulation of viral receptors has been reported earlier in the case of the coxsackievirus\u2013adenovirus receptor, which can be downregulated synergistically by IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in vitro (Vincent et al., 2004).",

Subsequent experiments revealed that ACE2 expression indeed is downregulated by IL-4.

Several studies have reported regulation of ACE2 expression, most likely related to its enzymatic activity. ACE2 protein expression is downregulated in the kidneys of hypertensive or diabetic rats (Crackower et al., 2002, Tikellis et al., 2003), whereas ACE2 upregulation has been demonstrated after blocking of the angiotensin II-receptors in the kidneys of rats during pregnancy, and in the human failing heart (Brosnihan et al., 2003, Crackower et al., 2002, Goulter et al., 2004, Ishiyama et al., 2004, Tikellis et al., 2003). Furthermore, it was recently shown that ACE2 is downregulated in the lungs of mice after acute lung injury, including SARS-CoV infection (Kuba et al., 2005). Most probably, ACE2 can be regulated by several different factors and expression of this protein is dynamic on various cell types. Recently it was reported that ACE2 expression is dependent on the differentiation state of epithelia; ACE2 was poorly expressed on undifferentiated airway epithelial cells, while it was abundantly expressed on well-differentiated cells (Jia et al., 2005). It will be of interest to study the effect of IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 on ACE2 expression on these cells.",

Treatment of Vero E6 cells with IL-13 on the other hand also downregulated ACE2, suggesting the involvement of the IL-4 type II receptor in the IL-4 induced antiviral activity. However, this hypothesis could not be further substantiated because antibodies against the IL-4 type II receptor tested were not reactive on non-human primate Vero E6 cells.",

Potentially, addition of cytokines able to downregulate ACE2 expression could further improve the efficacy of IFN-\u03b1 based anti SARS-CoV therapy. However, downregulation of ACE2 may have a potential negative effects on SARS pathogenesis, since it was recently reported that ACE2 has a protective role in acute lung failure in mice (Imai et al., 2005). Therefore it will be necessary to explore the consequences of ACE2 downregulation on SARS pathogenesis.",

The physiological relevance of the IL-4 induced antiviral activity may be limited because this cytokine is probably not produced in large quantities during natural SARS-CoV infection (Huang et al., 2005, Wong et al., 2004). However, vaccination strategies utilizing inactivated SARS-CoV or subunits in the presence of specific alum based adjuvants may skew immune response to TH2 or TH0, allowing the production of IL-4 upon restimulation (Spruth et al., 2006). The relevance of ACE2 expression modulation by IFN-\u03b3 in the pathogenesis of SARS and NL-63 CoV needs further investigation.",
