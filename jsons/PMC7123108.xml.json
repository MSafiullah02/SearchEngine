            "text": "For many years, mushrooms have been considered as important food based on its rich nutritional value. In addition, different mushrooms showed high potential application in medical applications. (El Enshasy et al. 2013) and pharmacological (Wasser 2002; Elenshasy 2010; El Enshasy et al. 2013). The \u201c Chinese caterpillar fungus\u201d, is one of the conventional medicinal mushrooms. This fungus attacks and expands inside a particular insect and kills the host in the later stage. During the time of winter passing inside the insect, the fruituning body grows on the surface of the corpse. However, there are numerous known types of Chinese caterpillar growths, which fit in with numerous distinctive such as , and . One of the well-knownCordyceps species which is the, Cordyceps sinensis, become a parasite on the larvae of , been utilized to initiate the longevity, soothe fatigue and kill various ailments as Chinese traditional medicine (Pegler et al. 1994; Zhu et al. 1998; Buenz et al. 2005). Later contemplates showed that different species showed numerous pharmacological activities and showed potential application as (Leung et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2007; Lin and Chiang 2008; Lee et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2010; Choi et al. 2011; Jeong et al. 2011) antioxidant (Wang et al. 2005; Ramesh et al. 2012; Ren et al. 2012;), (hypoglycemic) (Yun et al. 2003; Ma et al. 2015), (Mizuno 1999; Won and Park 2005; Jeong et al. 2010; Choi et al. 2014), and immunomodulator (Ng and Wang 2005; El Enshasy & Hatti-Kaul, 2013; Jeong et al. 2013; Yao et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2015; Lee et al. 2015; Peng et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015;). Further investigations for isolation of bioactive molecules from this type of fungus showed that that low molecular weight compound, cordycepin is one of the potent active molecules with many biotherapeutic activities (Cunningham 1951; Suhadolnik and Cory 1964; Fujita et al. 1994; Kiho and Ukai 1995; Bok et al. 1999; Li et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2004a; Yu et al. 2004b; Yalin et al. 2006).",

The cordycepin will be converted into 5\u2032-mono, di and triphosphates and thus hinder the movement of ribose-phosphate pyrophospho kinase and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase in the de novo purines biosynthesis and/or the nucleic acids synthesis causing the antimetastatic, antitumor and antimicrobial results (Overgaard-Hansen 1964a; Rottman and Guarino 1964; Cory et al. 1965; Rich et al. 1965; Ahn et al. 2006; Yoshikawa et al. 2004; Nakamura et al. 2005). In addition, cordycepin with its antileukemic ability normally join with adenosine deaminase inhibitor and this will cause the inhibitoryn effect to take place which help to analogues of 2\u2032, 5\u2032- oligoadenylate towards the human immunodeficiency virus infection (Muller et al. 1991; Kodama et al. 2000;). Large scale culturing of mycelial through synthetic can be used a s a new source of cordycepin due to its limited amount in natural source. Tow stage control of dissolved oxygen or addition of NH4+ to the can help to improve the production of cordycepin (Mao and Zhong 2004, 2006). In addition to production using fermentation technology, cordycepin could be also produced chemically. However, chemical synthesis has some limitation such as complication of the process and the utilization of large volume of organic solvents which decrease the attractiveness of this process (Hansske and Robins 1985; Aman et al. 2000).",

It was watched that restraint of polyadenylation by cordycepin of some m-RNAs made them touchier than alternate mRNAs. At higher dosages, Cordycepin represses cell connection and lessens focal attachment. Further rise in the usage of cordycepin may terminate mTOR (mammalian focus of rapamycin) signaling pathway (Fig. 16.4) (Wong et al. 2009). The name mTOR has been determined from the medication rapamycin, on the grounds that this medicine represses mTOR action. The mTOR inhibitors, for example, rapamycin and CCI-779 have been tried as anticancer medicines, on the grounds that they repress or block mTOR pathway. mTORcan be defined as 298 kDa serine/threonine from the family PIKK (Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase) . The mTOR assumes an extremely imperative part to direct proteins production. Be that as it may, mTOR itself is controlled by different sorts of cell indicators such as factors of growth, nutritional environment, hormones, and energy level for cellular. As growth factor tie with cell receptor, Phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) gets initiated, changes over phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidyl inositol trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 further initiates PDK1 (phosphoinositide subordinate protein kinase 1). The actuated PDK1 then phosphorylates AKT 1 kinase and makes it somewhat initiated which is further made completely enacted by mTORC2 complex. The activated AKT 1 kinase now actuates mTORC1 complex that prompts the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 (translational repressor) and makes it inactive, exchanging on the protein production (Wong et al. 2009). The study confirmed that during the low level of nutrutional stress affirmed, Cordycepin actuates AMPK, which hinders the action of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by some obscure component. The inactivated mTORC2 complex cannot enact AKT 1 kinase completely, which inhibits mTOR signal transduction hindering translation and more cell expansion and development (Fig. 16.4) (Tuli et al. 2014b).",

Therefore, circular and fluorescent dichroism as well as molecular docking measurements performed. The results showed the direct interaction of cordycepin with AMPK \u03b31 subunit. However, knock down of AMPK\u03b31 by siRNA and inhibition of AMPK\u03b31 expression has reported as significant factor leading abolishment of cordycepin actions in the lipid regulation especially in hyperlipidemia. Finally, cordycepin was introduced as promising agent to inhibit intracellular lipid accumulation by activating AMPK through the interaction with \u03b31 subunit (Wu et al. 2014).",

Low cytotoxic effect was shown by the fungal extract from the hot water extraction towards the B16 melanoma cells in culture (about 25% inhibition) but significant antitumor effect in animal tests, that cause 50% inhibition on the B16 cell-induced tumor growth in mice. Major bioactive compounds like cordycepin and polysaccharides of Cordyceps sinensis, can be found in mycelium biomass and the mycelium extract had significant antitumor activity. The Cs-HK1 fungus was introduced as a new and promising medicinal fungus and as an effective and good substitute of economical of the wild Cordyceps sinensis for health care (Leung et al. 2006).

(2010). In addition, the cordycepin secretion results on phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) activation induced by LPS was studied. After LPS stimulation, Pro-inflammatory cytokine production, nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was sensed in BV2 microglia. However, significant inhibitory effect of cordycepin on the extreme production of PGE2, pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO in a concentration-dependent manner without producing cytotoxicity was reported. In addition, cordycepin illustrated the suppressing effect on NF-\u03baB translocation by blocking the degradation of IkappaB-\u03b1 (I\u03baB-\u03b1) and inhibition of Akt, ERK-1/2, JNK, and p38 kinase phosphorylation. Results presented that cordycepin inhibition on LPS-stimulated inflammatory mediator production in BV2 microglia is related to Akt, NF-\u03baB, and MAPK signaling pathway suppression. Therefore, authors proposed cordycepin as useful agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by inflammatory mediator production inhibition in activated microglia (Jeong et al. 2010).",

Furthermore, the expression of surface markers on T lymphocytes, the proliferative response and the effect of cordycepin on the expression of interleukin-10 mRNA were evaluated completely. In addition, cytotoxicity of cordycepin, interleukin-10-secreting cells and the impact of anti-interleukin-10 neutralizing antibody were assessed. Results showed that cordycepin has an expressively up-regulative impact on the interleukin-10 production and interleukin-10 mRNA expression. Moreover, Cells of CD8+, CD4+, CD56+, CD14+ and CD19+ were confirmed as Interleukin-10-producing cells. In parallel, Proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells cordycepin and phytohaemagglutinin-induced interleukin-2 production was inhibited considerably. It is reported that decrease in expression of the surface markers CD45PRO, CD25, CD71, CD54 and HLA DR also reflected restricted T lymphocyte activation. Furthermore, Anti-interleukin-10 neutralizing antibody was reported, as component not completely hindered the cordycepin suppressive effect on production of interleukin-2. Authors stated an effective concentration (above 24 \u03bcg/ml) of cordycepin, which presented minor cytotoxicity but did not raise apoptosis. In contrast, high cordycepin concentration was stated as it may have exerted widely inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis or caused in cytotoxicity remarkably. However, in range of cordycepin concentration between 0 and 24 \u03bcg/ml, the strong up-regulation of interleukin-10 expression and immediate down-regulation of interleukin-2 expressions signified that an inhibitory result on or a mechanism might not be essential. Results indicated that cordycepin uses immunoregulativeoutcomes. Additional study on the method for the improvement of novel immunomodulatory medicines, which precisely adjust the excretion of cytokines, was suggested (Zhou et al. 2002).",

Of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and cytosolic freeCa2+ ([Ca2+]i), as two aggregation-inducing molecules, up to 74% of up-regulation of [Ca2+]i was blocked with cordycepin (500 \u03bcM) while for TXA2 production, it was suppressed by 46%. Afterward, phosphorylation of Ca2+- for 20-kDa and 47-kD aproteins in collagen treated platelets was effectively reduced by by cordycepin.

Thus, electroencephalogram (EEG) was applied in order to record the sleep about 4 h later than cordycepin oral administration by rats. Analyses on the sleep structure and EEG effect spectra were performed. As a result, Cordycepin diminished wake cycles of sleep and expanded non rapideye movement (NREM) rest. Fascinatingly, cordycepin expanded (theta) waves force density throughout NREM rest. Furthermore, AR subtypes (A2A, A1 and A2B) protein levels were risen later the cordycepin consumption, particularly in the rodent hypothalamus which assumes a vital part in regulation of sleep. Subsequently, authors prescribed that cordycepin grows theta waves force density throughout NREM rest through nonspesifiv AR in rats. Authors declared that results were presented to give fundamental proof that cordycepin may be accommodating for sleep-bothered issues (Hu et al. 2013).",
