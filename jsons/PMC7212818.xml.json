Although the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) were associated with much higher respective case fatality rates (CFRs of 9.6% and 34.4%, respectively), the COVID-19 pandemic has led to more deaths due to the large number of individuals infected. Human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) virus has become the primary transmission route of the disease [2]. In this context, policymakers need to weigh the risks of inaction and pursue policies and strategies commensurate with the magnitude of the threat.",

Here, we share experiences of a multimodal telemedicine network in Sichuan Province in Western China during the COVID-19 pandemic. The network synergizes a newly established 5G service, a smartphone app, and an existing telemedicine system. The Sichuan telemedicine network was activated immediately after the first COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020 (Figure 1). Disaster response funds have been used to pay directly for telehealth care in the short term through a contingency contract with a telehealth network. It capitalized on the remote capabilities of staff and technology and likely played an important role during the pandemic.",
