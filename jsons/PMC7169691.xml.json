            "text": "Carnivore parvoviruses are a group of very closely related viruses that infect wild and domestic carnivores, inducing a variety of clinical forms. These may range from subclinical infections to severe, often fatal disease characterized by loss of appetite, depression, fever, leukopenia and haemorrhagic gastroenteritis. In addition to feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) and canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV\u20102), which have been known since 1920s and late 1970s, respectively, additional parvoviruses have been detected in wild carnivores (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012b). Currently, carnivore parvoviruses are members of the genus Parvovirus (family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae) and are considered as host variants of a unique viral species, Feline panleukopenia virus (http://ictvdb.bio-mirror.cn/Ictv/fs_parvo.htm).",

However, while the latter virus has retained a certain genetic stability (Decaro et al., 2008), CPV\u20102 has displayed a more complex evolutionary history, which is quite uncommon for a DNA virus (Decaro et al., 2009). Soon after CPV\u20102 emergence, two antigenic variants, CPV\u20102a and CPV\u20102b, replaced the original type, giving rise to additional mutants in different countries (Truyen, 2006). A further variant, designated as CPV\u20102c, was first detected in Italy (Buonavoglia et al., 2001) and subsequently spread to other countries (Decaro et al., 2007a, 2011; Hong et al., 2007; Perez et al., 2007; Calderon et al., 2009; Nandi et al., 2009; Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2012a).",

The DNA from each sample was extracted from the homogenates by boiling 200 \u03bcl of the supernatant for 10 min and chilling on ice. To reduce residual inhibitors of DNA polymerase activity to ineffective concentrations, the DNA extracts were diluted 1 : 10 in distilled water (Decaro et al., 2005, 2006a). The extracted DNAs were tested by a TaqMan assay, which is able to recognize all carnivore parvoviruses (Decaro et al., 2005). Real\u2010time PCR was performed using an i\u2010Cycler iQ\u2122 Real\u2010Time Detection System (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories Srl, Milan, Italy), and the data were analysed with the iCycler IQ detector software (version 3.0). Duplicates of the CPV standard dilutions and DNA templates were simultaneously subjected to real\u2010time analysis. The 25\u2010\u03bcl PCR mixture for one reaction contained 12.5 \u03bcl of Supermix 600 nm of primer CPV\u2010For (5\u2032\u2010AAACAGGAATTAACTATACTAATATATTTA\u20103\u2032) and CPV\u2010Rev (5\u2032\u2010AAATTTGACCATTTGGATAAACT\u20103\u2032), 200 nm of probe CPV\u2010Pb (5\u2032\u2010FAM\u2010TGGTCCTTTAACTGCATTAAATAATGTACC\u2010TAMRA\u20103\u2032), and 10 \u03bcl of DNA. The following thermal cycling protocol was used: activation of DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, 40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, primer annealing at 52\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 60\u00b0C for 1 min. The internal control consisted of exogenous DNA, extracted from Ovine herpesvirus 2 (Decaro et al., 2004). For parvovirus characterization, a panel of minor groove binder (MGB) probe assays able to discriminate between CPV/FPLV, CPV\u20102a/2b, CPV\u20102b/2c and CPV vaccine/field viruses was used. The specificity and sensitivity of all molecular assays used in the study had been previously calculated (Decaro et al., 2005, 2006a,b, 2007b).",
