In 1999, the American College of Critical Care Medicine stated that patients with hematological or metastasized oncological malignancies are poor candidates for ICU admission with a mortality rate of up to 90%. Thus, refusal of ICU admission of these patients was the common procedure (Task Force of the American College of Critical Care Medicine, Society of Critical Care Medicine, 1999 [2]). However, within the last 25 years, cancer and ICU treatment clearly improved. As shown in recent reports, hospital mortality decreased to less than 40% in these critically ill patients with hematologic malignancies [3]. Thus, criteria for ICU admission have to be adjusted. Aim of this consensus statement is to provide a review of the recent literature and the development of practical recommendations to hematologists, oncologists, and intensive care specialists. Due to a series of practice-changing investigations on proper ventilation techniques in cancer patients with acute respiratory failure, we put a special emphasis on discussing this topic.",

The authors suggested to offer these patients a full-code ICU trial with re-evaluation of the goals of therapy after at least 6 days [9]. We would like to point out that almost all patients who died after day 5 had treatment-limitation decisions. Therefore, it remains unknown what their course would have been in case of further full-code management. Furthermore, data on cancer patients with poor prognosis suggest that the optimal duration of time-limited ICU trials seems to differ largely between patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies [11]. Thus, proposing a fixed interval from admission to re-evaluation of the goals of ICU therapy in patients undergoing time-limited ICU trials may not be generally appropriate.",

This effect might be linked to expertise and specific processes of care. However, some of the available observational studies may not have accounted for potential confounders related to ICU organization, structure, and process of care. Ultimately recognizing and developing \u201ccritical care of cancer patients\u201d as a medical subspecialty may optimally serve the needs of affected patients [25]. Nevertheless, due to the fast-growing demand for critical care for cancer patients, the major practical challenge is how to provide high-quality and affordable care for all patients. Treating all critically ill cancer patients regardless of the underlying condition in specialized centers may not be feasible after all. Therefore, managing some of the rather common cancer-specific ICU problems, such as neutropenic sepsis, should become part of routine expertise for all intensive care specialists. However, in more specific situations, such as chemotherapy administration in critically ill patients with aggressive hematologic malignancies or caring for ICU patients after allogeneic stem cell transplant, transfer to specialized centers should be discussed.",

Infections, malignancy itself, and drugs are major triggers for these sepsis-mimicking syndromes. Diagnostic vigilance for early recognition is essential to reduce mortality. To validate diagnosis, we recommend to include blood differential (cytopenia, eosinophilia), ferritin, soluble IL2R, fibrinogen, and triglycerides in addition to the routine ICU lab admission panel in cancer patients with sepsis or sepsis-like syndromes in whom there is no apparent focus of sepsis [90, 91] (see Table 6 for HLH diagnostic criteria). Withholding the assumed trigger drug and immediate search for an underlying malignancy or infection are pivotal. HLH patients require immediate immunosuppression with corticosteroids to prevent further progression of organ failure [92]. Early consultation with an HLH expert to stratify treatment according to the most likely trigger is recommended (www.hlh-registry.org).",

From recently published data, we conclude that the severity of the acute illness is more important with regard to short-term survival than the underlying type and stage of malignancy. Patients receiving intensive treatment of their malignancy should be considered for ICU treatment as other severely ill patients without cancer. Centers should establish local admission criteria for critically ill cancer patients as well as standardized admission procedures, such as joint assessment by cancer specialists and intensivists, allowing identification of patients and standardized transfer to the ICU. In some patients, time-limited ICU trials with pre-defined do-not-escalate decisions (e.g., do-not-intubate or do-not-attempt-resuscitation) may be an adequate option until final decision. This implements that critically ill cancer patients should be referred to experienced intensive care units. We strongly recommend establishing a local structure with daily joint rounds of cancer specialists and intensivists as well as standard-operating procedures for the management of frequent medical conditions in critically ill cancer patients.",
