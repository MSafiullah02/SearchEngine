Using a case study of Mexico, it reviews the effects on the environment and the human well-being of the dominant economic model based on wasteful fossil energy, social inequality, consumerism, fashion, and growth concentrated in small elites. This model has brought both the planet and society as a whole to its limits of survival, but it has also affected regions, cultures and social classes differently. Poor countries and vulnerable groups have become the main victims suffering from socio-economic and climate-induced changes. In Mexico, the epidemiology has been changing, and traditional illnesses ( diarrhoea, pulmonary conditions, under-nourishment) coexist with modern ones linked to the transformation of the diet (diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancer) and the pollution of water, air and soil (intoxication, respiratory, kidney and skin problems).",

It also investigates the effects of deteriorated environmental services, safe water supply, permanent and culturally accepted food, and how all these processes influence a sustainable health system at affordable costs. In the longer term, the restoration of environmental services and the integration of traditional and modern knowledge are crucial for granting water, food and health security. In a scenario of severe future climate change impacts, humankind, international society and the business community, as well as the community of states and international organisations, will have to face many challenges to their well-being and survival, which may be more severe than any security threat that states have so far experienced.",

It introduces the evolution of the health and water security concept and both will be discussed in the context of the widening, deepening, and sectorialisation of security concepts. Part three deals with climate change and its impacts on health and water security in Mexico, which are explored with the PEISOR model. Part 4 discusses climate impacts on highly marginal groups and their social vulnerability. The next subchapter explores the restoring of ecosystem services and its effects on health and water security. The concluding part suggests a dual scientific and policy-orientated complex analysis of water and health security with greater equity that combines bottom-up initiatives of water conservation and health practices (often traditional ones) with top-down strategies of water management and health\npolicies (WASH), where the research questions are discussed in a conceptual security framework.",

What are the health and societal outcomes of the changing water security in Mexico and how are highly socially vulnerable people being affected by these unknown security threats? What are the policy responses at national and international level to the changing water security challenges due to massive and partly environmentally forced migration (Oliver-Smith 2009a, b; Renaud et al. 2007) and to the new health security threats, such as pandemics (Rodier/Kindhauser 2009; Rosenberg/Krafft 2009)? How may integrated bottom-up and top-down policies improve the situation of human, gender and environmental security, thus creating a HUGE security (Oswald Spring 2007b, 2009b)?",

In environmental terms, water security refers to maintaining the ecosystem services and protecting the biological and hydrological cycles and the ecosphere (Brauch/Oswald Spring 2009; Steffen et al. 2004). Water is also a key element of societal security that permits livelihood, recreation, and joy of life. In policy terms, adaptation, mitigation, preventive learning, and early warning processes may avoid hydrological deterioration at basin level and disastrous outcomes from extreme hydro-meteorological events (Seung-Ki et al. 2011).

When taken into account, it may offer freedom from fear (Human Security Report 2005), freedom from want (Ogata/Sen 2003), freedom from hazard impacts (Bogardi/Brauch 2005; Brauch 2005b; Oswald Spring 2011), and freedom to live in dignity, with justice and equity for all social groups everywhere on earth (Annan 2005; Sen 1995). Therefore, health security (Oswald Spring 2010b) is intimately related to human, environmental and especially to water security (Oswald Spring/Brauch 2009), including sustainable management of the environment (Bookchin 1988). As a holistic policy, it combines four key concepts for a desirable future: sustainability, development, security and health. Such an integrated strategy may offer both a conceptual framework and guidelines for translating anticipatory learning into proactive policies and measures: a strategy of sustainable development combined with a vision of sustainable health. In synthesis, this represents the vision or policy perspective of a combined human, gender and environmental security concept or of a HUGE\n2 policy approach to security.",

Later, with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the AH1N1 or in 2020 Coronavirus influenza strain, the outbreaks of pandemics were integrated into its health security agenda and goals. The declaration by WHO of a global pandemic emergency has had severe effects on the economy and on jobs in some affected countries.3 This state-centred understanding of health security included recommendations to combat the pandemic with a global vaccination and strict hygienic practices to prevent global spread of the pandemic, along with developing specific drugs to combat the concrete illness. Related to a military and political security approach, policy-makers in industrialised countries emphasised the protection of their population against external threats, unknown epidemics (WHO 2002b, c, d) and terrorism. This narrow understanding of health security was globally promoted by WHO (2003) at the request of and in close consultation with many industrialised countries. Poor countries were confronted with new political pressures to buy drugs and vaccines to fight against these pandemics (most of them are protected by patents under WTO rules and therefore expensive), while other more urgent health issues could not be funded due to limited financial resources, such as safe water and basic sewage water sanitation.",

This second approach focuses on the interrelationship between human health and environmental services as important health providers (MA 2005) and expresses the crucial relationship between water and health security (Cort\u00e9s/Calder\u00f3n 2011; Avelar et al. 2011). Critics observe that in the dominant approach to health security and health policy, the state-centred position does not attribute sufficient attention and resources to the other six billion primarily poor people, who still lack access to affordable health care. Their approach concentrates on the limited financial health resources in poor countries, where the sole state-centred effort lacks an integral health care system. Further, the environment and water and vector-borne diseases in particular play a crucial role in maintaining and recovering human health (Hansen/Corzo 2011).",

The economic outcomes have been a drastic reduction in the income of the nation state and a smaller public budget for social support and public work on health and water issues. On the other hand, they are increasing the costs of basic services for poor customers (Barkin 2011), and in precarious economies the higher costs compete directly with the food intake and thus have negative impacts on the immune system and personal and collective health.",

After the Cold War, as a logical consequence, a reduction in the arms trade was expected, with the potential to reallocate the resources from weapons to social improvements. However, the contrary occurred, and in 2011 more than US$ 1.3 trillion were spent on arms and the military (SIPRI 2010). The political instability of post-colonial countries has pushed these unstable regimes to increase their defence budget by further shrinking the limited social investments to mitigate extreme poverty and hazard-affected regions. Additionally, the illegal international arms trade and the proliferation of small arms worldwide have created even more complex social conditions. All these factors reduce the amount of public expenditure, but also the personal spending for improving public and personal water and health security. In addition, due to the effects of climate change, its impacts on the people and the environment are complex, and concrete outcomes may differ in each geographical region.

Besides the southern and south-eastern part (states of Puebla, Veracruz, Tabasco, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Campeche, Yucat\u00e1n and Quintana Roo) being the poorest region in terms of GDP, it is the richest in biodiversity, environmental services and natural resources (Fig. 15.4). The average temperature is 22 \u00b0C and less than 10% are mountain areas with lower temperatures (between 10 and 18 \u00b0C). The subsoil is rich in oil, carbon, sulphur, fluorite and gas, and Mexico\u2019s most biodiverse fauna and flora are located there because the region gets half of the country\u2019s precipitation in only one quarter of its surface area (Tamayo 2002: 17\u201323). Nevertheless, the temporary abundance of water in this region is also creating security challenges due to floods, storms and flash-floods, which seriously affect water, health and livelihood security. The desperate situation is further triggered by the lack of regional development, limited early warning policy and a historical institutional discrimination of this mostly indigenous population. Eighty-four per cent of extreme poor people live in this region. The Index on Human\nDevelopment (IHD) in Oaxcaca is 0.698, and in Chiapas and Yucat\u00e1n of 0.762 because one third of the population are without a stable income (Presidencia de la Rep\u00fablica 2010). These societal outcomes are further analysed in relation to the existing social vulnerability (Coneval 2010) and the new climate change impacts.\n",

In 2014, around half the population (55.3 million) lived in poverty (Coneval 2015) and 84.6% was malnourished, mostly through obesity resulting from the limited availability of nutritious fresh food and consequent reliance on calorific processed products (Ensanut 2012).

Biodiversity loss (for instance, during the 1980s the state of Tabasco destroyed about 92% of its tropical rain forest) and the bleaching of coral reefs due to greenhouse gas emissions, acidification of the oceans, and pollution of rivers, lakes and the sea are increasing risks during an extreme event. But landfills and open dumps of garbage also cause direct health impacts though vectors, toxic lixiviation and the development of insects, mice, rats and other dangerous fauna. Floods, heat waves, cold spills, water shortages, landslides, increasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and intoxication of ecosystems and humans related to pollutants (POPs, organic toxics and emerging organic compound; Cort\u00e9s/Calder\u00f3n 2011) are directly affecting health and water security. There also exist ecosystem-mediated impacts, such as the alteration or emergence of risks of infectious diseases. Reduced crop yields associated with poverty, soil depletion, and ignorance have increased malnutrition and the debilitation of the immune system. People get infections and diseases more easily and recover slower. The loss of traditional medicines and the elimination of long-established medical practices, together with a reduction in health personnel as a result of privatisation processes, are creating new vulnerabilities, especially in rural areas and among poor people.",

Member states of the WHO should reconsider their narrow and state-centred heath security concept and shift to a human-centred focus, including basic preventive and curative health care, especially the delivery of basic health services and reproductive health at local level. Practical education on nutrition, control on advertising of junk food, and taxes on soft drinks with high levels of sugar may drastically reduce the overweight, diabetes, cancer and degenerative illnesses related to the global model of consumerism. The combination of traditional and modern medical and environmental knowledge and the training of local people may support such an integral preventive health strategy in favour of the wellbeing of the people and the restoration of their ecosystems, through which water security is also improved.",

On the top of the policy agenda is water security in terms of a safe water supply for everybody as a basic human right. This signifies that a rational management must take into account the increasing scarcity of the resource, due to population growth, different hygienic conditions, new development processes and climate change. Agriculture is not only wasting water in irrigation, but also creating diffuse pollution and seawater intrusion into aquifers. In Mexico, the primary sector represents an important potential for saving water, and green agriculture not only helps to restore polluted resources, but would also improve ecosystem services with positive effects on health and water security.",

Efficient land planning may be able to re-establish the equilibrium among ecosystem services, development processes, recreation, population growth, environmental fragility, urbanisation and the recovery of ecosystems. Mexico is highly exposed to climate change-related risks, which will increase substantially, and health and water security can get lost without preventive policies.",

There is only one Earth, and health security threats due to climate change, especially pandemics, spread fast across the globe, due to modern communicative means. Simultaneously, the lack of water security, extreme drought periods, and the loss of the rain-fed subsistence agriculture due to higher temperature and irregular rainfall may create massive forced migration into neighbouring countries, where better living conditions or food availability represent an additional push factor.",

Many societal actors, social movements, clubs, NGOs, and leaders have key functions to perform new policy goals for both sustainable development and peaceful solidarity.The three economic sectors: agriculture, industry and services, and the business community can play both an impeding as well as an innovative role towards sustainable development goals. Whether the business sector is only guided by greed and the profit motive or becomes a socially and ethically responsible innovative agent depends both on society and the political framework established by the state and the world community.The state and inter-state actors, such as international organisations, regimes, and networks, will remain crucial actors for creating policy guidelines, frameworks for innovative policies and measures aimed at and implementing the dual goal of sustainable development and sustainable peace.\n",
