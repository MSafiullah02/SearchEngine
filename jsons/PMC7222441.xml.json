These parasitic species have evolved sophisticated and highly integrated mechanisms to reside in the GI tract of the hosts [2]. GI nematodes can release certain factors, generally termed excretory-secretory (ES) products or proteins, by actively exporting or passively diffusing into the host environment to ensure survival [2, 3]. To date, the investigation of nematode ES proteins has been incorporated into taxonomic composition analysis, immunodiagnostic applications, and vaccine development [4]. Importantly, increasing attention has been paid to the immunomodulatory properties of ES proteins, with multitudinous findings demonstrating the selective immunosuppressive or regulatory effects of certain nematode products on host immune cells [5].",

Given its widespread occurrence and substantial morbidity among affected animals, haemonecrosis is one of the most economically important parasite diseases, representing a major constraint on the livestock industry worldwide, especially in tropical, subtropical and warm climatic zones [7]. H. contortus is transmitted via a complex life cycle involving three free-living larval stages and two parasitic stages. After oral ingestion by the host in contaminated pastures, the infective third-stage larvae (L3) moult into the parasitic fourth-stage larvae (L4) via an exsheathment process triggered by the gastric acidic environment and then develop into adults, causing severe pathology and normally inducing chronicity [8].",

Due to anthelmintic resistance and the increasing demands for drug-free animal production [10], a better understanding of the mechanisms by which adult worms regulate host immune responses to promote coexistence with hosts may contribute to the exploitation of novel control strategies against H. contortus infection. Importantly, accumulating evidence has revealed that an array of adult H. contortus ES proteins (HcESPs), for example, Hco-gal-m/f [11], HcSTP-1 [12], Miro-1 [13], and Hc-AK [14], contribute to the facilitation of immune evasion by suppressing the proliferation of host peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the production of protective cytokines.",

            "text": "Similar to other GI nematodes, host cellular immunity against H. contortus infection is associated with the establishment of a type 2 immune response characterized by the secretion of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13, as well as the development of a Th1-type immune response related to chronic infections [9]. As the regulators and the regulated at the host-parasite interface, T cells play pivotal roles against GI nematode infections. However, immunosuppressed hosts cannot generate persistent and effective anti-nematode immunity clinically due to the impairment of T cell functions. For instance, CD4+ Th2 responses were notably inhibited by myeloid-derived suppressor cells induced by primary Heligmosomoides polygyrus (HP) infection [15], and HP infection could also block T cell activation by promoting P-glycoprotein activity [16]. Moreover, recent studies demonstrated that ES products derived from GI nematodes contributed to suppressing host T cell responses, as exemplified by the inhibition of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation induced by Ancylostoma caninum and Toxocara canis ES proteins [17]. However, the exact role of T cells as putative key effector cells in H. contortus infection is still poorly understood, and the exact molecular basis of the regulation between T cells and HcESPs remains to be elucidated. Based on the stage-specific binding of HcESPs to host PBMCs in vivo [18] and the immunosuppressive effects of HcESPs on PBMCs in vitro [19], the aim of this study was to characterize the interactions between HcESPs and host T cells, as well as to elucidate the immunomodulatory potential of HcESPs in the T cell-mediated immune response. To our knowledge, this is the first proteomics-guided comprehensive investigation of the relevance of HcESPs to host key effector cells.",

Peripheral venous blood samples were obtained by venipuncture from these goats, and the isolation of goat PBMCs was conducted as previously described [21]. Total T cells were sorted from goat PBMCs by a magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) system (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA, USA) as described elsewhere [22]. Briefly, freshly isolated PBMCs were resuspended to a density of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mL in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Then, 1 \u00d7 106 PBMCs in 100 \u00b5L of staining buffer were incubated with 10 \u03bcL of mouse anti-bovine CD2 primary antibody (Bio-Rad Inc, Kidlington, UK), which was cross-reacted with goat T cells at room temperature for 30 min. After two washes, 1 \u00d7 107 total cells in 100 \u00b5L of staining buffer were labelled with 10 \u03bcL of anti-FITC MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) at room temperature for 15 min. Subsequently, the cell suspension was loaded on a MACS MS Column (Miltenyi Biotec) placed in the magnetic field of the MACS Separator (Miltenyi Biotec). The magnetically labelled T cells were retained in the column, while the unlabelled cells passed through the column. After removing the column from the MACS Separator, T cells were eluted as the positively selected cell fraction. The T cells were then resuspended to a density of 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco) and 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco). The viability of the T cells was > 95%, as assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test. The purity of isolated T cells was above 95%, as measured by flow cytometry.

            "text": "Blast2GO was used to identify the GO terms for the 114 ES proteins and 15 T cell binding receptors. Of these 114 ES proteins, 98 were annotated into 12 subcategories of cellular component terms. In contrast, 35 proteins were enriched in 14 subcategories of biological process terms, and 62 proteins were assigned to 20 subcategories of molecular function terms (Figure 2A). Consistent with previous proteomic analyses [18, 32, 33], serine-threonine/tyrosine protein kinases and histidine/tyrosine phosphatases were enriched in protein kinase/phosphatase activity subcategories in this study. Both protein kinases and phosphatases are key regulators of cellular functions and are particularly prominent in signal transduction and coordination involved in the cell cycle, cell survival, protein\u2013protein interaction, and inflammation [34, 35]. Notably, 67.5% of the identified ES proteins (n = 77) were enriched in binding activity terms, namely, ion binding, substrate compound binding, and nucleic acid binding. Proteins involved in these functions are normally associated with energy metabolism, signalling, and transcription [36\u201338]. As external stimuli, these exogenous proteins may bind to host T cells, interfere with the intracellular homoeostatic balance and disrupt multitudinous cellular functions. Additionally, among the GO terms of T cell binding proteins, cellular component terms were allocated to the extracellular space (n = 4) and integral component of membrane (n = 3) subcategories. Biological process terms were allocated to the DNA repair (n = 2), apoptotic process (n = 2) and immune response (n = 2) subcategories, and molecular function terms were grouped into the DNA binding (n = 3) and ATP binding (n = 2) subcategories (Figure 2B). In particular, as GO annotation revealed that T cell binding receptors were enriched in biological process terms associated with cell apoptosis and immunomodulation, which were mainly attributed to the functional annotation of FasL, it is likely that the external stimuli of HcESPs played a pivotal role in the regulation of T cell survival and growth, as well as the T cell immune response.",

Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that treatment with HcESPs dramatically promoted T cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner compared to the control group (P < 0.05) (Figure 3B). Concurrently, transcriptional analysis of key genes in Fas-mediated apoptotic signal pathways further confirmed the induction of T cell apoptosis by HcESPs. Treatment with \u2265 20 \u03bcg/mL HcESPs significantly upregulated the mRNA transcripts of FasL (P < 0.05), Fas (P < 0.01), FADD (P < 0.05), BID (P < 0.0001), Caspase 3 (P < 0.05), Caspase 8 (P < 0.0001) and Caspase 9 (P < 0.001) (Figure 3C).

In a dose-dependent manner, treatment with HcESPs significantly inhibited the proliferation of T cells in vitro, as indicated by the decreasing percentage of cells in S phase compared with control cells (P < 0.05) (Figure 4A). Given that the treatment with 20 \u03bcg/mL HcESPs had significant biological effects on cell viability, apoptosis and proliferation, as well as the transcription of certain key genes, we next treated T cells with 20 \u00b5g/mL HcESPs for cell cycle determination. Flow cytometry analysis with PI staining revealed that HcESP stimuli induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in a time-dependent manner, as indicated by the increasing percentage of cells in G1 phase (P < 0.01) and the decreasing percentage of cells in S phase (P < 0.01) (Figure 4B). Consistent with the above findings, real-time PCR analysis of key genes in G1/S checkpoints and G2/M checkpoints showed that the transcription of CCND1 (P < 0.05), CCNE1 (P < 0.05), CDK4 (P < 0.05), CDK6 (P < 0.05) and CDK2 (P < 0.05) was significantly downregulated, whereas no significant transcriptional changes in CCNB1 or CDK1 were observed (Figure 4C). In addition, the transcription of essential genes in the Akt/PKB pathway that regulate cell proliferation and cell growth was also detected in this study. The transcripts of FoxO1 (P < 0.05), p21 (P < 0.05) and p27 (P < 0.05) were dramatically enhanced, while Akt1 transcription was significantly suppressed (P < 0.05) (Figure 4C).

The results showed that goat T cells exposed to HcESPs changed their cytokine production profile (Figure 5).

Yatsuda et al. identified 107 adult HcESPs recognized by anti-H. contortus serum for the first time [39], whereas Wang et al. recently characterized 878 unique proteins in ES products from different life-cycle stages [40]. Here, we identified 114 adult ES proteins that interacted with goat T cells through co-IP and LC\u2013MS/MS analysis. Notably, a cascade of proteolytic peptidases, including aspartic peptidases and metallopeptidases, was identified from these interacting ES proteins and is postulated to play crucial roles in larval development, adult survival and reproduction via the digestion or degradation of host haemoglobin [41, 42]. Similarly, comparable expression of these peptidase family members in ES products was reported in a series of blood-feeding nematodes, such as A. caninum [43], Necator americanus [44], and Ancylostoma ceylanicum [45]. Simultaneously, other essential molecules, e.g., C-type lectins (CLECs) and venom allergen-like proteins (VALs), were detected in the current study. As members of the lectin superfamily, CLECs engage in a diverse set of immune regulation processes by glycan binding and are as indispensable to nematode survival as the secretome [46, 47]. Given their wide distribution and potential binding with the host, CLECs have been speculated to be immunomodulators in parasite-host interactions or parasitic immune evasion [47]. In addition, recent studies reported abundantly secreted VALs in ES products that caused severe damage to host tissue, favouring the establishment of persistent infections during parasitism, and VALs could inhibit innate immune responses and remodel the extracellular matrix [48].",

Generally, death receptor ligands initiate signalling via receptor oligomerization, which in turn results in the recruitment of specialized adaptor proteins and activation of caspase cascades [31]. Regarding Fas-mediated signalling, Fas trimerization resulting from binding to FasL leads to recruitment of the initiator Caspase-8 via the adaptor protein FADD, inducing Caspase-8 oligomerization and activation via autocatalysis. Subsequently, activated Caspase-8 stimulates apoptosis by directly cleaving and activating Caspase-3 or alternatively cleaving Bid, which is a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein. Then, truncated Bid (tBid) translocates to mitochondria, facilitating the release of cytochrome c to activate Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 sequentially [50, 51]. In this study, HcESPs exerted modulatory effects on the transcript levels of several essential genes in the Fas-mediated death receptor pathway. The mRNA transcription of FasL, Fas, FADD, Bid, Caspase-3, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 was notably upregulated due to HcESP stimulation, indicating a potential mechanism of HcESP-induced intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis of T cells.",

            "text": "Cell apoptosis, the cell cycle, and cell proliferation are fundamental and ultimately linked processes. Analogous to its pro-apoptotic effects, HcESP stimuli repressed cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In eukaryotic cells, cell cycle progression is controlled by the G1/S checkpoint via CDK4/6-Cyclin D and CDK2-Cyclin E kinase complexes and the G2/M checkpoint via the Cyclin B-cdc2 (CDK1) complex [52, 53]. Here, PI/RNase staining results revealed that HcESP stimuli induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the commitment of T cells to enter from the G1/S phase into G2/M phase was prevented by HcESPs through the downregulation of CCND1, CDK4/6, CCNE1, and CDK2 transcription. The serine/threonine kinase Akt contributes to cell proliferation by phosphorylating the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27, both of which have direct inhibitory modification effects on CDK2 [54]. Akt also has multistep inhibitory modifying effects on Cyclin D via GSK-3\u03b2 [55]. Importantly, Akt is a major mediator of cell survival through direct inhibition of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad or inhibition of pro-apoptotic signals generated by transcription factors such as FoxO [56]. Based on these associations, we found that Akt1 transcription was significantly suppressed, whereas p21, p27 and FoxO1 transcription was strongly promoted, in HcESP-treated T cells. Given that FoxO1 induces apoptosis by upregulating the pro-apoptotic molecule FasL and CDK2 directly phosphorylates FoxO1 [57], the associations among FasL, FoxO1, CDKs, Cyclin proteins and Akt represent complex regulation by HcESP stimuli that can act via the alteration of mRNA transcription of key genes in the AKT/PKB pathway to mediate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Collectively, this could be the mechanism by which HcESPs regulate cell apoptosis, the cell cycle and the proliferation of goat T cells. However, due to the lack of available goat immune reagents, we only checked the expression of several key molecules at the transcription level in this study. Details regarding the regulation of these molecules at the protein level, along with the associated pathways, merit further investigation. As there is currently no literature revealing the physiological dose range of HcESPs, we employed serial dilutions of HcESPs (0, 10, 20, 40 and 80 \u00b5g/mL) for functional studies and demonstrated that 20 \u00b5g/mL was the best reference concentration that had a significant impact on cell viability, apoptosis, proliferation and the cell cycle. However, under the circumstance of natural infection, whether the accumulation of HcESPs in H. contortus-infected goats could reach this relevant dose (20 \u00b5g/mL) to induce notable suppression effects on T cells is still unclear, and further efforts are needed to validate this hypothesis.",

            "text": "Generally, immunomodulation by ES proteins of parasitic helminths has several predominant features: mediating Th2 responses as exemplified by the secretion of IL-4; inducing the generation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2; inhibiting lymphocyte activation; blocking pro-inflammatory and Th1 cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3; and regulating Treg and Th17 responses [4, 58]. Consistent with these findings, HcESPs significantly suppressed the secretion of IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3, indicating that HcESP stimuli exerted critical control effects on Th2 and Th1 responses. Although the reduced IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 secretion might be associated with the inhibition of cell viability and proliferation, we could not precisely determine IL-2/IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 production on a per cell basis here, and we could not determine the exact proportion of IL-2+/IL-4+/IFN-\u03b3+ T cells among total T cells. Thus, whether the reduction in IL-2/IL-4/IFN-\u03b3 production resulted from HcESP stimuli causing reduced numbers of live IL-2+/IL-4+/IFN-\u03b3+ T cells, reduced numbers of differentiated IL-2+/IL-4+/IFN-\u03b3+ T cells, or increased numbers of hyporesponsive IL-2+/IL-4+/IFN-\u03b3+ T cells remains unclear, and further efforts are needed to address this issue. In a previous study, a Galectin-9 homologue derived from adult Toxascaris leonina restrained inflammatory reactions by inhibiting Th1 and Th2 cytokine production by enhancing TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 production [59]. Similarly, a high dose of HcESPs also upregulated IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 secretion to inhibit the host inflammatory response. Additionally, TGF-\u03b2 induces apoptosis via death-associated protein 6 (DAXX), another binding receptor of Fas [60]. Therefore, increased TGF-\u03b21 secretion may exacerbate Fas-mediated apoptosis via a separate apoptotic pathway. Recent studies demonstrated the inhibition of Th17 differentiation and IL-17 secretion by Echinococcus granulosus and Acanthocheilonema viteae ES proteins [61, 62]. Instead, the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17A was notably promoted by HcESP stimuli in this study, indicating that HcESPs may not induce apoptosis of the Th17 subset. In addition, TGF-\u03b2 contributes to Th17 formation and IL-17 secretion [63, 64], and it is likely that increased TGF-\u03b21 production may function as the key factor to facilitate IL-17A production.",

However, the role of individual ES components is still being elaborated or has yet to be determined in most instances.
