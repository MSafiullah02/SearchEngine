Although viruses employ diverse strategies to control host cellular processes at the post-transcriptional level, the regulation of the gene expression is central to the virus\u2013host relationship (Kash et al., 2006a). Messenger RNA expression microarray methods that allow simultaneous measurement of tens of thousands of genes have greatly increased our ability to document and characterize these key interactions.",

            "text": "Regulation of host gene expression is especially important for RNA viruses, which have only a limited number of enzymatic activities encoded in their genomes, and therefore require a facilitative host environment for efficient replication. RNA viruses thus need to regulate their host gene expression environment to ensure an adequate supply of metabolites for RNA, protein and lipid biosynthesis for the production of new virions, while at the same time suppressing antiviral and cellular defense response pathways to prevent their detection and clearance by the immune system. Of primary importance to RNA virus replication is antagonism of the broad spectrum of antiviral activities associated with activation of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors and type I interferon (IFN) responses (reviewed in (Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006, Loo and Gale, 2007, Randall and Goodbourn, 2008, Sadler and Williams, 2008). However, over-strong viral antagonism and/or evasion of these responses can lead to very high rates of viral replication, significant inflammation and severe disease pathology. This is especially true of highly virulent RNA viruses, such as Ebola and pandemic influenza (Bray, 2001, Garcia-Sastre, 2001, Garcia-Sastre, 2004, Garcia-Sastre, 2006, Harcourt et al., 1999, Villinger et al., 1999).",

However, given the ability of RNA viruses to rapidly mutate, such countermeasures often lead to the development of drug resistance. One approach to help mitigate the impact of such mutations is the additional targeting of host responses to reduce pathogenesis. Multi-target therapies designed to limit viral replication and to mitigate immunopathology promise to greatly increase our capacity to combat viral diseases and improve human health. If highly virulent viruses dysregulate immune responses in the same manner, treatment modalities might be developed that target host response pathways common to many viruses. Moreover, drugs that modulate inflammatory responses could be used early in a critical care setting, before an accurate diagnosis can be made and virus-specific antiviral drugs can be administered.",

Moreover, they also are significant human pathogens with epidemic and pandemic potentials and are important areas of antiviral drug research.

Complementarily, studies in animal models can be used to investigate what might be called the \u201cdisease component\u201d of infection because they can reveal the whole infection process including immune cell-mediated effects. Thus, when combining the advantages of greater control of experimental variables in vitro with the biological relevance and complexity of in vivo models, studying the global host response using functional genomics promises to expand development of new antiviral drug targets and host immune responses for therapeutic intervention. This article does not aim to present a comprehensive review of microarray studies of RNA viral infections, but to describe how functional genomics technologies have increased our understanding of severe, acute viral infections in vitro and in vivo, using 1918 influenza and Ebola viruses as examples. How this approach can be further developed to promote the identification of novel and multi-target antiviral therapies will also be discussed.",

            "text": "A key requirement for successful protection against viral infection is the early detection of viral biomolecules and the activation of host responses to limit replication and activate the immune response. Central to this early warning system are the pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors (Saito and Gale, 2007). These include multiple families of proteins that sample both the extracellular and intracellular environments for a diversity of biomolecules, including lipoproteins, DNA and RNA. A second cornerstone of an effective antiviral response is the rapid triggering of a broad spectrum of antiviral activities by the PAMP receptors, such as the type I IFN response. Type I IFN refers to a large family of proteins composed of seven classes that includes 14 distinct IFN\u03b1 genes and 1 IFN\u03b2 gene (Pestka et al., 2004). Why humans encode so many distinct type I IFNs is unknown, but in general, IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 are the dominant antiviral IFN that are produced when cells are exposed to viral infection or dsRNA that trigger expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (Borden et al., 2007). An alternate activation pathway for expression of ISGs is mediated by type III IFN, or IFN-l that signal through heterodimeric IL-28R\u03b1/IL-10R\u03b2 to activate ISG expression (reviewed in Ank et al., 2006). Type III IFN has recently been shown to be an important component of antiviral responses in epithelial cells and to participate in the host response to influenza virus infection (Ank et al., 2008, Kotenko et al., 2003, Mordstein et al., 2008, Onoguchi et al., 2007, Osterlund et al., 2007, Sommereyns et al., 2008). At present the number of ISGs activated by stimulation of the type I IFN receptor is thought to be approximately 150\u2013200 unique genes. Interestingly, the mechanisms of action of only a handful of these key antiviral proteins are currently understood.",

Recently, an ER-associated trans-membrane PAMP receptor, called STING (stimulator of interferon genes), has been identified and shown to play an important role in innate antiviral responses (Ishikawa and Barber, 2008). Activation of these PAMP receptors by viral RNAs leads to the rapid activation of transcription factors, including IRF1, IRF3, IRF7 and NF\u03baB, synthesis of type I IFN proteins and subsequent expression of ISGs (Saito and Gale, 2007). Because of the potent antiviral defense properties of the IFN response, RNA viruses have evolved diverse strategies to either prevent activation of PAMP receptors, inhibit the signaling of the IFN receptor, limit ISG expression or evade ISG antiviral activity (Garcia-Sastre and Biron, 2006). For example, the influenza virus protein NS1 has several described activities, including antagonism of RIG-I, MDA5 and PKR, and inhibition of antiviral response pre-mRNA processing and translation (Hale et al., 2008, Kash et al., 2006a). Ebola viruses similarly encode proteins that greatly limit host cell IFN responses, including the inhibition of IFN response activation by the VP35 and VP24 proteins (Basler et al., 2000, Basler et al., 2003, Enterlein et al., 2006, Hartman et al., 2006, Hartman et al., 2008a, Reid et al., 2006).",

Interestingly, lungs from Tx91-infected mice also showed activation of cell cycle, glutathione metabolism and ATP generation related genes. This observation suggested that activation of these metabolic pathways could be important in preventing damage from reactive oxygen species and in stimulating tissue remodeling. In contrast, r1918 virus infection resulted in significant increases in expression of inflammatory response genes, such as IL6, IL12, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, CXCL1 and CXCl10, and additional genes associated with activation of immune cell populations during r1918 virus infection, including TH1 cells, NK cells, macrophages and neutrophils. These gene expression changes persisted in intensity from 24 h until death at day 4\u20135 p.i. and mirrored the severity of lung pathology. Additionally, r1918 virus infection resulted in the marked activation of many cell death-related genes, particularly those related to death receptor responses, including TRAIL, Fas, caspase-8 and caspase-9. These results suggested that inflammatory responses, reactive oxygen species generation and activation of cell death pathways might be important contributors to severe immunopathology associated with r1918 influenza virus infections.",

While infection with r1918 induced significant expression of immune response genes that occurred early (by 24 h) and persisted until death (day 5), Tx91 infection resulted in very limited expression of these genes in both intensity and duration. Moreover, the appearance and magnitude of up-regulated immune-related mRNAs could be correlated with virulence because the r1918 virus induced the highest and earliest expression of these genes, followed in magnitude and occurrence by 2:6 1918 then 5:3 1918. Moreover, pathway analysis of the expression array data revealed that infection with r1918 virus resulted in the most significant activation of death receptor, interleukin-6, Toll-like receptor and type I interferon responses. Previous studies had shown that the 1918 NS1 protein was a very potent antagonist of the type I IFN response (Geiss et al., 2002), and thus, it was surprising that significant induction of the type I IFN response, was observed as shown in Fig. 1. This robust expression of IFN-regulated genes in the lungs of infected mice, however, failed to inhibit viral replication and was unable to protect the host from the effects of 1918 influenza virus infection. It was hypothesized that this increased antiviral response gene expression associated with increased viral replication might be explained by (i) the heterogeneity of cell type and infection status of cells present in the lung, (ii) that only a small percentage of the cells are susceptible for sustained influenza virus infection and (iii) that a significant part of the host response gene expression would derive from the marked infiltration of activated immune cells. Taken together, these results suggested that over-activation of inflammatory responses may be contributing to the severity of highly pathogenic influenza virus infections and also that protecting cells from damage by immune cells, hypercytokinemia and oxygen radicals may limit tissue destruction and facilitate repair.",

Similar to the experiments with 1918 influenza virus in mouse lung, David Kelvin's group has recently used functional genomics to show marked activation of type I IFN responses was associated with highly virulent H5N1 influenza virus infection in ferret lung (Cameron et al., 2008). In particular, these studies showed robust lung expression of the IFN-regulated gene CXCL10 and its cognate receptor CXCR3. Kelvin's group then used this observation from their genomics data to perform an additional study where they treated infected ferrets with a CXCR3 antagonist (Amgen; AMG487) to quantify the role of this type I IFN-regulated pathway. Treatment of H5N1-infected ferrets with AMG487 reduced disease severity and delayed mortality of H5N1-infected ferrets showing that unregulated IFN responses were at least partially response for H5N1 disease severity in this model. This study illustrates the potential of functional genomics to identify host pathways that may be over-activated during highly virulent infections for which current inhibitory drugs have already been developed.",

Because these microarray experiments were performed on RNA isolated from infected lung tissues, the results give the average gene expression of cells in the entire tissue. Thus, in the end we are left with a lack of detailed knowledge as to the contributions that individual cell types, both infected and uninfected, make to the aggregate gene expression changes identified in the intact lung. However, these experiments raise exciting and fundamental new questions. Which populations of genes are expressed in which populations of cells? What is the contribution of infected and uninfected individual immune cell types to pathogenesis? How are infected cells that surround infected cells (i.e. \u201cbystander\u201d cells) affected by high cytokine levels in the tissue? Are the observed necrotic and cell death phenotypes triggered by the viral cytopathic effect (CPE) and limited to end-stage infected cells?

This cell type heterogeneity is further complicated during influenza virus infection, which results in the significant infiltration of numerous activated immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells and T and B lymphocytes (Perrone et al., 2008). Adding to this complexity is that approximately 15\u201320% of lung cells (i.e. the respiratory epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages) are susceptible to primary influenza virus infection. Therefore, the contribution of influenza viral replication in the respiratory epithelium to the overall transcriptional profile of whole infected lung is impossible to determine using an intact tissue model.

Another approach to reducing the confounding effects of cell heterogeneity is to isolate and study individual live cell populations using flow cytometry and fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). Similarly, laser capture microdissection (LCM) of fixed samples could be used to isolate specific cell populations to determine the gene expression profiles of infected cells and cells adjacent to infected and/or inflammatory cells.

However, in contrast to the infected cell expressing viral proteins that inhibit host responses, uninfected bystander cells do not contain such antagonists and are yet exposed to similarly high concentrations of cytokines, chemokines and activators of cells death. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that a portion of the respiratory epithelial cell necrosis associated with influenza virus infection may result from immune response-mediated bystander cell death. Studies designed to address such issues should provide important insights into pathogenesis and how cytokine responses may contribute to disease severity. Moreover, by characterizing the host response pathways responsible for loss of bystander cells, new treatment modalities, such as reducing damage by reactive oxygen species produced by neutrophils and macrophages, could be developed.",

In the absence of exogenous IFN, bioinformatic analysis showed many similarities in the expression of antiviral, and pro-inflammatory, coagulation and acute phase-related responses during ZEBOV and MARV infection. Most significantly, examination of the expression of antiviral response genes during infection in the presence of exogenous IFN\u03b1, revealed that ZEBOV and MARV strongly antagonized IFN responses. Of these two viruses, ZEBOV was the most potent inhibitor of type I IFN receptor responses and blocked activation of approximately 90% of the nearly 200 genes induced by IFN\u03b1 treatment of mock-infected cells; while MARV was able to inhibit approximately 75% of these IFN\u03b1-induced genes. These results showed that regulation of host responses and in particular antagonism of type I IFN responses were fundamental properties of these viruses and likely contribute to their ability to cause severe, acute disease in humans.",

These experiments showed that REBOV has a greatly reduced ability to inhibit activation of antiviral responses in human cells, most notably the type I IFN response.

Mutation of a key residue in the carboxy-terminus of VP35 (R312) has subsequently been found to abolish the IRF3 inhibitory activity of VP35 (Hartman et al., 2008a). The extent of the VP35-mediated antagonism of type I IFN responses has recently been explored using expression microarrays (Hartman et al., 2008b). In this study, Hartman et al, showed that infection of HepG2 cell cultures with a recombinant ZEBOV expressing the R312A mutant VP35 protein resulted in robust expression of many ISGs, including RIG-I, ISG15, IFIT1 and 2, MX1 and OAS that were not observed with wild-type ZEBOV. Thus, a single mutation in ZEBOV VP35 could abolish the global suppression of antiviral responses observed during wild-type Ebola virus infection in cell culture. However, an important limitation of these studies is that they were both performed in cell culture and could only address questions about the control and evasion of host and IFN responses during primary infection in an artificial environment and could not describe the true host environment of infection in the context of an intact immune response.

The authors concluded that the ZEBOV IFN antagonists VP24 and VP35 acted to influence the antiviral state of the infected cell rather than to inhibit the systemic IFN response.

Such studies have shown that type I IFN signaling regulates the expression of hundreds of genes that collectively establish an intracellular antiviral state, but the functions of the vast majority of these genes remain unknown (Sen and Sarkar, 2007). It is also likely that individual ISGs differ in their antiviral activity against different families of viruses. Thus, the characterization of type I IFN responsive genes and pathways is critical to further our understanding of broad-ranging effects of this key family of antiviral cytokines.",

Moreover, many of these genes were only regulated during 1918 virus infection and not during A/Tx/36/91 (Tx91) infection, suggesting they are associated with aberrant activation of inflammatory responses and immunopathology. Similarly, functional genomics can identify novel members of know antiviral pathways, including the type I IFN response, as shown in Fig. 4\n. This example, taken from published studies of type I IFN treatment in the absence or presence of Ebola or Marburg virus infection, reveals many mRNAs with unannotated or unknown identity/function whose abundance is increased upon type I IFN stimulation (Kash et al., 2006b). Moreover the IFN-induced expression of the many of these genes is inhibited during ZEBOV, but not REBOV infection in human cells suggesting these genes could be associated with human virulence of these viruses. These examples demonstrate that many immune-regulated genes and pathways remain to be identified and characterized and that microarrays are a useful method for uncovering new features of fulminant RNA viral infections.",

However, one major rate-limiting step in developing new host immune response targets for drug design is identification of new molecules/pathways whose activity reduces disease when modulated by therapeutic intervention, but does not have deleterious side effects. The high-throughput nature of expression microarrays allow for the identification of hundreds, if not thousands of infection responsive genes.

This article has discussed how global gene expression studies have be used to detail the global relationship between antagonism of host antiviral responses during severe fulminant RNA viral infection and how selective tissue sampling considerations can be developed to better characterize the activation of inflammatory cascades and the development of severe pathology. As the importance of immune cell activation, killing and immunopathology become more prominent, isolation of infected and/or immune cells from infected tissue or blood samples using FACS or LCM as a method to isolate specific cell populations for genomics analysis should become more widely used. Discovery-based genomics approaches can aid in identifying the host response pathways associated with immunopathology and contribute to a more detailed understanding of how global host responses are regulated during viral infection that will be critical for the development of novel antiviral treatments. Thus, an important goal for developing new antiviral therapies is the development of multi-target approaches that both inhibit viral enzymatic activities and limit the activation of deleterious immune responses associated with the development of immunopathology. While it may seem counter-intuitive to block host responses to infection, a limited and temporary inhibition of some host inflammatory response could provide additional protection against the development of severe disease pathology and improve clinical outcome. The strength of genomics-based approaches lies in their ability to characterize the global effects of infection and to serve as a discovery-based tool to identify new host response components and pathways for further study, which may ultimately lead to novel targets of therapeutic intervention.",
