IBV has already caused major health concerns in the poultry industry around the world (Cavanagh, 2003) . Like many other coronaviruses, IBV is an enveloped virus with a large, positive stranded RNA genome about 27-32 kilobases long (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . The IBV virion is built from four structural proteins, including the nucleocapsid (N) protein with which the genomic RNA is packed, the spike (S) protein that forms the prominent coronavirus spikes, the M protein which is the most abundant component of coronavirus, and the envelope (E) protein which is a minor but yet critical component in virion assembly (de Haan et al., 1998) . In addition, N protein, combined with the viral RNA with high affinity (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006) , is abundantly expressed in infected cells.",

Previously, it has been shown that forsythoside A has an antiviral effect on the syncytial virus when used at a concentration of 0.624 mm (Hu et al., 2001) . In this study, forsythoside A showed a direct anti-IBV effect at a concentration of 0.64 mm, as shown by real-time PCR assay and observation of the cytopathic effects. Although forsythoside A did not inhibit IBV infection after virus absorption, and pretreatment of the cells with forsythoside A resulted in only partial inhibition of IBV infectivity, the sensitivity of cellular factors such as the surface receptors of IBV to the drug remains under investigation. Two approaches were used to analyse virus infection, and both real-time PCR and CPE gave rise to similar results, which confirms the feasibility of these results.",

These data suggest the potential use of forsythoside A as an antiviral agent against IBV, although the mechanisms remain unclear. It has effects on cell signalling that could lead to changes in virus replication, so further studies could focus on changes induced by forsythoside A on the signal pathways relevant to IBV infection.
