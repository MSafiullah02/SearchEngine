In addition, a relatively low level of non-specific binding was recognized as compared with the negative control, and VLP binding was inhibited significantly in the presence of anti-VP1 antibody with application of 5000 HAU VLPs (Fig. 1C).

Although the viral genome was detected in various organs, such as the kidney, lymphoid tissue, lung, liver, and intestinal tract, the major target cells of JCV infection in the CNS are glial cells, such as oligodendrocytes and astrocytes [14], [15]. Therefore, we investigated the subcellular localization of the molecule recognized by 24D2 in the human brain. Positive signals for 24D2 were distributed in the glial cells of the cerebrum and cerebellum (Fig. 6\nA). To confirm the cellular distribution of the immunopositive signals, we performed double immunofluorescence staining using 24D2 and cell-specific markers, such as CA2, as a marker of oligodendrocytes [16], [17], [18], [19], GFAP, a marker of astrocytes, and synaptophysin, a neuronal marker (g\u2013i) (Fig. 6B). The immunopositive signals of 24D2 were colocalized with GFAP and CA2 (Figs. 6Ba\u2013f). However, 24D2 failed to react with synaptophysin-positive neurons (Fig. 6Bg\u2013i). These results indicated that the molecule recognized by 24D2 is distributed mainly in glial cells in the human brain.",

            "text": "Virus attachment to cell-surface molecules is an initial event in the process of virus infection. Many viruses utilize various receptors for attachment and entry into cells. The polyomavirus, simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV 40), binds to the MHC class I molecule at the cell surface [20], but the MHC molecule is not internalized into the cells together with SV 40 [21]. The ganglioside GM1 also binds to SV 40, and is mediated to transport the virus from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and a role of GM1 as a functional receptor has been suggested [22]. The mouse polyomavirus (PyV) is also known to bind to the sialic acid of an as yet unidentified receptor [23]. Efforts to identify the receptor by screening for monoclonal antibodies that can protect cells from infection have been unsuccessful [24]. It has been reported that an antibody to \u03b14\u03b21 integrin partially inhibits PyV infection [8]. Therefore, the integrin has been suggested to act as an entry receptor in the early stages of PyV infection in fibroblasts, and PyV utilizes gangliosides as carriers from the plasma membrane to the ER [22]. Interestingly, SV40 and PyV have been shown to use clathrin-independent and caveolin-dependent mechanisms to infect cells, respectively [25], [26], [27]. In contrast, JCV enters host cells by receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent endocytosis [28]. Furthermore, it has been reported that JCV does not share receptor specificity with SV 40 on human glial cells, because anti-class I antibodies failed to inhibit JCV infection [6].",

Although the major targets of JCV infection in the central nervous system are the glial cells, the viral genome was detected in various organs, such as the kidney, lymphoid tissue, lung, liver, and gastrointestinal tract [29], [30], [31], and JCV can enter a wide variety of cell types [5]. The 60-kDa molecule recognized by 24D2 was detected not only in IMR-32 cells, but also in other cell lines, including the human kidney cell line, HEK293. In addition, 24D2 showed inhibition of cellular attachment and entry of FITC-VLP to HEK293 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the molecule recognized by 24D2 also acts as a receptor in IMR-32 and HEK293 cells. As 24D2 failed to completely inhibit infection, additional molecules might participate in JCV attachment and infection.",

This smaller molecule might be an isotype or a proteolytic product of the larger molecule. It has been reported that a monoclonal antibody against the hyaluronan receptor recognized two distinct receptors in the cell membranes of rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, which were identified previously as hyaluronan-binding proteins of 175 and 300 kDa [34], [35]. After reduction of disulfide bonds, the 175-kDa hyaluronan receptor was shown to be a single protein, whereas the 300-kDa molecule consisted of three subunits, i.e., \u03b1 (269 kDa), \u03b2 (230 kDa), and \u03b3 subunits (97 kDa) [35], and it has been reported that the 175-kDa receptor was derived from the 300-kDa receptor by proteolytic processing [36]. Similar to the hyaluronan receptors, the molecules of 30 and 60 kDa recognized by 24D2 might be isoreceptors for the same ligand or products derived from a larger receptor complex. It has been reported that the receptor with 30-kDa molecular weight for human coronavirus OC43 was isolated from the newborn mouse brain membrane fractions [37]. A 30-kDa molecule detected in HeLa, COS7, and SVG cells might be similar to a coronavirus OC43 receptor.",

Positive immunoreactivity for 24D2 was colocalized with CA2-positive oligodendrocytes and GFAP-positive astrocytes, but failed to colocalize with synaptophysin-positive neurons. These findings indicated that the putative receptor molecule for JCV was localized mainly in the glial cells of the human brain. In the present study, the neuroblastoma cell line, IMR-32, was used as the immunogen for the monoclonal antibody because these cells are highly susceptible to JCV infection [38]. Furthermore, immunization of IMR-32 cell has been shown to produce an antibody that specifically recognizes a molecule in oligodendrocytes [39]. Thus, it was suggested that IMR-32 cells possess molecules in common with brain glial cells. In Fig. 6Aa and b, the immunopositive signals against 24D2 were less than those of Fig. 6Ba, d, and g. We suppose that the difference of oligodendrocyte 24D2 immunostaining patterns among Fig. 6A and B might be due to the applied immunostaining systems. In Fig. 6A, we applied the biotinylated antibody as a second antibody, and the sections were observed with light microscopy. Meanwhile, in Fig. 6B, we observed the sections labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated second antibodies with fluorescent microscopy.",

By a newly established immunoscreening system, we isolated a monoclonal antibody (24D2) that inhibits cellular attachment and infection of JCV. We also showed that the antibody specifically recognizes a membrane molecule with a molecular weight of 60 kDa, and positive signals were observed in the glial cells of the human brain. These results suggest that the molecule recognized by 24D2 acts as a JCV receptor in JCV infection. Further studies are required to characterize and determine the functional role of the molecule. A greater understanding of the molecular characteristics of the receptor molecule is necessary for the design of novel anti-JCV agents. Experiments to identify the molecules detected by 24D2 using a \u03bb phage library are currently in progress in our laboratory.",
