Most of them had chronic medical illness, whose were with high mortality 3 , and several outbreaks in long-term care facilities and leading many mortality disasters have been reported.

Every morning, they were frequently checked body temperature, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms 4 when they were sent to our facility, before and after entering the facility every morning, they were monitored every 4 hours. Secondly, the compliance of hand hygiene and surgical masks wearing were monitored tightly by staffs. The residents would be asked to stay at home if they had fever or any respiratory or gastrointestinal illness. We also stopped all unnecessary visiting. All residents were separated to more than 1 meter and less than 10 members stay in a room when eating meal and taking activities in facility. Strict environmental clearance was also taken twice per day by staff, and regularly monitored by our infection control personnel with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence assay to check the quality and the weak points of clearances to improve it frequently.",
