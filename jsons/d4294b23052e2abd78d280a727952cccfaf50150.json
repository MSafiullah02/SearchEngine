Some BSs are directed against specific cytokines or cell surface signal receptors. In recent years, the BS industry has experienced rapid growth and yielded products for treatment of a broad spectrum of diseases and disorders. Biologics are strongly relied upon to prevent rejection after organ transplantation and to treat diseases related to allergology, pneumology, rheumatology, oncology, and dermatology. BSs have revolutionized the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and organ-specific cancers (lung, stomach, colon, cervix, breast, etc.). Other conditions commonly treated or managed with biologics include several types of asthma, plaque psoriasis, chronic urticaria, and vasculitis. Some new indications and less studied applications include interstitial lung disease, unstable angina pectoris during cardiac catheterization, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, neonatal bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and multiple sclerosis ( Table 1) .",

The severity of an immune response to a biological drug may range from no clinical significance to a severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reaction [2] . Thus it became evident that the nomenclature used to describe and document immunological adverse events was not always precise enough, or the cases had not been investigated in enough detail to clearly differentiate between truly allergic and other reactions. This review will evaluate reports of allergic and substance-specific infusion reactions (IR), injection-site reactions (ISR), hypersensitivity reactions (HSR), urticaria, and anaphylaxis caused by BSs.",

However, urticaria was seen in six patients (<1%) during the 24-week period. In one patient, therapy needed to be terminated due to allergic reactions.

The most common side effects were rash (53%), urticaria (16%), pruritus (14%), and flushing (10%). Anti-alemtuzumab antibodies were detected in 62%, 67%, 29%, and 75% of the patients at 1, 3, 12, and 24 months of treatment, respectively.",

A large majority of patients may have sepsis/septic shock fragments, as well as symptoms that may also be confused with tumor lysis syndrome. IL-6 plays an important role in the development of CRS; therefore siltuximab or tocilizumab, which is a chimeric mAb against IL-6 and receptors, is used for the treatment of this condition [167] . In cases where CRS developed during treatment, the relationship between the drug itself and ADA is so far unknown.",

Various side effects and reactions can be observed during treatment, but there are deficiencies in their identification and classification. During this comprehensive research, it became evident that a more precise nomenclature should be applied. In order to achieve a harmonization in this regard, a simpler symptom-or systembased classification and scoring system is needed. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of hypersensitivity reactions and increased clinical experience in the treatment of side effects will provide timely control of unexpected reactions. As a result, immunotherapy with BSs will become safer in the future.",
