Its long incubation period, high transmission rate, and 24 estimated 3% mortality has quickly made it a global pandemic. 1, 2 As physical distancing 25 measures take hold and medical resources are directed towards COVID-19, the traditional 26 patient-physician visit has been revisited with the rapid acceleration of telemedicine. 27 28 Telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic 29 An emerging technology for over 25 years, telemedicine uses electronic and digital platforms to 30 exchange medical information for improved consumer health. Widespread use had been 31 restricted, in part, by limitations in reimbursement, 2-5 which curtailed the adoption for clinic 32 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide an emergency waiver for 34 telemedicine as billable consultations. Codes 99201-99215 for outpatient telemedicine visits 35 were approved into Medicare within days of the federal state of emergency announcement. 6 In 36 addition to established patients, the waiver allows for new patient consultations to be billed with 37 these codes. Historically resistant, but currently mobilized by the COVID-19 pandemic, some of 38 the largest health insurance providers (Aetna, Cigna, and Humana) have announced telehealth 39 reimbursement to parallel the evolving CMS reimbursement structure. 7 The reimbursement 40 structure of private insurances still vary on a state level and local guidelines should be reviewed 41 by practitioners. Prior to this, neurosurgical use of telemedicine has been limited, albeit 42 extremely successfully, to telestroke programs. 8 Its use in neurosurgical oncology has been 43 limited to institutional collaborations, rehabilitation and psychological support. 9-12 This 44 knowledge gap poses a challenge to optimal delivery of outpatient care, particularly in the 45 current pandemic. Given our institutions' early adoption of telemedicine, we summarize the 46 necessary capabilities and recommendations for the incorporation of telemedicine in outpatient 47 surgical neuro-oncology sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the expectation that this 48 technology continues to be optimized and utilized beyond this period. 49 50",

For pre-operative patients, a thorough examination should be documented prior 171 to surgery on the day of surgery. For spinal oncology patients, a more thorough exam may 172 necessitate an in-person evaluation or assistance from a caregiver/family member. When limited 173 to portions of the NIHSS or observable tasks, telemedicine can provide the basic elements of a 174 neurological examination.
