This study is a collection of clinical data from 54 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Zhongfa Xincheng district . The average age of the patients was 61.8 \u00b1 14.5 years, and the predominant age group was 50-79. The proportion of critical-type patients with comorbidities was higher than that of severe-type patients. Lymphocyte counts were significantly reduced in routine bloodwork for all patients, but significantly lower in critical-type patients than that in severe-type patients. Prolongation of prothrombin times (PT) and elevation of fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) and D-dimers (D-Ds) were detected in coagulation function tests, and more significant changes were observed in critical-type patients compared to severe-type patients. Serum ferritin levels were sensitive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection but could not be used for disease assessment. In addition, levels of two inflammatory factors, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly increased in all patients, but higher in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients. Moreover, kidney injury was the second-most common organ affected by COVID-19 followed by heart and liver. Kidney and heart injury were more severe in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients. All of the 31 severe-type patients recovered. Of the criticaltype patients, six died and 17 recovered. The length of hospital stay for critical-type patients was significantly longer for severe-type patients. In summary, increased lymphocyte counts, prolonged PT, secondary increases in fibrinolytic activity and increases in sIL-2R and IL-6 are typical features of COVID-19 and are associated with disease severity.",

All patients were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-cov-2) nucleic acid as measured by real-time fluorescence reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory tract samples. The patients exhibited fever and respiratory symptoms and pneumonia was diagnosed by imaging. The diagnosis was determined as severe-type if one of the following conditions were present: respiratory distress; respiratory frequency \u226533 times/min; oxygen saturation less than 93% in a resting state; or partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO 2 )/oxygen absorption concentration (FiO 2 ) \u2264300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kpa). Any of the following conditions resulted in a diagnosis of critical-type: respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; shock; or transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to other organ failure. The respiratory support treatment for severetype patients was medium-flow nasal cannula (5 L/min), critical-type patients received noninvasive ventilation (NIV), and/or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Recovery was also defined by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and include the disappearance of clinical symptoms, two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests for SARS-CoV-2 (sampling time interval at least 24 h), and absence of viral pneumonia as determined by a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest.",

Among the 54 severe/ critical-type patients, the average age was 61.8 \u00b1 14.5 years, with the predominant population in the age group of 50-79 years. The relationship between the age and severity of disease may be due to weaker immune systems and more comorbidities in older patients. Therefore, people with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and the elderly, appear to have a higher risk for COVID-19. All 54 patients showed significant reductions in lymphocyte counts, but the critical-type patients had lower counts than the severe-type. There was no significant difference between males and females. The decreases in lymphocytes in peripheral blood may have been caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may have led to apoptosis of lymphocytes and phagocytosis by immune cells. Alternatively, lymphocytes may have been stimulated by inflammatory cytokines, penetrated the blood vessels and accumulated in tissue. A recent study [2] found that CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 were significantly reduced, but the Th17 subset in CD4+ T lymphocytes were increased, and CD8+ T cells contained higher concentrations of cytotoxic particles. These results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 might seriously impair the immune system. Further experimental data are required, such as peripheral blood flow cytometry, analysis of humoral immunity, and examination of bone marrow to determine the exact effect of the virus on the immune system. In addition, we found that high neutrophil counts were seen in 38.9% of the 54 patients and were higher in critical-type patients than that in severe-type patients. One explanation for this observation may be that more critical-type patients had bacterial co-infections. Prolongation of PT and elevation of D-Ds and FDPs were the main characteristics of the abnormal coagulation, but APTT was not significantly changed. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause tissue damage, resulting in the release of tissue factors, which promote the exogenous coagulation pathway, leading to prolonged PT. Increases in D-Ds and FDPs indicate that a patient is in a state of secondary fibrinolysis hyperactivity. According to the COVID-19 treatment regimen developed by the National Health Commission, People's Republic of China (trial version 7) 1 , SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to partial vascular endothelial shedding and thrombosis. We believe that thrombosis might cause secondary increased fibrinolysis activity and increased D-Ds and FDPs.",

This study shows that ferritin levels were significantly elevated in severe/critical-type COVID-19 patients and was the last laboratory value to return to normal. In contrast, Hs-CRP, an acute temporal protein with a half-life of~19 h, returned to normal levels at least 5 days before ferritin did. A previous study [3] has shown that the most common cause of serum ferritin elevation is non-human immunodeficiency virus infection. We believe that the SARS-CoV-2 infection caused the increases in serum ferritin, which did not change as patients improved, and therefore cannot be used for disease assessment. However, another study [4] has determined that assembly of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus nanoparticles is related to a chaperone-mediated ferritin. The specific relationship between ferritin and coronavirus infection in humans therefore requires further study.",

In this study, sIL-2R, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly elevated in the sera of severe-and critical-type COVID-19 patients. In addition to IL-6, sIL-2R was also significantly increased and positively correlated with disease severity. Therefore, sIL-2R may be a prognostic indicator or a target for treating inflammation. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 were also elevated, but there was no significant difference between levels of these cytokines between the severe-type and critical-type patients. It has been reported that IL-1 plays an important role in the cytokine storms seen in severe influenza, but we found that the proportions of IL-1 and IL-8 elevation in both types of COVID-19 were very low.",

In addition to lung tissue, ACE2 is also highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells, heart, kidney and liver. Studies have reported that SARS-CoV can cause myocardial injury and lead to myocardial inflammation [8] . Pathologic findings in patients with COVID-19 showed inflammatory cell infiltration in the myocardium [2] . There have also been reports of detection of SARS-CoV in distal convoluted renal tubules and livers of patients with SARS [9] . Most studies of organ damage by coronavirus focus SARS-CoV, little is known about the effects of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we summarized the frequency of organ injury outside the lung and found that the kidney injury (as assessed by eGFR) was most common, followed by the heart injury (as assessed by hsTnI) and the liver injury (as assessed by ALT). Kidney and heart injury were more severe in critical-type patients than in severe-type patients, suggesting that critical-type patients are more likely to have multiple organ injuries. Compared with critical-type patients, severe-type patients have a better prognosis and a high rate of recovery because they exhibit high pulse oxygen saturation, do not need noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and/or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), experience less intense inflammatory cytokine storms, and show less organ damage.",
