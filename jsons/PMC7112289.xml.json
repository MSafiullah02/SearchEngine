With moderate doses of the viruses used for the allergen sensitization study, animals survived without pneumonia and showed infiltration of mononuclear cells into the airway wall and perivascular area 3 days after inoculation.

Allergen sensitization has been considered to be controlled by CD4+ T cells. In animal models of inhalation sensitization with ovalbumin, T-cell subsets in the spleen are reported to change; CD8+ T cells increase and the CD4/CD8 ratio decreases after sensitization.25 Induction of a TH2 immune response to ovalbumin switches the virus-infected CD8+ T-cell response to IL-5 production.26 Thus in allergen sensitization after virus infection, CD8+ T cells increase in the lung.

Inhalation of 0.05% ovalbumin with influenza infection produced a high level of ovalbumin-specific IgE but no difference in IgE production between H1 N1 and H3 N2 strains. Sakamoto et al12 showed that 0.05% ovalbumin inhalation after influenza A virus infection generated ovalbumin-specific IgE measured by PCA. Therefore influenza A infection can amplify IgE production in exposure to aerosols of a low-concentration allergen, which alone cannot produce IgE. In a prospective study,10 allergic symptoms and immunologic evidence (such as IgE RAST for specific allergens) developed in children with 2 parents with allergies. Upper respiratory infection occurred in 10 of the 11 children 1 to 2 months before the onset of allergic sensitization. Why does virus infection enhance production of specific IgE by allergen inhalation? Respiratory syncytial virus\u2013infected mice developed high ovalbumin-specific IgE in response to intranasal sensitization of ovalbumin; however, uninfected animals did not, suggesting that respiratory virus infection may change the immune response to antigens.28 In rats from which alveolar macrophages were eliminated, IgE production increased in response to inhaled allergen.29 Resident alveolar macrophages are reported to downregulate antigen that had cell functions of pulmonary dendritic cells.30 Our BALF analysis showed that infection with influenza A viruses increased lymphocytes and decreased the number of alveolar macrophages. It is likely that virus infection enhances antigen cell function, resulting in an increase in IgE production. Further, CD8+ T cells of influenza virus\u2013infected mice can coexpress different combinations of TH1 and TH2 cytokines, IL-5, and IFN-\u03b3.21 It is also reported that virus-specific CD8+ cells in the lung switch to IL-5 production.26 IL-5 upregulates IgE synthesis.31 Further, CD3\u2013 cells in the lung of influenza virus-infected mice express mRNA for IL-4, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony\u2013stimulating factor.21 Thus influenza virus infection may cause a cell-population change in lung tissue, a functional change of T cells, and cytokine production that is not restricted to the T-cell population, resulting in an increase of IgE production.",

We confirmed that sRaw reflects the change in the lower airway resistance (Fig 3). However, our absolute values of airway resistance calculated by assuming a functional residual capacity (FRC) of 1 mL are approximately 6 cm H2 O/mL/s in the baseline and higher than the previously reported values,34, 35 in which resistance was measured during mechanical ventilation after anesthesia was induced. Their methods of resistance measurement were different from ours. Their ventilation frequency and the magnitude of tidal ventilation were determined by each setting of a ventilator, and FRC was adjusted by controlling the end-expiratory pressure. Our mice breathed air spontaneously. Thus differences in method of resistance measurement, FRC, ventilation frequency, and tidal volume may affect the absolute values of resistance. Further studies may be needed for determination of precise values of airway resistance in mice.",

            "text": "In the ovalbumin sensitization group with influenza-virus infection, airway responsiveness was increased, although neither virus infection alone nor ovalbumin sensitization alone affected it. Airway responsiveness was measured 22 days after inoculation of viruses, when the BAL-cell number was not increased and inflammatory changes had recovered histologically. In our model, such airway inflammation may not cause an increase in airway responsiveness. Mechanically, airway diameter may relate to airway response. The baseline airway resistance did not differ among experimental groups. Therefore the increase in airway responsiveness may not be due to airway obstruction. Inflammation by eosinophils in the airway is an important cause of increased airway responsiveness.36 A relationship between eosinophil number in BALF and airway responsiveness is shown in mild asthma.37 In animals, an increase in airway responsiveness is reported to be associated with eosinophil infiltration of the lung tissue.38, 39 In our BALF, however, eosinophils were not found in ovalbumin sensitization with virus infection. In some asthma models of mice,16, 27 airway responsiveness was not associated with eosinophilia in lung tissue or BALF, as reflected in our results. This suggests that an increase in airway responsiveness may develop by means of mechanisms independent of eosinophil inflammation.27\n",

Recently, it was reported that ovalbumin-sensitized animals depleted of CD8+ T cells did not develop airway hyperresponsiveness, although animals with ovalbumin sensitization alone had airway hyperresponsiveness.38 Transfer of CD8+ T cells restored the airway hyperresponsiveness. When virus-specific CD8+ cells are challenged by a different antigen, a TH2 -type immune response involving IL-5 production and eosinophilia occurs in the airway.26 As described earlier, virus-infected CD8+ T cells may enhance IgE production. Induction of allergen-specific IgE production is believed to be 1 of the elements contributing to increased airway responsiveness.41 In various animal models of asthma, airway responsiveness increases with the increase in IgE level.11, 16, 25, 27, 39 In this regard, our data compare with the previous studies. Therefore an increase in the IgE- and TH2 -type immune response of CD8+ T cells may contribute to the increase in airway responsiveness.",
