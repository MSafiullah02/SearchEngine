            "text": "Neutrophils play an essential role in innate immunity. In addition to activating phagocytosis and secreting superoxides and hydrolytic enzymes, the neutrophil must be able to chemotax, or migrate toward the source of a chemoattractant [1], [2]. The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) is a chemoattractant G protein-coupled receptor found on the surface of phagocytes and it is thought to play an important role in allowing phagocytic cells to recognize the presence of bacteria [3] and damaged cells, since only eubacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts initiate their protein synthesis with formyl-methionine [4]. FPR expressing cells also exhibit chemotaxis toward peptides derived from the GP-41 envelope protein of HIV-1 [5], [6]. A peptide derived from herpes simplex virus type 2 elicited chemotaxis and superoxide production in neutrophils in a process that appeared to involve FPR [7]. In addition, we recently observed that peptides from the proximal membrane region of the fusion proteins of human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, coronaviruses 229E and HKU, and Ebola virus were potent inhibitors of FPR [8]. Thus FPR appears to respond to the presence of virally derived peptides in addition to bacterially derived ones (for a review of ligands affecting FPR see [9]). Two proteins secreted by Staphylococcus aureus are inhibitors of FPR ([10], [11], [12]). Chemotaxis inhibitory factor of S. aureus (CHIPS) inhibits FPR and the C5a receptor and a homologue of CHIPS, FPRL1 inhibitory protein (FLIPr) inhibits FPRL1 and to a lesser extent FPR, but not C5a. The N-terminus of CHIPS is essential for binding to FPR since removal of the n-terminal phenylalanine reduces affinity for FPR \u223c 1000 fold. Peptides derived from the N-terminus are also inhibitors of FPR but with \u223c 10,000 fold lower affinity than CHIPS.",

Numerous studies have indicated that patients with aggressive periodontitis exhibit a \u223c 2 fold reduction in chemotaxis toward fMLF [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] indicating that a reduced ability to exhibit chemotaxis toward formyl peptides may be associated with this disease.

We identified several formyl peptides that exhibit high selectivity for activation of R190/K192 and R190/N192 compared with W190/N192.

The results are shown in Table 2\n. The sequence prediction of rhodopsin is also given since its crystal structure is known [37]. TMH V in rhodopsin begins at E202 and is the first residue predicted to have a non-zero value for helix propensity. Underlined residues in the rhodopsin sequence are identical in FPR. W190/N192 exhibits a reduced helix propensity of 113 vs. 140 for R190/N192 or 137 for R190/K192 (summation of helix propensity for residues N-terminal to FPR P213 or rhodopsin P215; underlined in Table 2). PRISPED analysis of all three FPR sequences suggests that TMH V is longer than that observed with rhodopsin as we previously suggested [8] based on Kyte and Doolittle [38] analysis, but the predicted beginning of helix V varies depending upon the FPR sequence. Most interesting is the predicted effect W190/N192 has on the helix propensity of the residues N-terminal to FPR P213. P213 was previously shown to be important in FPR structure, since P213A did not fold properly and was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum [39]. Since proline is secondary amine, it cannot hydrogen bond and this destabilizes the helix N-terminal to the proline. In rhodopsin, the carbonyl of H211 hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate of E122 (which can only occur if H211 is not hydrogen bonded to P215, a residue highly conserved in GPCR [40]). The H211 carbonyl is important in rhodopsin activation, since its hydrogen bonding with E122 is disrupted upon rhodopsin activation [41]. We have previously shown that F110, which is analogous to E122 of rhodopsin, is important in FPR activation, since the F110A mutant exhibits very poor coupling to G protein, and very poor chemotaxis toward fMLF [42]. While FPR F110 cannot hydrogen bond to the carbonyl of FPR G209 (analogous to rhodopsin H211), aromatic rings do exhibit energetically favorably interactions with carbonyl oxygens [43]. F110 interaction with the G209 carbonyl and disruption of the F110\u2013G209 interaction by ligand binding could be important in FPR activation. The fact that W190/N190 is predicted to exhibit lower helicity near G209 may alter its ability to be activated in response to ligand binding (Table 2).",

Here we observed that the three W in the peptide WEDWVGWI are all essential for FPR binding, just as they are essential for antiviral activity [31]. This could be due to changes in structure of the peptide since WEDWVGAI was shown by NMR in DMSO\u2013water solution to adopt a different structure than WEDWVGWI [31]. Nonetheless, the correlation between antiviral activity and ability to interact with FPR is an intriguing one, especially since FPR is able to interact with the proximal membrane region of many viruses [8].",

We have also shown that W190 quenches the fluorescence of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-AlexaFluor, indicating W190 must reside close to the AlexaFluor moiety when this peptide is bound to FPR [8]. These findings are both consistent with the larger effects observed with W190/N192 with longer peptides since only peptides much longer than three residues are likely to interact near R or W190. In addition, provided that formyl-MFTFEPFPTN is a good model for CHIPS binding, this might indicate that the polymorphism W190/N192 would be more resistant to inhibition by CHIPS and thus those with this polymorphism might control infections with S. aureus better than those with the R190 polymorphism. Recent studies have indicated that a high percentage of normal individuals (24/24) express antibodies to CHIPS [47], so that a polymorphism that was more resistant to its effect might exhibit a selective advantage, since W190/N192 retains most of its ability to interact with formylated tri peptides.",
