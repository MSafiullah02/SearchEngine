Although MV is usually seen as a life-saving strategy, it has a strong potential to worsen the prognosis with prolonged use. According to the 2005 consensus of the National Association for Medical Direction of Respiratory Care (NAMDRC), prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) is defined as the requirement of MV for more than 6 h daily and that lasts for more than 21 consecutive days [1]. The requirement of PMV is associated with increased medical care demand and expenses [2, 3], high early and long-term mortality [4, 5], and worse life quality [6\u20139]. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the prognosis in PMV patients in ICUs to facilitate the decision making process of the physicians and patients\u2019 family members on treatment schedule in the ICUs.",

They used four factors including age, platelet count, use of vasopressors, and requirement of renal replacement therapy to calculate the ProVent score. Another study showed only low platelet count on the 21st day of MV as a predictor of 1-year mortality in patients requiring PMV in a medical ICU in Korea [11]. However, in a mixed ICU study in France, use of vasopressors, and requirement of renal replacement therapy are predictors of 1-year mortality in patients requiring PMV [12]. Therefore, due to the inconsistent findings, further studies are needed to evaluate this further. In addition, no study has yet to demonstrate the predictors of 1-year mortality in patients requiring PMV in ICU after surgery. The purpose of this study was to analyze the predictors of 1-year mortality in patients requiring PMV in ICU after surgery.",

The same study showed that age was a predictor of 1-year mortality in PMV patients, but this was not demonstrated in our study; this might have been caused by the different study populations. In critically ill patients, thrombocytopenia is usually caused by severe infections, side effect of medications, and myelosuppression among others; which is regarded as a sign of illness aggravation [15]. Requirement of vasopressors implies an unstable circulation, which is associated with higher occurrence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [16]. In patients with sepsis and MODS, requirement of vasopressors is also associated with increased 1-year and 5-year mortality [17]. Requirement of renal replacement therapy on the 21st day of MV is usually caused by renal failure, and is also regarded as a sign of poor prognosis [12].",
