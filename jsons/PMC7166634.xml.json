Like other emerging infectious diseases, MERS outbreaks may occur anywhere in the world (CDC 2015). A patient infected with MERS\u2010CoV was first identified in Korea on 11 May 2015. He was a 68\u2010year\u2010old businessman who had resided in the Middle East region for 13 days before returning to Korea (Hui et al. 2015, Korea Centers for Disease Control [KCDC] 2015). The first patient presented symptoms such as high fever and coughing and was diagnosed late on the 19th of June (KCDC 2015). As a result of his late diagnosis, MERS began to spread through the hospital. The importation of this emerging infectious disease created a national medical crisis in Korea. As of November 25, 2015, there were 186 patients with diagnosed with MERS, and over 16,000 people had been in contact with MERS patients. Of those infected either by patient zero or secondarily, 38 (20\u00b74%) have died (KCDC 2015). Of particular import, 39 (21%) of those infected were healthcare workers (HCWs), including eight doctors and 15 nurses, who were caring for or treating MERS patients (KCDC 2015).",

Lack of knowledge within the general population about an infectious disease can create fear, misunderstanding and prejudice, which may lead to the avoidance of infected people or HCWs (Gautret et al. 2013, Khan et al. 2014). The transmission of MERS\u2010CoV to HCWs has also been reported in other countries (Assiri et al. 2013, Memish et al. 2013). As hospitals continue to admit patients who may have contracted MERS, the rapid identification of the disease and effective implementation of infection control precautions could help protect HCWs (Bialek et al. 2014, Hall et al. 2014).",

A basic survey of nursing students\u2019 MERS\u2010related knowledge, preventive behaviours and risk perception is necessary because MERS is currently spreading in hospitals throughout Korea. Although hospital practice has been discontinued at this time, nursing students are future professionals who will be expected to cope with emerging infectious diseases (Choi & Yang 2010). By surveying the MERS\u2010related knowledge, preventive behaviours and risk perception in those nursing students at high risk of exposure to MERS, we hope to provide basic information for designing health education programmes to efficiently and feasibly prevent MERS\u2010CoV infection in nursing students and contribute to their compliance of infection prevention guidelines and health promotion.",

However, they had low performance rates of preventive behaviours (44\u00b75%). More than half of the subjects in this study received some form of MERS education, most of which was obtained through TV, which is similar to the findings from a previous study in which knowledge about emerging infectious diseases was obtained by watching TV reports independently of the subjects\u2019 nursing studies (Brug et al. 2004). The reason for this finding may be because universities and hospitals in Korea did not have time to prepare education programmes for nursing students due to the abrupt importation of MERS; however, MERS\u2010related news has been telecast almost every day since the identification of the first MERS patient. Accordingly, it is necessary for hospitals and universities to prepare follow\u2010up education programmes regarding MERS characteristics for nursing students. The study items with the two highest correct\u2010answer rates (i.e. \u2018When coughing frequently, the use of a mask prevents droplet transmission\u2019 and \u2018Nursing staff for MERS patients should wear special protective equipment\u2019, respectively) were similar to an item in a previous report about MERS\u2010related knowledge among Saudi Arabian HCWs (Khan et al. 2014). In that previous report, the item with the highest correct\u2010answer rate was \u2018Special caution is used in medical acts for patients with MERS symptoms\u2019 (Khan et al. 2014). This study items with the lowest correct\u2010answer rates were about the diagnosis and treatment of MERS. Similar to our study's findings, the level of knowledge about the treatment of MERS was very poor among HCWs in a previous study (Al\u2010Tawfiq & Memish 2014, Khan et al. 2014). MERS is diagnosed with the polymerase chain reaction using sputum, laryngopharyngeal discharge and bronchial washing fluid (CDC 2015; KCDC 2015). The preliminary diagnosis of MERS is the starting point for isolation and nursing of patients, which can influence the patients\u2019 definite diagnosis and release from isolation. It is essential to understand accurate collection methods and wear protective equipment for preventing infection during specimen sampling (CDC 2015; KCDC 2015). Considering the low correct\u2010answer rate for the items related to MERS diagnosis, educating nursing students about the collection and management of specimens from hospital patients is necessary.",

The item with the highest performance rate was \u2018I washed my hands more often than usual.\u2019 This is a positive result in this study that confirms prior study's findings that HCWs showed a high performance rate of handwashing during an outbreak of Severe Acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Quah & Hin\u2010Peng 2004, Imai et al. 2005) and that handwashing lowered the morbidity and mortality of SARS (Brug et al. 2004). Handwashing is a basic life habit for preventing all infectious diseases; therefore, it is necessary for the government and universities to intensify education regarding continuous and effective handwashing behaviours for nursing students who will eventually work in the healthcare field (Quah & Hin\u2010Peng 2004, Imai et al. 2005, Khan et al. 2014).",

The risk perception for students who had received MERS education was high compared to their counterparts (2\u00b75 vs. 2\u00b72). MERS education can be effective in increasing risk perception, and systematic education programmes need to be developed based on the content desired by the students. In this study, risk perception of MERS was particularly high among women, which was consistent with a previous report in which the risk perception was significantly higher in women who were Saudi Arabian HCWs (Khan et al. 2014). However, the attitudes of nursing students towards emerging infectious diseases varied according to gender (Tam et al. 2007). The number of male subjects in this study was small; therefore, studies with increased sample sizes that reflect cultural and national characteristics should be conducted in the future.",

The current curriculum only includes two to four hours of standard precautions theory and practice during a student's second year of the nursing programme (Choi & Yang 2010). This lack of education may also be a problem in other countries (Choi & Yang 2010, Mitchell et al. 2014). Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases such as MERS can occur anytime; because of this, infection prevention guidelines should be included in the curriculum of nursing students who have clinical rotations in hospital settings. Practical education programs such as correct handwashing, masking and environmental decontamination methods for improving clinical practice should be included along with theory education that includes MERS transmission, treatment and diagnosis. These educational system changes should be preceded by nursing educators\u2019 efforts and reforms (Choi & Yang 2010). For increasing risk perception rates, study cases of MERS infection should be reviewed before hospital practice so that nursing students may be aware that healthcare workers can be infected by a minor mistake in hospital. If such specific and practical programmes were implemented, nursing students\u2019 preventive behaviours for MERS will be improved.",

In this study, the level of MERS\u2010related knowledge was 84\u00b74% among nursing students who had discontinued hospital practice due to that outbreak. The level of preventive behaviours was 44\u00b75%, and risk perception was 2\u00b74 out of 5. Receiving MERS education was a significant factor for increasing one's risk perception of the disease. Considering the low scores for items regarding knowledge and preventive behaviours, it is necessary to develop effective and systematic publicity and education programmes for nursing students. MERS\u2010related knowledge, preventive behaviours and risk perception were positively correlated with one another. Therefore, enhancing MERS\u2010related knowledge by considering cooperation between hospitals and universities will sharpen nursing students\u2019 risk perception of the disease and effectively increase their preventive behaviours. The results about such a new infectious disease are meaningful as basic information for improving nursing students\u2019 nursing education and nursing practice and may be reflected in clinical practice.",
