These increased encounters have led to an increased need for veterinary participation in managing sick and injured animals. For much of the public, veterinarians are still held in reverence because of the James Herriott stories. We believe that it is important for veterinarians to maintain this image. This does not necessarily suggest that veterinarians should consider themselves experts on all animal species, but that as professionals, they should develop an infrastructure of resources that enables them to provide medical and surgical care for those animals in need. In addition, because many of these animals can serve as reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, veterinarians can play an important role in minimizing the risk of disease transmission between wildlife and concerned citizens. For some veterinarians, their role may require them to maintain a current list of veterinarians or wildlife rehabilitators capable of managing an injured wildlife patient and refer clients to these professionals. For others with a more invested interest, it may mean that they will pursue available resources to develop the knowledge and skill for managing these animals in their hospital. The last thing clients, or prospective clients, want to hear from veterinarians is \u201cWe don't work with those animals.\u201d Instead, if veterinarians can, at a minimum, direct clients to the most appropriate resource, veterinarians maintain (and justify) their image among the professions.",

            "text": "There are many financial, ethical, and emotional issues for veterinarians to consider when deciding whether to accept wildlife cases to their practice. Wildlife is not owned and therefore do not come with paying caretakers. In many cases, the hospital will be expected to absorb the cost of treatment, although avenues for monetary compensation, including grants and public donations, do exist. Accepting wildlife cases is often perceived by (prospective) clients as a positive reinforcement of a veterinarian's compassion toward animals and can serve, directly or indirectly, as a method of increasing a veterinarian's domestic and exotic pet caseload. One ethical consideration to make with these cases is deciding when intervention may interfere with a natural process occurring in a population. In some cases, euthanasia will certainly end suffering, whereas in others treatment may interfere with both natural selection and the disease status in a population. However, because the lives of humans have become so enmeshed with populations of wild animals, it is unavoidable that some, if not most, of the injuries or disease processes occurring in wildlife populations are the direct result of human contact. In these cases, there may be a strong moral (ethical) obligation to repair damage caused by the human species. An early and rational assessment of the likely return to function for a patient is imperative to conserve the available resources for treatment and prevent undue suffering in the patient. Animals who are considered poor candidates for release or placement should be considered for euthanasia as soon as an assessment is made. Release candidates should be able to function appropriately within their natural habitat (including reproduction) and with conspecifics; otherwise, a disservice is rendered to both the animal and its population.",

The task is not made easier by the scarcity of information on outcomes of wildlife rehabilitation cases, although more studies are being done.

These regulations have been enacted at the federal and state levels to ensure the protection of these animals against individuals that would otherwise exploit them (e.g., meat or fur). Historically, veterinarians were perceived as \u201cgood Samaritans,\u201d and it was just accepted that veterinarians would or could provide any medical and surgical care that a particular wildlife patient required. Unfortunately, some veterinarians, like many unlicensed wildlife rehabilitators, will attempt to complete the rehabilitation process for their wildlife patients, even though they cannot meet their patient's husbandry, nutritional, or posttreatment rehabilitation needs. Currently, federal and state governments are committed to maintaining veterinarians as an integral component to the care of injured wildlife and consider veterinarians to be the experts for providing medical and surgical care for these animals. However, these agencies also realize that most veterinarians do not have the time or facilities to fully rehabilitate injured wildlife. Because of this, federal and state agencies require veterinarians (without state and/or federal rehabilitation permits) to transfer these animals to licensed rehabilitators to complete the rehabilitation process. It is expected that a veterinarian will transfer any wildlife patient to a licensed wildlife rehabilitator within 24 hours of stabilizing the patient. A stabilized patient is one that is no longer in dire need of veterinary medical care. Patients that require medical treatment that can be administered via an experienced (trained) rehabilitator should be transferred.",

Such a diverse caseload requires veterinarians to be adaptive to the different needs of these animals, both in their medical and surgical knowledge and in their ability to meet the rehabilitation needs (e.g., diet, environment) of the patient. Many veterinarians will limit the types of cases presented to their hospitals. Some of the veterinarians we consult with only accept chelonians, whereas others may accept only avian cases. It is important that veterinarians inform wildlife rehabilitators and clients of particular species they exclude from their practices. It would also be helpful to have a list of other veterinarians on hand that do accept those species, so that those individuals can be referred to an appropriate facility.",

Wildlife cases can require a significant amount of time and effort, especially orphaned animals. Therefore, it is often the veterinary staff that will have the most contact with the wildlife cases. Veterinarians that accept these types of cases on a moderate to large scale would certainly benefit from providing at least some of their staff an opportunity to obtain continuing education in wildlife rehabilitation. Many of these opportunities can be obtained from local or state meetings, although the large national meetings (e.g., the annual conferences of the National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association and the International Wildlife Rehabilitators Association) provide the most diverse training opportunities. Membership in these organizations is also highly recommended, as they publish regular bulletins or journals and provide a real resource of potential personal contacts.",

In our opinion, this is the single most controversial issue that can arise in a hospital. If staff members (and veterinarians) become emotionally attached to their cases, they are less likely to maintain an objective outlook on their cases. It is important to always approach these cases with a triage mentality (Figure 19-1\n). The time spent treating these patients should also be limited to necessary contact only. Animals that become habituated to humans in captivity may be at greater risk of reinjury or death after release if they lose their fear of humans. For orphaned animals, imprinting is a major concern. Imprinting occurs when an animal recognizes a human as the \u201cparent\u201d animal. Imprinting can potentially lead to dangerous encounters for humans and wildlife, especially with mesopredators, carnivores, and raptors. For this reason, it is important that only trained staff manage orphaned animals.",

Raptors are prone to damaging their feathers, wings, talons, and cere in captivity. Injuries to any of these body parts can delay the rehabilitation process and should be avoided at all costs. The best cage materials to use for housing raptors are those that do not bend or damage the feathers. Because most veterinary hospitals maintain chain-link fence kennels or stainless steel cages, housing for raptors may be limited. Covering the cage with a soft mesh can help diminish the amount of feather damage done to hospitalized raptors. Tailguards made out of old radiograph film can be used to reduce tail feather damage. Perches can also be used to help limit the amount of damage done to the tail feathers. The perch should be positioned so that the tail feathers do not touch the base of the cage and the flight feathers have minimal contact with the sides of the cage. For extended hospitalization, raptors should be housed in an appropriately sized aviary. Whereas groups of some species can be housed together, mixing raptors is not recommended. As with short-term housing, care must be taken that the animal cannot injure itself. An easily disinfected substrate, such as Astroturf or gravel, can be used for the aviary. Multiple perches should be provided. If the bird is not a solid flier, the perches should be maintained close to the ground. Covering the perches with a rough surface (e.g., Astroturf) will minimize the likelihood of a bird developing pododermatitis. Multiple diameter and textured perches should be placed in the cage; however, the diameter should not be so small that the talons puncture the plantar surface of the foot.3 The perches should be cleaned regularly to minimize the likelihood of fecal contamination. As with other species, hay or straw should not be used because of the potential for exposure to Aspergillus spp. spores. Certain species, such as owls, will benefit from shelter.",

Some examples of reptile groupings by environment include those that are aquatic, semiaquatic, arboreal, or terrestrial. Of the terrestrial reptiles, subgroups include those that are fossorial (burrowing), thigmotactic (prefer to wedge themselves into rocky crevices when not basking), and those that live on the surface of the soil. Reptiles can also be grouped according to the time of day that they are active: diurnal, nocturnal, and crepuscular (active during dusk or dawn). Species habits must be known before appropriate housing can be provided. Reptiles kept in inappropriate environments can develop a variety of conditions that will delay the rehabilitation process. For example, terrestrial species kept in moist cages may develop integumentary disease, whereas aquatic species housed in dry habitats will become dehydrated. Arboreal reptiles must be provided with branches, reptiles adapted to saline or brackish water should be furnished with water of the appropriate salinity, fossorial species must be provided substrate to burrow in, and secretive reptiles must be provided hiding places. Water should be provided in the form in which the animal is used to imbibing it. Many lizards drink from rain or dewdrops on foliage and will not drink from dishes. Tortoises should be provided with a shallow bowl of water. For additional information regarding the specific husbandry needs of reptiles, see the appropriate chapters in this text.",

Wildlife should be housed in a separate room from domestic species. A room with its own ventilation system is preferred. The traffic through the wildlife ward should be one-way. A foot bath with a disinfectant (e.g., sodium hypochlorite) should be placed outside the doorway and used after exiting the room to minimize the likelihood of tracking infectious diseases throughout the hospital. The disinfectant should be changed daily, or as often as needed, to minimize the amount of organic debris in the solution. Organic debris renders many disinfectants useless. Laboratory coats, or preferably jumpsuits that totally cover clothing, should be placed in the wildlife ward and worn when working with the animals. These clothing materials should be taken out of the room only for washing. Any materials being removed from the ward should be placed in a garbage bag and carried through the hospital in these bags to minimize the likelihood of disseminating disease through the hospital.

Although birds are endotherms, there are times when the provision of supplemental heat is important. Birds that fluff their feathers do so to maintain body heat. Birds displaying this behavior must convert energy to maintain their core body temperature. To confirm this, the animal's body temperature should be taken. Birds naturally maintain a higher body temperature than mammals, with most birds falling between 104\u00b0 F and 108\u00b0 F. Because birds with an illness must conserve energy, it is important that veterinarians provide supplemental heat to minimize the energy expenditure associated withheat conservation. Temperature-controlled incubators provide an excellent method of providing a consistent environmental temperature (Figure 19-3\n). Heating pads, hot water bottles, and incandescent lights can also be used to provide supplemental heat, but all should be monitored closely. Adult birds that are hypothermic can be maintained in an environmental temperature of 82\u00b0 F to 88\u00b0 F, whereas juvenile birds may need to be kept warmer depending on the extent of their feather coverage (e.g., nestling vs. fledgling). Mammals, like birds, are also endothermic, and although they can control their own body temperature, they may require supplemental heat on occasion. Mammals that are hypothermic may shiver, have cold extremities, and have a body temperature below the acceptable reference range. Most mammalian body temperatures are between 100\u00b0 F and 104\u00b0 F. Opossums are an exception, generally having a body temperature between 92\u00b0 F and 96\u00b0 F. Reptiles are ectotherms and depend on their environmental temperature to regulate their core body temperature.

Fluids should always be warmed to the patient's physiologic temperature before being administered. Identifying which fluid is most appropriate will be based on the type of dehydration. Most wildlife cases present with isotonic dehydration, so a balanced fluid (e.g., 0.9% saline, lactated Ringer's solution) can be used. Calculating the patient's osmolality is the best method for estimating the type of dehydration. Laboratories using osmometers can calculate this number; however, if submitting a sample is not possible, then an estimate can be made using the following mathematical formula: OsM = 2(sodium + potassium) + urea + glucose. For reptiles and birds, uric acid can be used as a substitute for urea; however, it may underestimate the true osmolality.

Depending on the site and nature of the fracture, various emergency bandaging methods can be employed. We generally immobilize wing fractures with a figure-of-eight splint (Figure 19-5\n) or a body wrap. The figure-of-eight splint is appropriate for fractures distal to the elbow, and a body wrap is recommended when the fracture includes the humerus. Vet-wrap (3M Corp., St. Paul, MN), or another comparable bandage material, can be used. For small birds (e.g., hummingbirds), placing the wings in a normal position and taping the primaries where they cross can provide an adequate splint. When immobilizing the wings of a bird, it is important to change the bandage and provide physical therapy every 3 to 4 days. This will prevent excessive contraction of the patagial tendon and atrophy of the muscles. We prefer to replace the bandage under anesthesia, as this minimizes the likelihood of the animal reinjuring itself and controls the pain associated with the procedure. In birds, fractures of the legs can be immobilized with modified syringe-case splints, tape splints, a ball bandage, or a Robert Jones\u2013type splint. Syringe case splints are best suited for fractures distal to the stifle. Tape splints can be used to stabilize toes or the distal leg of a passerine or other lightweight bird. We generally use white, porous tape for these splints. For mammals, limbs can be splinted using the standard techniques described for domestic mammals. Fractures of the reptile limb can be immobilized by taping the limb to the animal's body. In lizards, a forelimb can be secured against the body wall using porous tape while the rear leg can be immobilized against the tail. In chelonians, the limb can be reduced into a normal position within the shell and taped into place. When splinting any limb, it is important to always immobilize the joint above and below the fracture site.",

If necrotic tissue is left behind, it will delay the healing process. Sharp dissection of the wound should be done to remove all of the necrotic tissue. Wound disinfection can be done by irrigating the wound with dilute chlorhexidine, Betadine, or 50% dextrose. We have used the hyperosmotic dextrose, with excellent results. Others report similar results with honey. After disinfection, the wound should be rinsed with a warmed sterile saline.

Bandage material can be applied to the wound if additional protection is required. A wet-to-dry bandage can be applied to any wound that requires decontamination. Depending on the size of the wound, either 2\u2033 \u00d7 2\u2033 or 4\u2033 \u00d7 4\u2033 gauze pads can be used for the bandage.

An additional 4 to 5 dry gauze pads should be placed on top of the moistened pads. All of the gauze should be secured to the wound with Vet-wrap. The bandage should be changed daily. Any necrotic tissue should be removed in between bandage changes. While uncovered, the wound should be disinfected using the technique described previously.

A towel can be wrapped around the body of these birds to restrain the wings; however, the towel should not be held so tight that it affects respiration (e.g., keel excursions). Because seabirds commonly regurgitate, it is important to remove any beak restraint before transporting the animal, to prevent aspiration.5 The transportation carrier must be large enough to prevent damage to the flight and tail feathers.",

Thick leather gloves, such as welding gloves, should be worn when handling medium to larger-sized specimens. Small raptors may be handled using outdoor work gloves (e.g., cotton or leather). When approached, most raptors roll backward and present their talons. When presented with a bird in this position, it is possible to offer them a towel or blanket to grasp before restraining the legs. The legs should always be grasped as close to the body wall as possible, as this will reduce the likelihood of causing a tibiotarsal fracture or injuries associated with self-taloning. The head of the raptor should be grasped using the same techniques to restrain other birds, with the index finger and thumb positioned under the mandible (Figure 19-6\n). For animals that are free-ranging, a bal chatri trap may be used. These traps can be built out of wire mesh (e.g., chicken wire) and fishing line. The wire mesh is first used to construct a wire cage to hold a live prey species (e.g., pigeon or rodent). A second piece of chicken wire is then placed over the prey cage, thus preventing injury to the prey species. The fishing line is then cut into small pieces (6-8 cm) and tied into small nooses. These nooses are secured over the entire surface of the trap. When the raptor attacks the trap, it becomes entangled in the trap and cannot lift off the ground with the trap.",

It is important that the handler does not exert excessive pressure when extracting the head and neck, as this can lead to cervical injury. For those species that can completely enclose themselves within their shell (e.g., box turtle: Terrapene carolina), chemical anesthesia is recommended. Placing the animal in a shallow volume of water may stimulate them to exit their shell, but waiting for this to occur can be time consuming.",

This organism is extremely contagious in these birds. Mild cases can be simple to treat, but advanced cases carry a poor prognosis. Many of the severe cases show some improvement with treatment, only to succumb before the completion of the treatment and elimination of the signs. For this reason, we generally recommend euthanasia for the severe cases. Bacterial and fungal infections of the crop (ingluvitis) are common, especially in young birds. A foul smell in the oral cavity can be an indication of a crop infection. The crop itself may appear thickened, enlarged, and have a decreased emptying time. Septic arthritis, often the result of infection with Salmonella sp. or E. coli, is common in these birds and may resolve with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; however, some authors advise against treatment because of the chronic joint problems that may arise after treatment and the zoonotic potential for the handlers.1 Pigeons and doves can serve as reservoirs for pathogens that are highly infectious to other birds, including paramyxovirus (Newcastle disease\u2014a reportable disease) and poxvirus. Pigeons or doves presenting with clinical signs consistent with these diseases should be euthanized to minimize the likelihood of disease transmission to other birds. A bird with a paramyxovirus infection may display a range of clinical signs, including head tremors, diarrhea, deformed eggs, torticollis, polyuria, polydipsia, and anorexia.

Paramyxovirus (Newcastle disease) and pheasant coronavirus, which causes multiple masses around the head and limbs, are the most common viral diseases. These birds are susceptible to a variety of opportunistic bacterial pathogens. Some of the more common pathogens are E. coli, Salmonella sp., and Mycobacterium avium. Birds with E. coli infections generally present in critical condition and often appear hypothermic (fluffed) and depressed. Salmonella sp. is usually associated with hemorrhagic enteritis, and animals often succumb to this disease acutely. Mycobacteriosis is generally associated with general body wasting, sinusitis, and tenosynovitis. This pathogen is zoonotic, so appropriate precautions should be taken when handling and disposing an animal. Fungal infections with Aspergillus spp. can result from spore inhalation, and affected animals develop clinical signs associated with the respiratory tract, including coughing and dyspnea. The parasitic diseases reported in gamebirds are similar to those seen in pigeons and doves. Capillaria sp. is a common finding in both wild and captive gamebirds. This endoparasite can cause severe loss of body condition, and it is not uncommon for animals to succumb to infection. Commonly, gamebirds are semi-intensively farmed before release and may be prone to parasitic infections. A soiled vent and diarrhea are common findings in gamebirds with endoparasitic infections.

For some facilities, euthanasia is considered the most humane option for these cases. Common reasons deer are presented to veterinary hospitals include traumatic injury (e.g., automobile, entanglement, dog attack, gunshot), myopathy, healthy fawns mistaken for orphans, and fawns suffering from starvation after hard winters. Traumatic injury commonly results in limb, pelvic, or facial fractures, or spinal injury. Deer can survive with a missing limb, and some authors believe amputation is a viable alternative to euthanasia. Myopathy may occur following attempts to evade predators (including humans) and may be evidenced by recumbent, hyperthermic, hyperventilating deer with hindlimb paralysis. Irreversible metabolic changes usually result.4 Johne's disease, epizootic hemorrhagic disease, coronavirus diarrhea, rotavirus diarrhea, colibacillosis, salmonellosis, and mycobacteriosis represent common infectious disease presentations for deer.

This should only be pursued if, for the foreseeable future, it could be determined that the animal would maintain a reasonable quality of life in captivity and there is a sound justification for this action. Justifications for retaining permanently disabled wildlife cases in captivity include captive breeding programs, education programs, and imprint models.12 Permanently disabled adult animals have long been used to produce offspring for both endangered species and falconry programs. Much of the conservation success associated with the bald eagle and peregrine falcon in the United States was based on this type of model. Many of the education programs provided by wildlife hospitals and rehabilitators use permanently injured wildlife. These types of education presentations allow children and adults to observe these animals up close and, in many cases, display the negative impact humans have on these animals.

For these birds, crop milk provides the sole source of nutrients during the first few days of life and remains the primary food for the first week to 10 days after hatching. Gradually, crop milk is mixed with the adult diet and fed to hatchlings by both adult parents. Crop milk is crucial for the survival of squabs, as they hatch in a relatively undeveloped state. Squabs are unable to use food found in their environment, cannot digest an adult bird's diet, hatch with their eyes unopened, and do not possess feathering for thermoregulation after hatching. The composition of crop milk is similar to that found in mammals; it contains water, fat, protein, and ash. The primary difference between the avian milk and mammalian milk is in the carbohydrate and protein fractions. Pigeon milk is devoid of lactose. It does, however, contain high levels of crude protein and fat. When working with these animals, attempts to mimic this formula should be made. The following formula (for a day's feeding) has been recommended: Mix one hard-boiled egg yolk (mashed), 3 tablespoons mixed baby cereal, 3 tablespoons oatmeal, and 3 tablespoons cornmeal.13 We have used both a commercial critical care psittacine formula and a psittacine neonatal formula (Lafeber Company, Cornell, IL) with good success in these animals too.",

Surrogate raptors can be an invaluable resource to those who are rehabilitating orphaned raptors. A surrogate puppet can also be used as a last resort.",

Rodents (e.g., mice, rats, gerbils, guinea pigs, rabbits), chickens (chicks), and invertebrates (e.g., crickets and mealworms) are the most commonly available commercially raised prey items for raptors. Some facilities recommend feeding wild squirrels and songbirds that die of noninfectious causes (e.g., traumatic injury), as this is economical and a natural process for many of the opportunistic feeding raptors. Unfortunately, these types of prey items may still serve as a source of parasites or other latent infectious disease for the raptors.

Newly hatched raptors should be fed every 2 to 3 hours for 2 to 3 days. It is important not to overfeed these animals, as constipation can occur. For the first 2 to 3 days of life, no bone, fur, or feathers should be offered. At 3 days to 1 week of age, mice, pinky rats, or smaller songbirds can be offered every 3 to 5 hours, with no large bones or bone splinters and no fur or feathers. After the first week, the amount of fur and feathers offered, as well as the size of morsel, should be gradually increased until the raptor chick is eating the entire contents of the prey item. Raptor chicks will generally eat more food than an adult of the same species, reaching a peak at 2 to 3 weeks when they will eat more than double an adult.3 Downy raptors should be fed every 4 to 6 hours and fed as much as they will take at one feeding. Do not offer artificial casting materials (e.g., dog fur, cotton), as they have been implicated in causing intestinal blockage and crop impaction.15 Once the chick's eyes are open and they are investigating with their beaks, fresh carcasses should be left in the environment. The body weight of these animals should be monitored closely and the diet adjusted accordingly. At 2 to 3 weeks of age, various sized perches and branches should be offered. Once the chick is fully feathered and attempting to use its wings, it can be moved to an outdoor aviary to begin learning to fly and build strength.",

An electric heating pad or warmed water bottle can provide supplemental heat. A nest substitute can be placed in the enclosure to mimic an animal's natural setting. A small open cardboard box with tissue paper, paper towels, or a cotton blanket will serve as an appropriate nest substitute. A squirrel's eyes open between 19 and 21 days of age. Males and females may need to be separated; sibling penis suckling is common as the penis can be mistaken for a teat. Omnivore (e.g., canine) or carnivore (e.g., feline) milk replacers most closely represent the natural composition of a squirrel's milk. The formula should be made daily, refrigerated between feedings, and warmed to body temperature before each feeding. A small syringe (e.g., 1-ml or 3-ml) can be used to nurse the squirrel. For feeding, the animal can either be placed in lateral recumbency or sternal recumbency. We prefer positioning the animals in sternal recumbency. The formula should be delivered at a pace found acceptable to the squirrel, as feeding the animal too quickly can lead to the aspiration of the milk. Neonates should be fed every 2 hours, with a total volume of 3 ml/day. Anogenital stimulation should be performed after each feeding until the squirrel has urinated and defecated. Dehydrated orphans should be fed a balanced electrolyte solution for one or two feedings and gradually introduced to the milk formula over the following three to four feedings. Diarrhea and bloat commonly occur in animals that have reduced or hypermotile gastrointestinal transit times. When these problems occur, the volume of formula should be decreased.16 Neonates are messy feeders, and excess formula should be cleaned from their face after each feeding with a warm washcloth. After being fed, neonatal squirrels will sleep until their next feeding. Once a squirrel's eyes have been open for about a week (25-28 days old), begin offering formula from a shallow dish (<0.5 inches deep) every other feeding. When a squirrel readily drinks formula from the dish, discontinue syringe feeding. At the same time, begin to offer other natural foods (e.g., nuts and pine cones) and rodent chow. Rodent chow is the preferred food type to offer, as it is a balanced rodent diet. At 2 months of age, the animal should begin to be acclimated for release. Squirrels received during the late fall should be overwintered until the spring, and spring-born orphans should be released in the early summer to ensure that they will have the time to develop the skills necessary to survive in the weather.",

Orphaned lagomorphs can be reared on powdered milk replacers (e.g., Esbilac; PetAg, Hampshire, IL) or goat's milk. As milk replacers are a nutritional compromise, hand-reared lagomorphs need to be fed more than one time per day and the milk replacer should not be dilute beyond a 2 : 1 (formula-to-water) ratio. In captivity, most young lagomorphs will accept two to four feedings a day, depending on their weight, appetite and general condition. The volume consumed per feeding will also vary based on age and general condition, with animals accepting between 2 and 30 ml of milk per feeding. Orphaned rabbits should be weighed daily using an accurate digital scale. The most common problem encountered with these animals is aspiration of the milk replacer and the development of diarrhea. Aspiration can occur when tubing these animals or forcing the fluids through the tube so fast that they backflow up the esophagus and enter the trachea. Affected animals should immediately be given furosemide and broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfadimethoxine). Rabbits that develop enteritis should also be given antibiotics. In the wild, such a problem does not generally occur because of the rabbit's unique physiology. Juvenile rabbits are unusual among mammals in that they naturally have very few microorganisms in their stomach and small intestine while suckling. A natural antimicrobial fatty acid, or \u201cmilk oil,\u201d is present in the stomach of a suckling rabbit, which is produced by an enzymatic reaction in the doe's milk.6 This milk oil gives some protection against enteric infection. Orphaned rabbits that are fed a milk replacer do not develop this antimicrobial factor and are therefore susceptible to developing an enteric bacterial infection during nursing.",

Because of this, one of us (Mitchell) has developed a general set of rules for evaluating hematologic and plasma biochemistry results for wildlife. Regardless of the species, white blood cell counts are generally between 5000 and 15,000 cells/ml in clinically healthy patients. By establishing a basic range of values, the veterinarian can develop a comfort zone for what is or is not acceptable. It is important, however, to realize that animals with white blood cell counts within this range can be suffering from disease. This would be no different if there was an established \u201cnormal\u201d reference range for a particular species based on a rigorous study. There can always be abnormal patients within a normal distribution and normal patients that fall out of a mean \u00b12 standard deviations. The way to ultimately determine healthy versus nonhealthy is to evaluate the entire white blood cell count (e.g., differential) and examine the patient. There are two generic reasons that white blood cell counts can be elevated: inflammation and stress. Many veterinarians want to naturally label the elevation as infection or stress, but this would not be appropriate. If veterinarians always consider a white blood cell count to be associated with an infection, they will miss other potential causes of inflammation (e.g., trauma, neoplasia, toxins) and overprescribe antibiotics. When interpreting the differential it is important to first identify the predominant cell (neutrophil/heterophil or the lymphocyte). In most species, the heterophil (e.g., reptile, amphibian, avian) or neutrophil (e.g., mammal) will be the predominant cell, whereas within certain groups (e.g., chelonians, deer) the lymphocyte is the predominant cell. In general, the ratio of the predominant cell to the secondary cell will be 1 : 1 to 3 : 1. Therefore, in a clinically healthy raptor the ratio of heterophils to lymphocytes may be as low 1 : 1 or as high as 3 : 1, whereas the inverse may be said for a chelonian. If the ratio is outside of these parameters, the veterinarian must decide if one cell is elevated, the other decreased, or both. Lymphocyte counts in wildlife less than 1500 cells/ml are consistent with lymphopenia. Monocyte, basophil, and eosinophil counts are generally less than 500 cells/ml. Monocyte counts between 500-1200 cells/ml are generally associated with stress, while counts greater than 1200 cells/ml are strongly suggestive of chronic inflammation.

Many wildlife veterinary hospitals utilize radiographs as a parallel component to the physical examination. Survey radiographs are often invaluable for assessing musculoskeletal injuries and the presence of foreign bodies (e.g., fish hooks, lead shot) (Figure 19-11\n). Radiographs can even be used to characterize infectious disease. For example, raptors with systemic aspergillosis often have an increased radiopacity associated with their air sacs. Those types of radiographic findings direct us to perform coelioscopy. When pursuing radiographs, it is important to always take at least two different images (e.g., lateral and dorsoventral). Attempts to interpret a single radiograph can lead to misclassification. Animals that are fractious should be anesthetized. Any movement during the procedure will result in less than diagnostic images.",

For example, 7.5- to 12-MHz transducers should be used for small patients (e.g., mink), while 5- to 7.5-MHz units can be used for larger animals (e.g., bear).

The microbiologic cultures collected from wildlife can be processed using the same techniques described for domestic species. More species-specific information regarding culture techniques is available in other chapters of this book. It is important for veterinarians to establish a relationship with a microbiology laboratory. The laboratory scientists should be made aware of the different types of patients the veterinarians are working with, as the isolation of certain organisms requires more specialized techniques (e.g., Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella spp.). Interpreting the results of a culture should be done carefully. Just because an organism was isolated from an animal does not necessarily infer that it is causing disease. Cytologic examination or histopathologic testing of a wound that confirms the presence of a uniform population of organisms consistent with an isolate would certainly lend more strength to the association. Discussing the findings with the laboratory can also be beneficial. The laboratory may be able to provide insight into the growth and density of the organism on the plate or growth of secondary organisms that might be useful for case management.",

Veterinarians should always wear gloves when working with wildlife to minimize the likelihood of being infested with these organisms. Animals infested with ectoparasites should be treated with an appropriate antiparasitic. Fipronil can be used to eliminate ectoparasites on reptiles and birds. It is best, however, to be cautious when applying the drug to a species for the first time. This topical spray can be used for mesopredators.

This can have an overall deleterious effect on the population.
