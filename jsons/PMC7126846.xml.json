During the process of ageing, alterations in the immunological system lead to increased morbidity and mortality because of infections and age-related diseases, a process called immunosenescence. Among these changes are decreased a proliferative response of blood mononuclear cells, reduced peripheral blood lymphocyte numbers, including those of B, T, and CD4 + T helper cells, increased CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and a consequent decrease in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio (Franceschi et al., 2000; Day, 2010; Bauer and Fuente, 2016). Although the focus of immunosenescence characterization is acquired immunity, changes in innate immunity components may also contribute to a generalized decline in immune function during senescence (Greeley et al., 2001).",

Innate immunity acts concurrently with adaptative immunity and is characterized by a rapid response to injury, regardless of previous stimulus (Sigal and Ron, 1994). Adaptative immunity is induced by cellular memory as a result of exposure to microorganisms or antigens and is very effective at preventing infection propagation (Samartin and Chandra, 2001).",

Among the dietary components with the potential to modulate and stimulate the immune response, the yeast cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Swanson et al., 2002; Grieshop, 2002; Han et al., 2017) and its active fractions, such as mannanoligosaccharides (MOSs) and beta-glucans (Brown and Gordon, 2001; Goodridge et al., 2009; Middelbos et al., 2007), can be highlighted. The yeast cell wall comprises \u03b2-(1,3)-d-glucan, \u03b2-(1,6)-d-glucan, chitin, and mannoproteins (Koll\u00e1r et al., 1997), all of which have potential action on the immune system. Due to differences in the structures and proportions of functional carbohydrates, it is believed that these fractions have diverse immunoregulatory properties (Che et al., 2012).",

In weaned pigs experimentally infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, the supplementation of mannoproteins increased serum concentrations of inflammatory mediators (interleukin-1, interleukin-12, and haptoglobin) that are important in boosting innate and acquired cell-mediated immunity (Che et al., 2012).",

The treatments resulted from the combination of age (adults and elderly) and diet (T0, T400, and T800), generating six experimental treatments. Six adult dogs (4.0 \u00b1 2.0 years old and 11.79 \u00b1 0.05 kg) and six elderly dogs (11 \u00b1 1.0 years old and 12.10 \u00b1 0.07 kg) were used for each diet. The health status of the dogs was verified at the beginning of the study through a physical exam, complete blood count, and copro-parasitological examinations. Immediately before the experiment, animals were vaccinated with a polyvalent vaccine (Duramune Max - 5CvK/4 L, Fort Dodge Sa\u00fade Animal, Campinas, Brazil; a polyvalent vaccine against parvovirus, distemper, adenovirus-2, hepatitis, parainfluenza, coronavirus, and leptospirosis comprising L. canicola, L. icterohaemorrhagiae, L. gripppotyphosa, and L. pomona) and an antirabic vaccine (Canigen R, Virbac Sa\u00fade Animal, Sao Paulo, Brazil).",

Regardless of age and diet, a time effect was noted for H2O2 production by neutrophils, which was increased on day 28 compared to day 1 (P < 0.05). NO production in LPS stimulated neutrophils higher on day 1 than day 28 and a tendency for non-treated cells. When neutrophils were stimulated with LPS, dogs fed the T400 diet tended to produce more H2O2 than dogs consuming the control diet (P = 0.093). There were no effects regarding the production of H2O2 or NO by monocytes.",

The T cells then respond with the production of helper T lymphocytes (Th1) that recognize the antigen in the skin and accumulate around it, and then, an inflammatory response develops (Tizard, 2009). It is known that elderly dogs present less na\u00efve T cells and more memory T cells than young dogs (Fujiwara et al., 2012; Tizard, 2009). However, Fujiwara et al. (2012) did not find differences between memory T cell levels when comparing dogs of 2, 6, and 10 years of age.",

            "text": "Constant IgA production, which is secreted in large amounts on the intestinal mucosal surface, occurs because of continuous stimulation by the intestinal microbiota (Gomes et al., 2011). Beneficial bacteria indirectly affect the immune system by producing substances with immunostimulatory properties that interact with the immune system in many ways, including cytokine production, mononuclear cell proliferation, macrophagic phagocytosis, and induction of immunoglobulin synthesis (Macfarlane and Cummings, 1999). Therefore, the influence of diet may be better understood by evaluating the microbiota present in the intestinal lumen after addition of mannoproteins. Although current research has not evaluated this parameter, a study performed by Swanson et al. (2002) demonstrated that supplementation with 0.3 % MOS positively influenced microbial populations, with a tendency for increasing the abundance of Lactobacillus spp., along with a tendency to increase serum IgA and ileal IgA levels when associated with intake of fructooligosacharides (FOSs). Middelbos et al. (2007) reported increased ileal IgA with the addition of 0.25 % yeast cell wall. By studying the oral intake of 225 mg of beta-1,3/1,6-glucans in the form of tablets, Stuyven et al. (2010) found a significant reduction in salivary and lacrimal IgA and suggested that this decrease was due to production of Th1 cells induced by the cytokines IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 secreted after interaction of beta-glucan with the dectin-1 receptor.",

Both complement each other to guarantee defence against infectious agents and foreign substances, and both take part in an integrated immune system, acting in cooperation for defence (Abbas et al., 2011). Characteristic mechanisms by which active mannoprotein fractions act on immunity, however, are not known. Immune modulation as a result of prebiotics intake appears to act on GALT, secondary lymphoid tissues, and peripheral cells, according to Schley and Field (2002), possibly because of direct contact with lactic acid bacteria, products of the cell wall or cytoplasmic components of intestinal cells, by production of short-chain fatty acids derived from fermentation, or through mucin production changes. Mansour et al. (2002) established that AFMs act by binding to mannose receptors in macrophages, which serve as a link between the innate and acquired immune responses, and the MOS fraction acts to activate macrophages by occupying mannose receptor sites of glycoproteins on their cell surface. Once these sites are occupied, a chain reaction begins, resulting in the activation of macrophages and cytokine secretion.",

Elderly dogs are affected by the immunosenescence process, as evidenced by a decrease in lymphocytic counts and the proliferation ability of these cells.
