            "text": "Viruses are obligate parasites that depend on the host cell to provide the energy and molecular precursors necessary for successful infection. A wide variety of evolutionarily divergent viruses have evolved mechanisms that target the host cell metabolic network as part of their infectious programs, and virally induced metabolic activities are commonly exploited for therapeutic intervention. For example, numerous different nucleotide metabolic activities are targeted by a variety of pharmaceuticals to treat viral infections, including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), varicella-zoster Virus (VZV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Table 1\n) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In recent years, the number of metabolic activities that have been found to be important for viral infection has expanded. Further, our understanding of the viral mechanisms through which viruses usurp cellular metabolic resources has increased. Many of these viral mechanisms stimulate nutrient uptake and catabolism to support the production of viral progeny. In addition to providing the energy and biomass necessary for turning cells into productive \u2018virus factories\u2019, new metabolic contributions to infection have emerged. These include small-molecule enzymatic activities that organize viral maturation compartments, synthesize specialized virion components, or regulate the immunological environment (Figure 1\n). Such virally induced metabolic changes do not go unnoticed by the host, but rather represent a major host\u2013pathogen interaction that can sway infectious outcomes. Collectively, recent findings have made it clear that the landscape for metabolically targeted therapeutic intervention has expanded.",

A number of DNA viruses induce glycolysis, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) [6], HCMV [7], adenovirus [8], human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) [9]. Multiple RNA viruses also activate glycolytic flux, including dengue [10], hepatitis C (HCV), [11] and influenza A [12].

KSHV employs specific viral microRNAs targeting known regulators of glucose metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis to induce glycolytic activity [6]. HCMV has been shown to induce the activity of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) [16], which regulates numerous glycolytic activities [17]. HCMV-mediated activation of AMPK was found to be necessary for glycolytic activation and high-titer infection [16]. HCMV has also been shown to induce a pro-glycolytic transcriptional program through activation of a host transcription factor, chREBP, which induces the expression of numerous glycolytic enzymes, and is important for virally mediated activation of glycolysis [18].",

Many of the viruses that activate glycolysis also induce increased concentrations of TCA cycle components during infection. HCMV activates both the TCA cycle and glycolysis simultaneously, using glycolytic carbon to feed the TCA cycle and ultimately produce fatty acids that are important for infection [7]. Similarly to HCMV, vaccinia virus induces increased glutamine catabolism [13], and both HCMV and vaccinia are dependent on increased glutamine catabolism for high-titer infection 13, 19 (Figure 2). In contrast, HSV-1 does not substantially impact glycolysis, but induces pyruvate carboxylation to anaplerotically replenish TCA cycle metabolites while diverting other TCA intermediates towards pyrimidine biosynthesis [14]. In comparison to glycolysis, less is known about how various viral infections impact specific TCA cycle metabolic fluxes. Measuring TCA cycle metabolic activity is difficult due to the number of metabolic fluxes that flow into and out of the cycle. Additionally, many TCA intermediates are compartmentalized into both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial pools, further complicating metabolic inquiry.",

The HCMV UL37 protein also disrupts the reticular mitochondrial network and blocks mitochondrial apoptotic signaling [24]. While many of these activities are anti-apoptotic, with clear pro-viral consequences, they would also be predicted to have substantial effects on mitochondrial metabolism, including TCA cycle activity and cellular energetics, which are likely also important for viral infection.

Inhibition of ACC1 or fatty acid synthase (FASN) attenuates HCMV replication at a late stage of infection without impacting viral protein accumulation 7, 25. The late timing of this defect is consistent with a role for fatty acid biosynthesis in viral assembly or envelopment. During HCMV infection, the induction of fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes is mediated by viral activation of the sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) 1 and 2 25, 27, transcription factors that control the expression of fatty acid metabolic genes. Vaccinia infection is also sensitive to ACC1 or FASN inhibition. Pharmacological inhibition of either ACC or FASN strongly reduces viral titers and inhibits virion envelopment in a manner that could be partially rescued by the addition of exogenous palmitate, the key product of fatty acid biosynthesis [26].",

JEV inhibits MTP through its NS5 protein [33], while HCMV redirects the cellular viperin protein to inhibit MTP [34]. In contrast to these viruses that inhibit fatty acid oxidation, HCV infection requires fatty acid oxidation for its replication, which again highlights that certain aspects of viral metabolic manipulation are virus specific [35]. Combined, the data indicate that virally mediated manipulation of lipid metabolism is broadly important to viral infection, and further, that viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to ensure that the host-cell lipid metabolic machinery is co-opted to support viral infection.",

In many cases, the exact contributions that specific lipid metabolic enzymes make towards viral infection are unclear; however, certain themes are emerging. Increasingly, it appears that viruses are targeting host-cell lipid-modifying enzymes as a means to organize viral assembly and maturation compartments (Figure 1). This theme is readily apparent in recent work on the replication complexes formed by plus-strand RNA viruses. Dengue virus, HCV, and rhinovirus all remodel the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to generate sites for their replication using mechanisms that rely on host lipid biosynthesis. The dengue virus NSP3 protein specifically recruits fatty acid synthase to viral replication sites, which is critical for dengue replication 31, 36. For HCV, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha (PI4KA) is an important host factor for the formation of replication compartments [37]. HCV stimulates PI4KA activity, likely through its interaction with the HCV NS5A, which induces accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) in the ER and allows for productive replication [37]. Similarly, rhinovirus replication requires redistribution of PI4P and cholesterol in ER and Golgi membranes [38]. Despite the similar lipid requirements of these related viruses, their respective ER-derived replication compartments are each unique in both conformation and size [39]. Further investigation may reveal virus-specific lipid requirements driving the formation of these structures that could be therapeutically exploitable 40, 41.",

These VLCFAs are concentrated in the envelope of HCMV virions 45, 46.

Further, the infectivity of both HSV and HCMV relies on specific glycosylation of their envelope glycoproteins 59, 60. HCMV has recently been found to increase the biosynthesis of various UDP-sugars, the molecular subunits that supply glycosylation reactions, by funneling increased pyrimidine biosynthesis towards UDP-sugar biosynthesis [61]. Inhibition of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis attenuates envelope protein glycosylation, depletes UDP-sugar pools in an infection-specific manner and reduces viral titers [61]. Protein glycosylation modifications are varied and complex, so while it is clear that viral protein glycosylation is targeted by, and critical for, viral infection, numerous questions remain about how specific glycosylation patterns contribute to virus infectivity, and whether specific UDP-glycosyl transferases are recruited for modification of viral proteins.",

Sphingolipids are a diverse family of bioactive lipid species that play a role in a variety of immune processes such as lymphocyte migration, mast cell regulation, and apoptotic control (reviewed in [65]). The levels of bioactive sphingolipids, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide, are induced at early time points during the HCMV life cycle and were found to be important for infection [62]. HCV infection also induces expression of sphingomyelin synthases and increases sphingolipid synthesis, which, if blocked, attenuates infection [63]. Sphingolipids represent a nexus point of cellular immunological processes, with their individual small molecules participating in a variety of context-dependent signaling events. Induction of sphingolipid pools during viral infection can potentially aid infection in a variety of ways, from enhancing cell proliferation and survival to providing lipid components for replication compartments.",

Prostaglandins have been shown to inhibit a number of viral families, including poxviruses, some herpesviruses, and retroviruses 66, 67. However, HCMV induces the expression of the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme of prostaglandin biosynthesis, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) [68]. The induction of COX2 activity increases the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which is important for high-titer infection [69]. Further, other primate cytomegaloviruses have acquired COX2 genes from their host, and these virally expressed homologs are important for viral replication in specific contexts [70]. Influenza A virus also upregulates PGE2 during infection, which leads to an inhibition of interferon production and decreases in antigen presentation and T cell-mediated immunity [71].

Given the importance of the metabolic network to infection, it follows that viral tropism could be shaped by underlying tissue-specific metabolic differences. The tropic differences displayed by retrovirus family members present one such example. All retroviruses are capable of replicating in dividing cells, whereas only lentiviruses, for example, HIV-1, are capable of replicating in non-dividing cells, such as macrophages. The levels of dNTPs are a major metabolic distinction between quiescent non-dividing cells, such as macrophages, and rapidly dividing cells, with macrophages exhibiting \u223c100\u2013200-fold reduced concentrations of dNTP precursors relative to CD4 T cells [72]. Comparative biochemical analysis of reverse transcriptases (RTs) expressed by HIV-1 versus those expressed by a variety of retroviruses unable to replicate in macrophages, demonstrate that HIV-1 RT has a much higher dNTP-binding affinity than those of non-macrophage-tropic retroviruses [72]. This elevated dNTP binding was found to be functionally important for macrophage tropism, as HIV-1 mutants that possessed RT with the reduced retroviral enzymatic kinetics were unable to replicate in macrophages but retained the ability to replicate in dividing CD4 T cells [72]. A more comprehensive review of retroviral tropism and nucleotide pools can be found in [73]. As we broaden our understanding of how host cell metabolism contributes to viral infection, the impact of tissue-specific metabolic differences on the ability of viruses to grow in different cell types will likely become increasingly apparent.",

New studies continue to identify novel ways in which other small-molecule-based signaling contributes to immunity. One such example is the discovery of the interferon-induced enzyme cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H), which produces oxysterols such as 25-hydroxycholesterol that regulate immune responses 82, 83. Increased CH25H activity disrupts HCV genome replication by interfering with the SREBP lipid biosynthetic transcription factors and attenuating host lipid synthesis 84, 85. Other examples of small-molecule immunoregulatory activities include recent findings that intracellular metabolites signal to immune cells upon extracellular release, for example, during apoptosis or necrosis. Release of extracellular nucleotides serves as a \u2018find-me\u2019 signal that recruits monocytes and macrophages [86]. Examples such as these strongly argue that the intracellular and extracellular small-molecule environment can shape immunity. However, the field is still at a very early stage; many questions remain about the specific mechanisms involved (see Outstanding Questions).",

            "text": "A number of the virally induced metabolic changes mentioned above mirror metabolic changes that occur during oncogenesis. Despite arising from diverse tissue types, cancerous cells display relatively similar metabolic programs that include activation of glycolysis, induction of nucleotide biosynthesis, and activation of fatty acid biosynthesis 87, 88, 89. Many viruses, including HBV [90], HPV 91, 92, 93, HCV 11, 15, 94, and KSHV 6, 95, 96, which play direct causal roles in human tumorigenesis, induce these various metabolic activities. The contributions that these metabolic changes make towards oncogenesis, regardless of any infectious etiology, have become a major focus in cancer biology research (reviewed in [97]). To some extent, the shared metabolic phenotypes associated with oncogenesis and viral infection likely reflect common proliferative goals between cancer cells and viruses, that is, creation of large amounts of energy and biomass for the production of progeny. However, common metabolic phenotypes between infected cells and cancer-derived cell lines also present challenges. The study of viral infection occurs predominately in the context of cancer-derived cell lines. Given their metabolic similarities, it is perhaps unsurprising that transformed cell lines produce higher viral titers relative to non-transformed tissue. However, in studying viral replication in these cells, viral metabolic phenotypes become difficult to discern from the underlying metabolic contributions associated with oncogenesis. Further, important contributions of specific viral factors responsible for driving viral metabolic reprogramming are likely be missed when studied in a cancer-cell background which already exhibits these metabolic changes. In more physiologically relevant systems, the contributions made by these factors would be evident, and could be studied with an eye towards therapeutic intervention. To avoid complications such as these, ideally, analysis of viral metabolic modulation should occur in the most physiologically relevant system possible, thereby moving away from study solely in transformed cells.",

            "text": "It is clear that viruses have evolved mechanisms to target host cell metabolism to ensure their persistence. In doing so, viruses usurp the host's small-molecule resources to provide energy and molecular building blocks to support infection. Viruses also target small-molecule metabolism to organize viral maturation compartments and to modulate immune responses. The host, however, is not a passive bystander with respect to viral metabolic manipulation. Rather, the host responds at various levels, including innate mechanisms to limit viral metabolic modulation in individually infected cells as well as metabolic immunosurveillance by the immune system. As such, control of the small-molecule network continues to emerge as a core host\u2013pathogen interaction that can determine the outcome of viral infection, making it a worthwhile goal to target viral-host metabolic regulation as a means to limit viral infection. Achieving this goal will be aided by a number of factors. First, continued elucidation of small-molecule metabolic activities that are important for viral infection, as well as the mechanisms through which they contribute to infection, will broaden the number of candidate therapeutic targets. Further, successful therapeutic development requires a sufficiently wide therapeutic window to limit viral replication without inducing toxicity. Targeting virally encoded metabolic activities has been a successful clinical strategy, for example various nucleotide analogs. However, viral enzymes can quickly evolve resistance to these targeted therapeutics, which necessitates cocktail-type therapies, increasing concerns about toxicity. Targeting host-cell metabolic activities would largely limit the ability for viruses to evolutionarily acquire resistance, but targeting host enzymes also raises concerns about potential toxicity. With these concerns in mind, virally induced host-lipid metabolic activities appear particularly attractive as candidates for therapeutic targeting, as a number of inhibitors of this type are already FDA-approved and are widely prescribed, such as the cholesterol-lowering statins.",
