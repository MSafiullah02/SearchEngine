            "text": "Currently, viruses are used as delivery vehicles in two different ways. Firstly, viral genomes have been manipulated so that foreign genes can be inserted and the modified genome packaged to generate virus particles that resemble the original viruses. These virions then follow the pathways used by the parental virus to infect a target cell. Such systems are well established for retroviral vectors, and for a variety of other virus systems including adeno-, adeno-associated virus, alpha-, vaccinia, and herpes virus. As an alternative strategy, components deemed to be required for viral entry have been isolated and used to facilitate delivery. For example, the influenza envelope glycoprotein, haemagglutinin (HA), has been used to make virosomes (liposomes containing reconstituted viral membrane proteins that can be loaded with peptides, drugs, DNA, etc.) that are as effective for fusion as the original virions 27, 199, 217, 225. Peptides representing an HA fusion motif have been coupled to DNA and used to deliver genes to tissue culture cells 169, 221. Similarly, inactivated adenovirus\u2013ligand\u2013DNA conjugates, in which the virus acts as a carrier and not an infectious particle, have been developed [145]. Although these systems work well in tissue culture, and in some cases in vivo, they lack the specificity and efficiency required for clinical applications. In many cases these limitations are associated with the process of entry of the vehicle into cells. Thus a more detailed understanding of virus entry may suggest ways in which existing delivery systems can be improved or novel ones developed.",

            "text": "Viruses have evolved many strategies to invade cells. In a few cases the cellular and molecular details are reasonably well understood, but for most viruses little is known. Nevertheless, the well-studied systems have established paradigms against which other viruses can be compared. The entry strategies used by different viruses are determined primarily by the structure of the virus. Viruses are either enveloped or non-enveloped. Enveloped viruses contain the viral genome and core proteins wrapped within one or more membranes. These membranes are acquired from the host cell during virus assembly and budding [166]. Many enveloped viruses, such as the orthomyxo- (e.g., influenza), paramyxo- (e.g., Sendai), rhabdo- (e.g., vesicular stomatitis virus), retro- (e.g., human immunodeficiency, [HIV]) and alphaviruses [e.g., Semliki Forest virus (SFV)]), contain a single membrane. Other viruses, such as herpes virus, may undergo several budding and fusion steps with different intracellular membrane compartments before finally acquiring a single membrane from the exocytic pathway. In contrast, vaccinia virus (a member of the Poxviruses) acquires several membranes by interaction with different membrane compartments in the infected cell 183, 192, 214. The composition of the viral membrane(s) varies for different viruses and is determined by (i) the complement of virally encoded membrane or envelope proteins and (ii) the content of host cell lipid and proteins. The latter reflects (i) the degree to which cellular proteins are incorporated into the budding virion and (ii) the composition of the membrane system where budding occurs [different viruses assemble and bud in different cellular locations, for example the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), intermediate compartment, Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane [166]].",

            "text": "Enveloped viruses use membrane fusion to penetrate a cell [239]. The viral membrane fuses with a cellular membrane so that the genome-containing viral capsid or core is transferred to the cytosol. Membrane fusion is one of the most frequent reactions occurring in eukaryotic cells. Cell-to-cell fusions, such as sperm\u2013oocyte or myoblast fusion, are topologically closely related to virus entry [240]. However, membrane fusion events occur at higher frequency inside cells as vesicles transporting membrane and cargo between intracellular organelles are formed and consumed [177]. In principle, the cycle of virus assembly and fusion is similar to that of transport vesicle formation and consumption. Recently membrane proteins on the transport vesicle and the target membrane (the so-called vesicle (v)- and target (t)-SNARES) have been implicated as receptors that ensure transport vesicles fuse with the correct compartment [177]. Similarly, the membrane of enveloped viruses must also contain the components required for (i) binding to, and (ii) fusing with a target cell.",

However, unlike enveloped viruses, non-enveloped viruses must rely on strategies other than fusion. In general, proteins and protein complexes are not spontaneously transported across membranes but require complex molecular machines for translocation. The mechanisms through which the protein shells of non-enveloped viruses interact with cell membranes are not well understood, and there is no single principle analogous to fusion. Picornaviruses bind to cell-surface components that can dock into `canyon-like' depressions on the surface of the virion 155, 176. Following endocytosis, the virions appear to generate pores in the endosome membrane that allow the viral RNA to exit from the virion and penetrate to the cytoplasm without complete disassembly of the capsid or disruption of the endosomal membrane [171]. Receptor binding may initiate changes in the capsid structure that facilitate pore formation. In contrast, adenoviruses employ fibres that project from the virion surface to bind to cellular receptors. After initial adsorption to the cell surface, adenoviruses bind to vitronectin-binding integrins and undergo endocytosis through coated vesicles. Within endosomes the low pH activates a lysin on the virus that disrupts the endosome membrane allowing the virion and other endosomal contents into the cytoplasm where the viral capsid is subsequently disassembled 78, 79.",

Which of these sites is used varies for different virus families. The fusion reactions of enveloped viruses are mediated by specific virally encoded envelope proteins. These fusion proteins are displayed on the virion in metastable forms that must be activated to initiate fusion. For alpha-, orthomyxo-, and rhabdoviruses, at least, fusion is triggered by exposure of the fusion proteins to low pH and thus usually occurs only after virions have undergone endocytosis into acidic endocytic organelles. Fusion is activated in early (pH>6.0) or late endosomes (pH<6.0) depending on the pH requirement of the specific envelope protein [102]. For these viruses endocytosis is essential for infection.",

Some pH-independent viruses appear to be capable of fusion across a range of pH values 129, 239and may potentially fuse at the cell surface or within endocytic organelles. The pH optimum for cell-to-cell fusion mediated by the envelope protein (Env) of a T cell line-adapted HIV-1 strain is around pH 7.5, well above the pH of endosomes [70], and such strains of HIV-1 enter HeLa-CD4 cells by fusion at the cell surface 156, 165.

Similarly, a murine ecotropic retrovirus is apparently pH-independent for entry on some cell types but pH-dependent on others [130]. The causes of these differences are unclear. Penetration may depend on conditions other than the pH of intracellular organelles. For example, endosomal proteases have been suggested to activate Moloney murine leukemia virus fusion [4]. Thus although pH-dependent viruses only penetrate from endocytic organelles, it should not be assumed that pH-independent viruses only penetrate at the cell surface.",

Though their modes of action differ, all these agents raise the pH of acidic organelles and inhibit pH-dependent viral penetration 85, 100. They do not directly affect pH-independent viruses [129], though they may influence infection indirectly. Modulation of endosomal pH, for example, can affect vesicular transport between endocytic compartments. The weak base primaquine interferes with recycling from endosomes 89, 204, while neutralisation of endosomes appears to inhibit transport from early to late endosomes under some circumstances [39]. Blockade of this latter step, using specific antibodies, can inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus infection [242]. Thus perturbation of intracellular transport by agents that neutralise intracellular organelles may prevent viruses from reaching sites necessary for penetration or infection. The pH-neutralising agents can also perturb the assembly of viruses by neutralising exocytic compartments in cells (see, for example, Ref. [129]). Thus entry experiments that use release of infectious virus as a read-out should be designed so that the agents are only present during the time of virus entry.",

The primate lentiviruses carry one species of virally encoded envelope protein (Env\u2014gp120/gp41), but pick up a range of cellular proteins during assembly, including MHC class II antigens [9]. Although not essential, these additional proteins may facilitate binding to a host cell and may be targets for antibodies with apparent antiviral activities [9].

The 3D structure of HA (from the X-31 strain of influenza virus), complexed with sialyllactose, has been resolved by X-ray diffraction. In this structure sialic acid completely fills the pocket and is co-ordinated by residues that line the cavity [231]. The receptor interactions with canyon-like sites on the surfaces of picornaviruses, in particular rhinoviruses, have also been structurally determined by crystallography and electron microscopy 155, 176. For many other viruses, however, information on receptor binding is less direct. For example, extensive studies of HIV-1 Env using soluble forms of the major receptor for the virus, CD4, and anti-Env monoclonal antibodies have identified continuous and discontinuous epitopes that are likely to be involved in CD4 binding (Ref. [142]and references therein). These studies suggest the CD4 binding site is assembled from different regions of the gp120 molecule, some of which are far apart on the linear sequence.",

Many virus receptors are members of the immunoglobulin super family, molecules that are often implicated in recognition events; others are transporters, components of the glycocalyx, adhesion molecules, etc. Among the receptors for retroviruses alone, molecules such as CD4, multimembrane-spanning transporters and a glycolipid-anchored homologue of the LDLR are used by viruses with similar SU\u2013TM complexes. This disparity notwithstanding, one unifying trait among these interactions has been suggested: three crucial residues in CD4, the ecotropic MuLV receptor (cationic amino acid transporter) and the ALV receptor (LDLR-related protein) encompass one aromatic residue and at least one charged residue which may reflect similarities in well-adapted modes of viral receptor binding 233, 256, 261.",

Together the data suggested that HIV-1 required at least one other factor for infection 10, 34, 56, 119. It was also recognised that there might be multiple accessory factors as the primate lentiviruses were shown to differ in their capacity to infect different CD4+ve cells. HIV-1 isolated early in the course of infection can usually infect macrophages and primary T cells, but seldom T-cell lines.

The initial suggestion that chemokine receptors might be involved in virus entry came from the identification of CC (\u03b2) chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1, and MIP-1\u03b2) as HIV-suppressive factors secreted by CD8+ve T cells [40]. Furthermore, lymphocytes from individuals who had been multiply exposed to HIV-1 but remained uninfected showed a resistance to infection by macrophage tropic forms of HIV-1 that was associated with increased secretion of RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1, and MIP-1\u03b2 [164]. Subsequently, the chemokine receptor now called CXCR4 (previously termed LESTR, HUMSTR and Fusin) was identified as an entry co-factor for T cell line-adapted HIV-1 16, 65. CXCR4 has since been shown to bind the CXC (\u03b1) chemokine stromal cell derived factor 1[SDF-1] 19, 153. Other chemokine receptors were later identified as co-receptors for various strains of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV. In particular, CCR5, which binds RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1, and MIP-1\u03b2, is used by primary macrophage tropic strains of HIV-1 and by SIV viruses 33, 35, 54, 57, 120, while CCR3 and CCR2b can be used by dualtropic virus (virus which can infect both lymphocytes and macrophages).

As discussed above, the primate lentiviruses are all pH-independent for entry 129, 130, 201. The organisation of the fusogenic envelope glycoprotein (Env) of these viruses resembles that of influenza HA (see below). During fusion Env (which contains a membrane bound subunit\u2014gp41 or TM, and a non-covalently associated soluble subunit\u2014gp120 or SU) must undergo a conformational change which at least functionally resembles the acid-induced conformational changes that trigger HA mediated fusion. However, the conformational changes in Env occur at neutral pH. CD4 binding can induce conformational changes in HIV-1 Env that lead to exposure of epitopes associated with gp41 and the V3 loop of gp120 61, 183, and may modulate the interaction between gp120 and gp41 [141]. How these changes relate to the fusion is still under investigation. However, a view is emerging that CD4-induced conformational changes in Env, including reorientation of the V3 loop, allow the Env/CD4 complex to bind to a given chemokine receptor 215, 252and that the chemokine receptor can then complete the conformational changes in Env required for fusion (Fig. 2). In many respects it is likely that the chemokine receptors are essential for virus entry, as some tissue culture strains of virus can dispense with the need for CD4 but still require an appropriate chemokine receptor [62]. Thus the role of CD4 is to recruit the virus to the cell surface and induce the formation of the chemokine receptor binding site on gp120/SU. While it is now well established that Env, CD4 and a chemokine receptor are generally essential in HIV entry, a specific role for additional cell-surface molecules cannot yet be ruled out.",

Following budding, the clathrin coat is removed through the action of an uncoating ATPase and the vesicles fuse with early endosomes. From endosomes, membrane and content can be recycled to the cell surface or delivered to other cellular destinations, including late endosomes and lysosomes, the Golgi apparatus and, in specialised cells, synaptic vesicles, MHC class II-containing compartments and alternative plasma membrane domains (see Ref.

Recent evidence suggests these structures are more widespread and that they have a role in the clustering and signalling pathways associated with GPI-linked and other membrane proteins [112]. The integrity of caveolae appears to depend on the presence of cholesterol and a cholesterol-binding protein Vip21/caveolin [161]. Initially, it was proposed that these structures might transiently invaginate, in a process termed photocytosis [6]. More recently it has become apparent that caveolae can undergo actin-dependent internalisation in cells treated with the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid [162]. The role of this internalisation is uncertain and there is no evidence that caveolae are delivered to the endocytic pathway. However, internalised caveolae appear to be relocated to the perinuclear region adjacent to the microtubule-organising centre and may interact with the ER [190].",

Early morphological studies showed that class I antigens could be associated with small non-clathrin coated invaginations of the plasma membrane [91]. In retrospect, these invaginations might have been caveolae. However, class I antigens have also been implicated as receptors for SFV [86], a virus that clearly uses the clathrin-mediated route for endocytosis [124]. Thus MHC class I antigens might internalise through different endocytic routes [118], or different viruses might direct these receptors to specific endocytic carriers, possibly through association with other co-receptor molecules. Although implicated in SV40 entry, a role for caveolae in the uptake of other viruses remains to be established.",

            "text": "HA is assembled in the ER of infected cells from a single precursor polypeptide (HAO) of approximately 560 amino acids. The protein undergoes N-linked glycosylation, trimerisation and folding within the ER, and only when the protein has folded correctly is it released by the ER quality control system for transport to the Golgi and plasma membrane. The folding and assembly of HA have been studied extensively and involve the combined activities of a set of ER chaperones 24, 122, 210. En route to the cell surface the oligosaccharides are modified to complex forms, and each HAO molecule is proteolytically cleaved by furin or furin-type enzymes in the trans Golgi cisternae or trans Golgi network to generate the HA1 and HA2 subunits. The X-ray structure of HA shows that the mature protein contains two domains (i) the globular heads assembled from HA1 containing the sialic acid-binding sites and (ii) a stalk domain composed primarily of HA2 which supports the head domains. After cleavage, the newly generated N terminus of HA2 contains a stretch of conserved hydrophobic residues that is termed the `fusion peptide'. This segment is crucial for fusion; non-cleaved HA molecules are not fusion-competent. In the neutral pH form of HA, the fusion peptide is buried away from the solvent within the stalk structure about 3.5 nm from the viral membrane. The cleavage in part provides a mechanism to allow the HA trimer to transit the acidic compartments of the exocytic pathway, but it is also likely that correct folding and assembly of trimers can only be achieved with the full length precursor protein. The HA2 sequences form two long anti parallel \u03b1 helices linked by a loop. This region and its flanking \u03b1 helices contain several leucine-zipper heptad repeats. In other proteins similar sequences show a propensity to form coiled coils. As discussed below it appears that at least part of the HA conformational change during fusion involves the refolding of this loop region to form a coiled coil. Thus the HA protein can be regarded as being `spring-loaded', i.e. the full length HAO is assembled in a metastable conformation that can refold, after cleavage, when a critical stimulus (exposure to low pH) is applied.",

            "text": "How exactly the changes in HA occur and how they allow the molecule to interact with membranes to induce fusion is still unclear. The position of the fusion peptide at neutral pH close to the viral membrane initially posed a topological problem: How could the fusion peptide interact with the target membrane, when it is located 100 \u00c5 away from it? Modelling studies suggested that during fusion, when the loop structures of adjacent HA2 molecules are released by the protonation of residues involved in maintaining the trimeric structure, they would refold to form an energetically more favourable triple stranded coiled coil. This change would create a long extended helix and thereby relocate the fusion peptide 100 \u00c5 from within the stalk to the end of the rod where it could potentially interact with a target membrane [31]. Support for this model came with the resolution of the 3D structure of the acid form of a fragment of HA2 [29]. This structure showed reorganisation of the loop to an \u03b1-helix and relocation of the fusion peptide to the tip of the molecule. However, additional changes occur at the juxta-membrane end of the molecule. Part of the long helix in the neutral-pH structure is relocated such that it becomes anti-parallel to the rest of the helix. Thus the longitudinal helix of HA2 is prolonged and straightened out at the N terminus and truncated by bending at the C terminus [29]. Evidence supporting these changes in native HA has been gained from electron microscopy [237]. However, information on the structure of the C terminal region of HA2 is still missing and the orientation of the acid form of the protein with respect to the viral membrane is uncertain. The EM studies, like earlier photo-affinity labelling studies [230], suggested that the fusion peptide might interact with the HA-containing membrane, i.e. that at some stage at least the acid form of the protein might be inverted.",

Current data suggest that a minimum of three HA trimers is required to form a functional fusion complex [49]and that the transmembrane domain of HA is crucial for fusion. Using cell-to cell fusion assays, an HA molecule anchored to the membrane by a GPI moiety, rather than its usual transmembrane domain, will induce hemi-fusion\u2014a state in which the outer but not the inner leaflets of the bilayers are fused [97]. Experiments with amphipathes that selectively insert into either the inner or outer leaflet of membranes and change the curvature of that membrane, suggest that the normal transmembrane domain is required to exert pressure on the bilayer to drive a hemi-fusion intermediate to full fusion [131]. Full fusion proceeds through the formation of a narrow (1-2 nm diameter) pore that can be detected by the patch clamp technique 194, 195, 216. The initial pore formation follows after a short lag, but precedes lipid mixing [216]. The initial fusion pore flickers open and closed 194, 195before widening further to allow first the movement of lipids and subsequently the aqueous contents of the fusing cells to mix [20].",

Alphaviruses, such as SFV and the closely related Sindbis virus, are uniform in size (approximately 65 nm diameter) and regularly shaped. The SFV nucleocapsid comprises one RNA molecule and 240 copies of the capsid (C) protein. The capsid proteins interact with the viral RNA and each other to form an icosahedral nucleocapsid with a T=4 surface lattice 36, 159, 160. The SFV envelope contains 80 spike glycoproteins, each spike consisting of three E2E1 heterodimers [a small peptide, E3, resulting from proteolytic cleavage of P62 (see below) is lost from Sindbis virus spikes but remains non-covalently attached to the SFV spike complex]. The spikes are triangular and form, like the nucleocapsid, an icosahedral shell with a T=4 surface lattice 71, 220, suggesting that each spike glycoprotein heterodimer directly interacts with a capsid protein 132, 207. This interaction appears to be mediated through a conserved tyrosine in the cytoplasmic domain of E2 and a hydrophobic pocket on the capsid protein 188, 189. Chemical cross-linking studies on Sindbis virus suggest that each spike contains an inner core of the three E1 subunits and an outer shell formed by the three E2 subunits, an arrangement confirmed by cryo-electron microscopy 8, 72. A receptor-binding site in the spike complex has not yet been identified. However, a hydrophobic domain in E1 between amino acids 79 and 97 (for SFV) is highly conserved in alphaviruses [98], and is believed to be involved in fusion 58, 110.",

These spike proteins are also synthesised in precursor form. The E1 protein assembles together with the precursor of E2, the P62 protein. Three such dimers subsequently assemble to form a spike protein complex that is transported to the cell surface. Just prior to its arrival at the plasma membrane, the P62 protein is cleaved by a cellular protease to generate the E2 protein found in the mature spike glycoprotein [50]. The properties of the mature E2E1 heterodimers are distinctly different from the precursor P62E1 dimers. Exposure of E2E1 complexes to mildly acidic conditions results in dissociation of the subunits, whereas P62E1 complexes dissociate only upon exposure to pH values of 4.5\u20135.0 114, 115, 181, 222. Thus P62 appears to stabilise the immature spike complex and prevent premature activation during transport through the mildly acidic compartments of the exocytic pathway.",

However, the 3D structure of a native retroviral envelope protein has not yet been solved and current comparisons to HA should be regarded with some caution. Nevertheless, several studies have suggested that the retroviral envelope proteins form trimers 18, 64, 232. The retroviral transmembrane proteins contain N terminal hydrophobic sequences that resemble the HA fusion peptide (Fig. 3\n). Furthermore, domains with heptad repeats have been implicated in fusion 244, 247. Synthetic peptides representing sequences C-terminal to the fusion peptide have a strong propensity to form \u03b1 helices in solution 103, 246. Hence, it has been speculated that receptor binding can unleash conformational changes that involve the formation of coiled coils and exposure of the TM fusion peptide 18, 64, 116, 245. Synthetic peptides representing the HIV heptad repeats can block virus entry, perhaps by interfering with the ability of these regions to oligomerise during the fusion reaction [128]. The structure of an alpha helical domain from the extracellular portion of HIV-1 TM has been solved crystallographically [32]. This domain forms trimers of two interacting peptides. The N-terminal peptide, which contains heptad repeats, forms a trimeric coiled coil. Around this coiled coil the C-terminal peptides are wound such that they fit into the hydrophobic grooves on the coiled coil. This structure might position the HIV fusion peptide at the top of a protruding six helix bundle such that the fusion peptides could insert into a membrane. The structure shares some features with that of the low pH fragment of influenza virus HA and is suggested to represent the core of the fusion active gp41. Alternatively, the complex may represent the terminal structure of the TM/gp41 ectodomain achieved after a metastable intermediate has initiated membrane fusion.",

This indicates that the HIV proviral DNA, which has been reverse-transcribed from the RNA genome, is able to penetrate the intact nuclear membrane. The HIV pre-integration complex contains the viral matrix (MA) protein [203]. Recent studies have identified nuclear targeting signals in MA similar to those previously characterised in other cellular and viral proteins. MA is linked to the plasma membrane via an N-terminal myristic acid group. However, MA can be phosphorylated on multiple serine and tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation displaces MA from membranes, in a manner similar to that demonstrated for the MARCKS protein [212]. Thus MA-containing viral pre-integration complexes are likely to be released from the plasma membrane by phosphorylation of MA. The nature of the kinase(s) involved in these phosphorylation events is unclear, but serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase activity has been detected in highly purified HIV virions [203]. Thus the virus may package cellular kinases during assembly to facilitate its subsequent targeting to the nucleus.",

As discussed above the cortical cytoskeleton may present a barrier that the viral capsid has to traverse (Section 4.1). Other virally encoded proteins including integrase and the product of the vpr gene are also present in the pre-integration complex, though the capsid protein is not. Vpr also appears to be required for infection of non-dividing cells. Nuclear targeting signals have not been identified in this protein, although it is karyophilic [73].

A number of these systems have now reached the stage of clinical trials (for reviews see Refs. 7, 135). Vectors based on retroviruses, adeno- and herpesviruses, which will allow stable integration and expression of a given gene, have proved useful in vitro, but their therapeutic applicability has yet to be demonstrated. The molecular and cellular basis of viral entry and infection is now becoming increasingly well understood, and the knowledge gained from these studies is being used to develop improved vectors. For example, altered tropisms of C-type retroviruses have been attempted by creating chimeras between the outer envelope protein, SU, and ligands with the desired receptor specificity. While some of these viruses are not infectious because of blocks at post-receptor-binding steps of entry [44], others have given expanded viral tropism to, for example, integrin- and human MHC class I-expressing cells 121, 218. Virosomes containing reconstituted influenza, Sendai, VSV or EBV fusion proteins have proven to be effective delivery vehicles for DNA, drugs, peptides and toxins in tissue culture. Initial studies suggest some of these also work in animal models for the delivery of peptides to the cytoplasm of cells and presentation on MHC class I antigens. Future studies will undoubtedly allow more effective and more useful vectors to be developed.",

Examples: HIV-1 which can bind to both CD4 and galactosyl ceramide and SFV which can bind to MHC class I and an unknown receptor. (B) Adsorption of virus particles to the target cell surface by binding of the VAP to `pre-receptor' molecules (green), followed by high affinity binding to a primary receptor molecule (blue). Examples: recruitment of HSV by heparan sulphate and subsequent transfer to the tumour necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor homologue, and recruitment of adenovirus by an unknown receptor and transfer to the vitronectin receptor. (C) High affinity binding of a VAP to a receptor (green) induces conformational changes leading to the exposure of binding sites for a co-receptor (blue). Examples: primate lentiviruses (HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV) which bind to CD4 and chemokine receptor co-receptors (NB: some tissue culture variants of HIV may be able to by-pass the CD4 binding step and interact directly with the chemokine receptor molecule (see Fig. 2; [62])",

            "text": "Fig. 2: Transition of VAP/fusion proteins to the fusogenic state after VAP binding. (A) Conformational changes in the VAP/fusion protein are triggered through interaction with the receptor. These changes induce fusion competent states of the fusion protein, as illustrated by the exposure of N-terminal fusion peptides (black). Examples: induction of avian leukaemia virus (ALV) fusion through binding to the LDLR-related protein. (B) Low pH-induced fusion: pH-dependent viruses (e.g., influenza virus, VSV and SFV) undergo receptor-mediated endocytosis after binding to cell surface receptors and fuse within intracellular organelles. These organelles are acidified by vacuolar H+ATPases. (C) Two step activation of a VAP/fusion protein. Interaction with a primary receptor exposes binding sites for a co-receptor. Upon binding of the co-receptor the VAP/fusion protein changes to the fusogenic state. Example: primate lentiviruses (HIV-1, -2 and SIV). (C\u2032) In contrast to (C), some HIV Env proteins [62]have a capacity to interact with the co-receptor (blue) alone without the requirement of the primary receptor. Binding to the primary receptor can still occur but is not obligatory.",

            "text": "Fig. 3: Comparison of the VAP/fusion proteins of HIV and influenza virus. The precursors of the HIV Env protein (top panel) and the influenza virus haemagglutonin (HA) (bottom panel) are aligned schematically to illustrate some hypothetical structure\u2013functional similarities. The two precursor polypeptide chains are represented from their N-termini to the left to their C-termini to the right. The HIV Env encompasses approximately 860 residues and influenza HA 560. The C-termini of both molecules are cytoplasmic, or intravirional, but the cytoplasmic domain of HIV Env is considerably longer than that of HA (as represented by the segments to the right of the trans-membrane domains). During transport to the cell surface both precursors are cleaved as a prerequisite for subsequent fusion activity. The two resulting polypeptide chains of HIV Env, SU/gp120 (surface) and TM/gp41 (transmembrane), are non-covalently associated. Those of influenza virus, HA1 and HA2, are linked by a disulphide bond (intrachain disulphide bonds are not marked). SU and HA1 are responsible for the binding of the respective viruses to cell surface receptors, CD4 and sialic acid. Both receptor-binding sites are created by the juxtaposition in space of conserved residues that are non-contiguous in the amino-acid sequence. In SU of HIV these residues are situated in conserved regions on both sides of the V3 loop. The V3 loop influences the interactions with the chemokine-receptor co-receptors. The cleavage of the precursors creates novel N-termini in the transmembrane proteins. These N-terminal peptides share similar hydrophobic sequences and have been implicated in membrane fusion. C-terminal to the fusion peptides are potential `coil regions', two in the HIV TM extracellular domain (approx. residues 550\u2013580 and 630\u2013660 in the precursor), and one region in HA2 (residues 40\u2013105). These regions have a propensity to form alpha helices and may form coiled-coils as a step in a series of events that activate the membrane-fusing capacities of the two proteins.",
