Influenza A viruses have been isolated from humans, horses, swine, mink, seals, and whales as well as from a great variety of different avian species. There are striking differences in the type of disease resulting from influenza virus infection in the different species. Although there are variations in the severity of illness, in mammals infection is usually local and confined to the respiratory tract. The ferret has provided a suitable model to study this type of infection (Smith and Sweet, 1984) . The majority of the avian influenza viruses also cause local infection in the respiratory tract or in the gut, which frequently remains asymptomatic. In contrast, other avian strains are highly pathogenic, inducing systemic infection that regularly leads to the death of the animal. This type of disease is designated fowl plague. The avian system is particularly useful for pathogenicity studies because a large number of naturally occurring virus strains can be analyzed in their natural host.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 618, "end": 641, "text": "(Smith and Sweet, 1984)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "I.

It has long been known that it is responsible for the attachment of the virus to neuraminic acid-containing receptors at the cell surface. The receptor binding site is located in the globular region of the hemagglutinin spike. More recently it has become apparent that hemagglutinin is also involved in penetration by triggering fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. The first indication that hemagglutinin possesses a function in addition to adsorption came from the observation that cleavage of the precursor HA, while irrelevant for adsorption, is necessary for infectivity (Klenk et al., 1975; Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975) . Evidence has since been obtained that cleavage is necessary for the fusion capacity (Nicolau et al., 1978; Kurrle et al., 1979; Huang et al., 1980a) . The amino terminus of HA2 that is created in the cleavage reaction has attracted special attention as the crucial site for this activity. It is hydrophobic, highly conserved among the hemagglutinin subtypes, and shows structural similarity with the amino terminus of another fusion factor, the F1 polypeptide of paramyxoviruses (Gething et al., 1978; Scheid et al., 1978) . Furthermore, there is evidence that, in addition to hydrophobicity, a specific amino acid sequence in this region is also required for fusion (Richard-son et al., 1980; Garten et al., 1981) . The fusion capacity of hemagglutinin is expressed only at low pH (Maeda and Ohnishi, 1980; Huang et al., 1981a; White et al., 19811, and it has been shown that under these conditions the molecule undergoes a conformational change . It is reasonable to assume that the amino terminus of HA2 is exposed in such a way that it can insert into the target membrane, thereby forming a bridge between the two membranes. Alternatively, exposure of the hydrophobic amino termini of HA2 may result in an aggregation of hemagglutinin in the plane of the membrane and in the concomitant formation of areas of the viral envelope devoid of protein. Both mechanisms could result in the close apposition of the lipid layers of the cellular and viral membranes and thus facilitate their fusion. The dependency on low pH has led to the concept that the fusion of the influenza virus envelope takes place in endosomes (White et al., 1981) .

Since the NP protein interacts in the nucleocapsid not only with itself and the RNA but also with the three P proteins, it is reasonable to assume that it is part of the transcriptive and replicative complex. However, it is not clear whether it has a catalytic or only a structural function in this complex. NP is a phosphoprotein (Privalsky and Penhoet, 1977) . The phosphorylation pattern varies depending on the host and on the virus strain. Although the role of the phosphate groups is not clear, it has been speculated that these variations may account for differences in host range and pathogenicity . NP is the type-specific antigen by which influenza A, B, and C viruses can be distinguished from one another. However, minor differences in antigenicity have also been observed among the NP proteins of different influenza A viruses (Davenport et al., 1960; Schild et al., 1979) . The nucleocapsid protein also appears to play a major role in cell-mediated immunity, since it has been shown that the NP gene controls the induction of both subtype-specific and cross-reactive T cells (Towsend and Skehel, 1984; Fleischer et al., 1985) .

Comparative sequence analyses have revealed that the difference in receptor specificity is due in large part to a point mutation at the receptor binding site involving the exchange of the glutamine residue 226 in the avian viruses for leucine in the human strains (Rogers and Paulson, 1983; Rogers et al., 1983a,b) . It is therefore reasonable to assume that generation of the Hong Kong virus involved selection of a receptor-binding variant that allowed propagation in the human tissue.

Cleavability of the hemagglutinin of the adapted virus in the new cell type was attributed to a single amino acid substitution close to the cleavage site. The adapted virus still contained a single arginine at the cleavage site, and the mutation did not result in a general increase in the susceptibility of the hemagglutinin to activating proteases.

Preliminary studies with a nonpathogenic avian influenza virus (A/turkey/Oregon/71, H7N3) have shown that, following adaptation to chicken fibroblasts, variants could be obtained, the hemagglutinin of which became activated in a broad range of different cell types, similar to the pathogenic avian viruses.

Similar results were obtained among reassortants for A/turkey/Ontario/7732/66 (H5N9) and WSN virus.

Thus, the role of neuraminidase for HA cleavage, and therefore the initiation of viral replication leading to pathogenic effects, may be restricted to an interaction between a specific HA-NA combination.

It is, however, possible, as suggested by Schulman (1983) that \"different neuraminidases may differently activate or inactivate the required host proteases.\" In this context it should be remembered that different proteases differ from each other in their capacity to cleave and activate the HA of different virus strains (Tashiro et al., 198713) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 697, "end": 725, "text": "(Nakajima and Sugiura, 1980)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 768, "end": 792, "text": "(Sugiura and Ueda, 1980)", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1078, "text": "(Rott et al., 1983a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1099, "text": "unpublished results)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1449, "end": 1464, "text": "Schulman (1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 1728, "end": 1752, "text": "(Tashiro et al., 198713)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "B .

Because of their segmented genome and because of the large variety of different strains available, influenza viruses provide a suitable system to prove this concept. The numerous studies employing virus mutants and reassortants have indicated that pathogenicity depends on the functional integrity of each gene and on a gene constellation optimal for the infection of a given host. As a consequence, virtually every gene product of influenza virus has been reported to contribute to pathogenicity, but evidence is steadily growing that a key role has to be assigned to hemagglutinin.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "VIII. CONCLUDING REMARKS"}, {"text": "As the initiator of infection, hemagglutinin has a double function: first, promotion of adsorption of the virus to the cell surface, and then penetration of the viral genome through a fusion process between viral and cellular membranes. Adsorption is based on the binding to neuraminic acid-containing receptors, and different virus strains display a distinct preference for specific oligosaccharides. Fusion capacity depends on proteolytic cleavage by host proteases, and variations in amino acid sequence at the cleavage site determine whether hemagglutinin is activated in a given cell. Differences in cleavability and presumably also in receptor specificity are important determinants for host tropism, spread of infection, and pathogenicity. The concept that proteolytic activation is a determinant for pathogenicity was originally derived from studies on avian influenza viruses, but there is now evidence that it may also be relevant for the disease in humans, since bacterial proteases have been found to promote the development of influenza pneumonia in mammals. Moreover, proteolytic activation has been reported for a whole series of other viral surface proteins, and it appears that it may be quite a common determinant of virus pathogenicity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "VIII.
