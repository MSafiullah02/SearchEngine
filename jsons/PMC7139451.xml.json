Such a small peasant economy is generally organized by the household, \u201cwith the husband tilling the fields and the wife weaving,\u201d assisted by the elderly and the young. Every family member depends on each other, each carrying out their own duties. When it comes to time for harvesting or seeding, a time when labor force is needed the most, every member will do their utmost to contribute their share. The objective of domestic economic activity is usually to \u201cget a mere subsistence out of the soil\u201d rather than the pursuit of profit. As He Bingdi once said, the most prominent feature of China\u2019s agriculture is \u201cautarky.\u201d1 The surplus produced in the small peasant economy was extremely small with the small scale of the economy and the pressure from increasing population. It was vividly termed as the \u201csubsistence economy.\u201d",

From the perspective of Weber\u2019s \u201cpolitical finance,\u201d the peasants in the traditional society had to complete two tasks assigned by the state: taxes and corvee. As larger surplus could not be obtained from the small peasant economy, forced labor became an important way for the state to exploit the peasants. In addition, the small peasant economy shaped the governance model and structure of the traditional country: It was difficult for such a small surplus to support a complex state apparatus, thus impeding the expansion of state power, forming the political philosophy of \u201cno rule is the best rule\u201d2 and a governance tradition of \u201cthe emperor\u2019s reign stops at the county level,\u201d in addition to a dual governance pattern.

In order to maintain a basic level of agricultural growth and the number of agricultural labor force during this process, the state strived to improve conditions and technology for agricultural production. On the other hand, peasants were confined to the rural areas by the household registration system (hukou) and other special means to prevent them from swarming into the cities and intensifying pressure on the cities.

In addition, the financial resources were extremely unreasonably distributed between the urban and the rural. The government\u2019s rural health budget expenditure from 1991 to 2000 was merely 69 billion yuan, accounting for only 15.9 % of total government health budget expenditure. Although there was an increase of 50.67 billion yuan in government health expenditure, only 6.008 billion yuan or 12.4 % of the increased sum was spent on rural areas during this period.3 In the WTO assessment of the performance of national health systems of 191 WTO member countries in June 2000, it was found out that China ranked 188 (before Brazil, Myanmar, and Sierra Leone in the ranking) in terms of the \u201cfairness of financial burden.\u201d On the other hand, as rural health care investment is largely financed locally (the local government is responsible for the finance of the cities, counties, or villages, respectively, under its jurisdiction) since the introduction of the tax sharing system in 1994, there necessarily arose the divergence of health care investment among different places in terms of local health investment. Only 2 % of the local health expenditure is backed by the Central Government, whereas 55\u201360 % is financed by the county governments or township governments. But the local sanitation investment fully rely on the local economic development and fiscal revenue, while they differ greatly from place to place (taking 1998, for example, gross product of Shanghai was 368.82 billion yuan, while in Ningxia the figure of 22.75 billion yuan was less than 10 % of that of Shanghai). What rural public health service can exploit from the local financial resources is limited where the local fiscal revenue is limited. In some cases, the salaries of the health workers cannot be paid in such areas. If they were to survive under such circumstances, the health institutions would have no other choice than to resort to business income or income from selling drugs. As it was put by some people, we \u201csell drugs to support medicine,\u201d to \u201cprovide medical service with charge to support the health care center.\u201d According to a survey, 67 % of the county health funds come from business income, among which 51.2 % of the revenue comes from the outpatient department, 38 % from in-hospitalization, and 3.4 % from charged maternity and child-care service (Table17.1).\n",

They should not hesitate and consider their own luck and protect their own life first. Instead, they should regard others\u2019 pain as their own pain, have deep sympathy, and not delay. Saving the patient should take priority even when it is at the dangerous moment, in the small hours, or when the physicians are hungry or thirsty. Great physicians should be saviors of the common folks; bad physicians are the thief of the common folks.\u201d If a physician practices medicine only to \u201ccourt reputation\u201d and to \u201caccumulate wealth,\u201d then \u201cit is not a benevolent behavior,\u201d and \u201cit is disdained by humans and gods and those good people won\u2019t do it.\u201d",

So the total expense on mild and critically ill SARS patients was 23,000 and 67,000 yuan, respectively. What should we make of the figures? As Premier Wen Jiabao revealed to the reporters of Hong Kong Phoenix TV at the Press Conference after the Tenth National People\u2019s Congress in March 2003, \u201cIn China, 900 million of the 1.3 billion people are peasants. Among them, 30 million peasants have not been upgraded above the poverty line according to the standard of 625 yuan annual per capita income.\u201d \u201cIf the standard of 825 yuan is used, then the number of the peasants below the poverty line is 90 million.\u201d Using Wen\u2019s statistics, and assuming that these poor peasants must finance their own medical treatments, we will discover that, if the patient were a critically ill SARS patient, even if he has been working from 18 to 68 years old and does not spend a penny on anything, he would still be 27,000 short: 67,000 yuan \u2212 (800 yuan \u00d7 50 years) = 27,000 yuan. That is to say, if a peasant became a critically ill SARS patient, he would have to work until he was 103 years old to pay off his medical fees. As a matter of fact, 170,000 yuan (excluding human capital) was spent on the case of imported SARS in Jiangxi Province. No wonder peasants were severely frightened and resorted to fleeing the area when SARS struck (Xu Yong 2003). Fortunately, the state exerted all its powers under the guideline that \u201cnothing should be left undone to control the epidemic.\u201d Faced with the epidemic of SARS, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Health Gao Qiang announced on April 20, 2003 that \u201cmedical fee subsidy system should be implemented for the urban SARS patients in economic difficulties and all the peasant patients.\u201d Three days later, two billion yuan was allocated by the Central Government for the founding of a SARS Prevention Fund. On April 29, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Health issued a document, in which it was prescribed that free treatment be provided for those urban SARS patients in economic difficulties and peasant patients, and all the costs be reimbursed by the government. On May 1, the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance, Labor and Social Security Ministry, and Ministry of Civil Affairs jointly issued \u201cNotice about the Medical Expenses of Atypical Pneumonia Patients and Suspected SARS Patients,\u201d emphasizing the principle of \u201ctreatment first, fees later.\u201d All patients with fever will receive treatment and be hospitalized with neither registration fee nor deposit (prepayment); all the peasants and the poor people in the cities belonged to this category. Only with such state arrangement was the escape of the frantic peasants prevented and conditions conducive to the triumph over the spreading of SARS were created.",
