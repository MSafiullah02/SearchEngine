Additionally, the intracellular exposures of the active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite GS-443902 observed in rhesus monkey PBMCs were in the range of those observed in human PBMCs. Based on the dose-proportional pharmacokinetics observed in both species, drug exposure from the loading dose of 10 mg/kg in rhesus monkeys is similar to the expected drug exposure from the loading dose of 200 mg in humans. Toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys and rats and safety and pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers support the safety of the proposed dose. Overall, RDV has a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile that supports evaluation of a 200 mg loading and a 100 mg daily dose that has potential to be efficacious in adult patients infected with coronavirus.Transient treatment-emergent elevations in ALT and AST (Grade \u2264 2), have been observed after multiple daily RDV administration in Studies GS-US-399-1954 and GS-US-399-5505. To date in human studies, no SAEs have occurred in healthy individuals who have received at least 1 dose of RDV. Remdesivir has been tested in healthy volunteers as a single ascending dose over a dose range of 3 to 225 mg and in a multi-dose study of 150mg for up to 14 days and at 200 mg loading dose followed by 100mg for a total of 10 days. The potential changes in transaminases in CoV-infected patients treated with RDV can be readily monitored by standard clinical chemistry laboratory tests.",
