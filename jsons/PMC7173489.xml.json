Despite this deceptive simplicity, virus infections are less well understood than bacterial diseases, largely because viruses cannot be grown alone in culture but depend on a host cell. Until recently, protection against virus diseases relied on public health measures and vaccination. Only since the late 1980s have a significant number of specific antiviral agents become available.",

In contrast, because viruses rely on the host cell for almost all of their metabolic reactions, they usually have few unique components apart from the structural proteins of the virus particle. Consequently, most chemical agents that prevent virus metabolism are also toxic to the host cells. Another problem is that viruses mutate rapidly and so develop resistance to antiviral agents relatively quickly. This is especially serious for RNA viruses, such as influenza or HIV, which have extremely high mutation rates.",

After entry, viral replication occurs at the expense of the host cell, which supplies not only raw material and energy, but also the ribosomes needed for synthesis of viral proteins and often many of the enzymes required for synthesis of viral nucleic acids as well. Finally, new virus particles are assembled and exit the cell. These stages, and some corresponding antiviral agents are shown in Figure 21.1\nand listed in Table 21.1\n. Antiviral agents that combat HIV are discussed in the later section on AIDS.

These pieces are each packed into an inner nucleocapsid and are surrounded by an outer envelope (Fig. 21.5\n). Although the outer membrane is derived from host-cell material, it contains virus-encoded proteins such as neuraminidase, hemagglutinin, and ion channels. These viral proteins are made on the ribosomes of the infected host cell and are involved in virus recognition and entry into successive host cells. The hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) of influenza differ slightly but significantly between strains of flu. These variants are designated by H and N numbers. Thus, the Spanish flu of 1918 was H1N1, and the avian flu presently spreading worldwide is H5N1. The virulent outbreak of novel avian flu in China in 2013 was H7N9. This virus contains segments from several different avian flu strains. Genome analysis confirms increased virulence and implies resistance to amantadine (see following discussion).",

The CCR5\u039432 allele has a deletion of 32 base pairs and results in nonfunctional CCR5 protein. Individuals homozygous for CCR5\u039432 are vastly less susceptible to infection by HIV (although not totally resistant). In addition, if these individuals are infected, the disease progresses much more slowly. About 2% of Europeans are homozygous for CCR5\u039432 and 14% are heterozygous. Heterozygotes are mildly protected and show slower progression, in accord with the lower levels of CCR5 protein on the surfaces of their T cells. The origin of the CCR5\u039432 allele has been traced back to around 700 years ago in northwest Europe, at about the time of the Black Death. Conceivably, the defects in CCR5 were selected by providing resistance against the bubonic plague. Variations in susceptibility to AIDS also result from alterations in the DNA sequence of the promoter for the CCR5 gene. Presumably, these alterations cause variations in the level of CCR5 protein expressed.",

HIV mutates at a rate of approximately one base per genome per cycle of replication. Even within a single patient, HIV exists as a swarm of closely related variants known as a quasi-species. Consequently, strains of HIV resistant to individual drugs appear at a relatively high frequency. Attempts to control AIDS (Fig. 21.11\n; Table 21.2\n), whether by using vaccines, protein processing inhibitors, or antisense RNA, all face the same problem: HIV will mutate to produce resistant variants.

AZT and other 3\u2032-deoxy base analogs are converted to the 5\u2032-triphosphate by the cell and then incorporated into the growing DNA chain during reverse transcription (Fig. 21.12\n). Because AZT lacks a 3\u2032-hydroxyl group, the DNA chain cannot be extended. AZT is thus a DNA chain terminator. Although AZT is incorporated more readily by the viral reverse transcriptase than by most host-cell DNA polymerases, it is not completely specific. Thus, one major drawback is that AZT partially inhibits host DNA synthesis in uninfected cells of the body. In particular, it is toxic to bone marrow cells (B cells), which are another part of the immune system. Mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase may cause resistance to base analogs. For example, Met41Leu (i.e., replacement of methionine at position 41 with leucine) increases resistance to AZT by 4-fold, and a second mutation of Thr215Tyr gives an overall 70-fold resistance.",

The prion protein is attracted into the nanopore by a transmembrane voltage that attracts the positively charged N-terminus of the prion protein.
