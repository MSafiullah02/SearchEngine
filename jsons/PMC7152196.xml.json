Serum levels of teriflunomide are referred to as leflunomide levels. The half-life of teriflunomide is long in humans (approximately 15 days). The drug enters the enterohepatic recirculation and is excreted by the intestinal and urinary systems in equal proportions. Leflunomide is insoluble in water and is suspended in 1% carboxymethylcellulose for oral administration.\n",

Studies have indicated that, in addition to inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, leflunomide and the MNAs may act through inhibition of tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor of human fibroblasts has been shown to be inhibited by leflunomide.6 It was shown that leflunomide directly inhibited the interleukin (IL)-2-stimulated protein tyrosine kinase activity of p56lck and p59fyn,6 which is associated with activation through the T cell receptor/CD3 complex. At higher concentrations, A771726 also inhibited IL-2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK3 protein tyrosine kinases.7 Leflunomide analogs have also been shown to possess strong inhibitory activity on the antiapoptotic tyrosine kinase Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase, a key factor for T cell-independent antibody formation.8 The hypothesis that leflunomide may exhibit more than one mechanism of action in vivo was further illustrated in mice where uridine restored proliferation and IgM production by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cells, whereas suppression of IgG production was not reversed. This phenomenon correlated in a dose-dependent manner with tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 and STAT6 proteins, known to be involved in IL-4-induced signal transduction pathways.4 This double in vivo mechanism of action was confirmed in rats, in which xenoreactivity was counteracted by the administration of uridine, whereas alloreactivity was not.9\n",

In a prospective study, 26 renal transplant recipients with biopsy-proven BKVN were treated with leflunomide in combination with discontinuation of MMF and reduction of tacrolimus to a 4 to 6 ng/mL range.38 Although the leflunomide levels were in the lower range (on average 50 mg/mL), a significant reduction in serum and urine BK virus (BKV) titers was obtained, allograft function stabilized, and the overall graft loss rates because of BKV were only 15%.35 Less encouraging results were obtained in another prospective open-label study in which viral clearance was only obtained in 40% of patients with significant toxicity, resulting in discontinuation of the drug in 17% of patients.39 The contribution of reduction of immunosuppressive agents and leflunomide to the efficacy of BKVN treatment is unclear at this moment.40, 41, 42 Based on recent in vitro data, it has been suggested that the combination of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition with leflunomide might be an effective treatment approach.43 Treatment with leflunomide in kidney transplant recipients with BK viremia was able to prevent the development of BKVN.44 A study from Jaw et al. reported on three kidney transplant recipients with BKVN who were treated with a combination of leflunomide and everolimus; all patients experienced significant reductions in viral loads (one with complete resolution) and two patients had preserved allograft function at the end of follow-up.45 In case reports, patients with resistant/refractory CMV infections,46, 47, 48, 49, 50 extensive cutaneous warts,51 and a patient with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma52 have been successfully treated with leflunomide. FK778 has also been studied in the context of BKVN, but although it was able to decrease BK viral load, FK778 treatment was associated with more acute rejections, decreased renal function, and more adverse events compared with reduction of immunosuppression.53\n",

            "text": "FTY720 has a unique mechanism of action as it mainly affects lymphocyte trafficking.30, 65, 66, 67 FTY720 acts as a high-affinity agonist of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1 or Edg1). Binding of its receptor results in internalization of S1PR1, rendering lymphocytes unable to respond to the naturally occurring gradient of S1P (low concentrations in thymus and secondary lymphoid organs, high concentrations in lymph and plasma) retaining lymphocytes in the low-S1P environment of lymphoid organs.67, 68 After FTY720 administration in mice, B and T cells immediately leave the peripheral blood and migrate to the peripheral lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, and Peyer\u2019s patches. The cells return to the peripheral blood after withdrawal of the drug without undergoing apoptotic death.69 This altered cell trafficking is accompanied by a reduction of lymphocyte infiltration into grafted organs.69, 70, 71 Interestingly, lymphocytes treated ex vivo with FTY720 and reintroduced in vivo similarly migrate to the peripheral lymphoid tissues, indicating that FTY720 acts directly on lymphocytes. This process of accelerated homing was completely blocked in vivo by coadministration of anti-CD62L, anti-CD49d, and anti-CD11a monoclonal antibody.30 In vitro, FTY720 in the presence of TNF-\u03b1 increases the expression of certain intercellular adhesion molecules on human endothelial cells.72 Thus alteration of cell trafficking by FTY720 may result not only from its direct action on lymphocytes, but also from an effect on endothelial cells.",

Tofacitinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and to a much lesser extent by CYP2C19, and its metabolites are largely inactive. Due to its metabolism through the CYPA4 pathway, drug interactions in solid-organ transplant recipients can be expected and dose adjustments are necessary in the presence of azole antifungals and rifamycins.

As the expression of the receptors is restricted to immune cells, this makes them an attractive target for new immunosuppressants. Signal transduction mediated by JAK3 is obligatory for lymphocyte activation, differentiation, and homeostasis, as evidenced by the finding that deficiency in JAK3 results in severe combined deficiency syndrome.132, 133, 134, 135 A possible detrimental effect of interference with IL-2 signaling relates to the fact that tolerance induction is essentially dependent on the IL-2 pathway.136, 137, 138 Thus the challenge for immunosuppressive drug design has been to achieve selective inhibition of JAK3 versus JAK2 activities. Tofacitinib was initially claimed to be a selective JAK3 inhibitor that was found to have 20- to 100-fold less activity to both JAK1 and JAK2 based on inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) values; however, numerous other laboratories published inconsistent IC50 results at the various JAK domains. Tofacitinib inhibits JAK1 and JAK2 to a greater degree than was initially thought and also inhibits Tyk2 marginally.139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144\n",

Patients in group 1 received tacrolimus, and patients in groups 2 and 3 were administered tofacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg twice per day, respectively.151 Because of the high incidence of BKVN in the tofacitinib groups, the protocol was adjusted to stop MMF and decrease the steroid exposure. Compared with tacrolimus, both tofacitinib groups showed similar rates of acute rejection episodes and allograft function, but experienced greater incidences of hyperlipidemia and infections (suggestive of additional JAK2 inhibition).151 A phase IIB trial compared cyclosporine at standard dosage versus tofacitinib 15 mg twice per day for 6 months then 10 mg twice per day, or tofacitinib 15 mg twice per day for 3 months then 10 mg twice per day. In addition, all patients received induction therapy, MMF, and steroids. Unexpectedly, the lower tofacitinib dosage arm showed a trend toward the lowest rejection rate and a superior allograft function. However, in this study there were important adverse events, including serious infections and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease in both tofacitinib arms.152 In a post hoc analysis of this study patients were reclassified based on median tofacitinib exposure (2 h postdose concentration more [above-median exposure] or less [below-median exposure] than 122 mg/mL).153 The incidences of biopsy-proven acute rejection were noninferior compared with the cyclosporine A group. However, serious infections and CMV disease were only significantly increased in the above-median exposure group, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) cases only occurred in the above-median exposure group.153 Serious adverse events due to leukopenia and neutropenia remained significant in both the tofacitinib groups compared with the cyclosporine group.153\n",

Tofacitinib 15 mg twice per day coadministered with MMF resulted in similar outcomes while associated with modest lipid elevations and a higher rate of viral infections. In our opinion, considering the known side effect profile of CNI, further evaluation of tofacitinib is warranted. Given the side effects reported with the use of tofacitinib, the challenge remains to develop immunosuppressive drugs with truly selective inhibition of JAK3 versus JAK2 activities. The lack of success in developing a selective antagonist of JAK3 probably relates to the focus on chemical analogs of ATP whereas more success is to be expected from developing molecules displaying allosteric inhibition via binding of noncatalytic sites. Time-weighted 2 h postdose concentration therapeutic drug monitoring in tofacitinib-treated group is potentially interesting to relaunch tofacitinib as an immunosuppressive drug for kidney transplant recipients, especially in patients with refractory acute rejection where blockade of IL-15 and IL-7 can prevent the immunologic skewing toward memory cells.155, 156\n",

As marginal zone B cells are resistant to bortezomib-mediated effects, T-independent type 2 responses are less affected.174 In a mouse model of lupus, bortezomib depleted both short- and long-lived plasma cells, resulting in a reduction of antidouble-stranded DNA antibody production.175 Vogelbacher et al. recently established that bortezomib alone or in combination with sirolimus can also prevent alloantibody formation in a rat model of kidney transplantation.176\n",

Moreover, in a report from the Mayo Clinic only a modest reduction in HLA antibody titers and no effect on cPRA or flow crossmatch was observed.183 A recent report in nonhuman primates undergoing fully mismatched allogeneic skin transplant reported that bortezomib treatment was followed by a rebound effect characterized by increased circulating IgG+ B cells, increased germinal center B cells, and follicular helper T cells in the lymph nodes.184 This reaction was termed humoral compensation by the authors and shown to be driven by B cell activating factor of TNF family (BAFF).184 These data suggest that future trials should combine bortezomib with agents inhibiting BAFF signaling such as belimumab and atacicept. Newer proteasome inhibitors such as carfilzomib result in irreversible inhibition whereas bortezomib only induces temporal inhibition of the proteasome.185 Studies are ongoing evaluating carfilzomib in desensitization protocol in patients with preformed HLA antibodies (NCT02442648) and in the treatment of acute humoral rejection in lung transplantation (NCT02474927).",

Its analog 15-deoxyspergualin subsequently became widely known as a promising new immunosuppressant. The precise mode of action of 15-deoxyspergualin is largely unknown and, because of its poor oral bioavailability, 15-deoxyspergualin must be delivered parenterally, which hampers its widespread clinical use.238 Its efficacy has been demonstrated in the treatment of kidney allograft rejection, ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation, and transplantation in sensitized patients.239, 240, 241 Until analogs are developed that allow oral administration,242 the major clinical indication of 15-deoxyspergualin is limited to the treatment of rejection crises where 15-deoxyspergualin may be an interesting alternative to steroids or antilymphocyte agents. The fact that it remains effective after recurrent administration is promising.",

The group of Strober-identified post-TLI suppressor cells as host-type NK T cells, as the protective effect of TLI against graft-versus-host disease was abrogated in mice with a CD1d-inactivated gene.248 These host-type NK T cells produced IL-4 and stimulated donor-type cells to produce IL-4 also.248, 249 Definitive evidence of the functional importance and activity of these suppressor cells was delivered by the demonstration that they could prevent graft-versus-host disease in vivo.250 Post-TLI attenuation of effector T-lymphocyte reactivity was equally proposed to be responsible for the observed immunosuppressed state after TLI.251, 252, 253 This intrinsic T cell defect was dependent on the irradiation of both thymus and extrathymic tissues.254 After TLI, anergized T cells were shown to be incapable of proliferating even in the presence of exogenous IL-2.255 In other studies, TLI was shown to lead to thymic clonal deletion of donor- or host-reactive lymphocytes.256 TLI-treated mice also exhibited decreased antidonor cytotoxic T cell precursor frequencies.257 Finally, Strober\u2019s group showed that Th2 lymphocytes recover soon after TLI, whereas Th1 lymphocytes remain deficient for several months,10 and showed that this defect can also be prevented by thymic shielding during irradiation.251 This Th2 dominance after TLI has been confirmed by other groups in rodents258 and in large animals.259 Recently, Nador et al. demonstrated that tolerance induction after conditioning with TLI and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) depends on the ability of naturally occurring regulatory NK T cells and regulatory T cells to suppress the residual alloreactive T cells that are capable of rejecting the allograft.260\n",

After 6 months of follow-up, photopheresis-treated patients developed significantly fewer multiple rejections, and there were no significant differences in the rates or types of infection. Although there was no significant effect on graft survival rates at 6 or 12 months, this study indicated that photopheresis may be an effective new immunosuppressive regimen in transplant recipients.310 In patients with refractory bronchiolitis obliterans after lung transplantation, photopheresis resulted in a stabilization of graft function and/or in some of these patients in histologic reversal of rejection.311, 312\n",

Alexandre et al. reported a series of 38 such ABO-incompatible living donor transplants in which the recipient was prepared by plasmapheresis, donor-specific platelet transfusion, and splenectomy.322, 323, 324 Although the authors believe that the need for plasmapheresis and donor-specific platelet transfusion should be reevaluated, splenectomy was thought to be important, because 3 of 38 recipients who did not have a splenectomy lost their grafts from acute vascular rejection, in contrast to only 5 of 33 who did undergo splenectomy. A small-scale but successful experience with postsplenectomy ABO-incompatible living donor kidney transplantation has also been reported by Ishikawa et al. in Japan.325 In the setting of ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation, antigen-specific immunoadsorption, rituximab, and bortezomib treatment have been developed as alternatives to plasmapheresis and splenectomy. This will further reduce the indications for splenectomy in organ transplantation.326, 327\nSplenectomy has also been applied in combination with eculizumab as salvage therapy in patients developing severe antibody-mediated rejection after HLA-incompatible kidney transplantation.328 In a follow-up report, splenectomy was substituted for splenic irradiation.329\n",

Different combinations of plasmapheresis with rituximab, corticosteroids, IV IG, and bortezomib have been reported.334 Plasmapheresis should be performed until crossmatch testing becomes negative typically on a daily basis or on alternate days, and the number of plasmapheresis sessions is dependent on the antibody levels and degree of mismatch. Transplantation should be performed within days of the last desensitization before rebound of anti-HLA antibody titers occurs. Encouraging early results of this approach have been reported, although they were associated with considerable morbidity.335, 336, 337 Recent studies provided evidence of an important survival benefit for patients undergoing HLA-incompatible kidney transplantation after desensitization.330, 331 In an analysis by Segev and colleagues, 1025 HLA-sensitized patients from 22 centers undergoing desensitization before kidney transplant from a living donor between 1997 and 2011 were included. Different desensitization protocols were applied in this study. Compared with patients on the waiting list or receiving a deceased donor transplant or patients on the waiting list not receiving a transplant, the 8-year survival rates of HLA-sensitized recipients was 13.6 and 32.6 percentage points higher, respectively. Also the risk of death was significantly reduced after transplantation from an incompatible live donor after desensitization treatment. The most important adverse events associated with desensitization were anaphylaxis, hypotension, and infections.331\n",

Although some initial reports suggested a beneficial effect,342 controlled trials were unconvincing. Nojima et al. reported the successful treatment of antibody-mediated acute renal allograft rejection by combining plasmapheresis with 15-deoxyspergualin.343 Antibody-mediated rejection is increasingly being recognized as a determinant of short-term and long-term allograft outcome.344 The optimal treatment of antibody-mediated rejection is undetermined at this moment, and possible therapeutic approaches include combinations of plasmapheresis exchange, IV IG, and anti-CD20 antibody to remove donor-specific antibodies and inhibit antibody production. However, evidence on safety and efficacy is weak, and the optimal treatment protocol has yet to be determined.345\n",
