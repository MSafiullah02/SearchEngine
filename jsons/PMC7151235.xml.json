These results are consistent with that of a previous study9 that examined patient visits at the Prince Philip Dental Hospital in Hong Kong 10 working days after the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, during which visits dropped to less than one fifth. The percentage of endodontic emergency patients has increased from 13.47% in 2019 and 17.96% in 2018 to 50.26% during the COVID-19 outbreak in the study. This observed increase could be accounted for by the closing of other facilities that were available to treat endodontic patients under normal operations and possibly by the reduction of trauma as an indirect result of the lockdown. The reduction of outdoor activities by the lockdown may consequently result in a decrease in trauma occurrences, which was reportedly the chief complaint among patients who visited the dental emergency room of a dental hospital in Korea10. These results highlight patient needs for endodontic treatment even under public health emergencies.",

However, this discrepancy may be caused by the higher proportion of endodontic emergency patients in our patient population. The largest age group for endodontic emergencies was 45\u201364 years (30.21%, 29/96) in our study. Importantly, older age and the existence of underlying comorbidities are associated with a poorer COVID-19 prognosis4\n,\n16\n,\n17. Because patients older than 65 years represented approximately 15% of all patients, care should be exercised to avoid cross contamination.",

            "text": "Patient screening was crucial during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2002 and 200318. An important tool in patient screening is the use of disease-specific questionnaires, which can differ depending on the location at which they are used (eg, epicenter vs other sites). In this study, 4 patients with a previous COVID-19 history or possible COVID-19 cases were identified using the questionnaire. A fever was reported to be the most common clinical symptom (98%) for 41 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in a previous study19. No patient with a fever presented to WHUSS for endodontic emergencies. Conversely, a patient with pyogenic osteomyelitis of the jaw was found to have a fever (>37.2\u00b0C) but tested negative for COVID-19 by a series of diagnostic tests. Notably, several infections of the oral cavity could present with a fever that could confound the diagnosis of COVID-19; thus, a fever alone should not be the only sign and symptom of COVID-19 to be evaluated, and oral disease needs to be accurately diagnosed. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently based on a combination of epidemiologic information, clinical symptoms, chest computed tomographic imaging findings, and laboratory tests such as on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respiratory tract specimens4. Sabino-Silva et al20 have raised important questions about the role saliva plays in the human-to-human transmission of diseases, in particular respiratory coronaviruses21\n,\n22.",

            "text": "Symptomatic irreversible pulpitis was the most common endodontic emergency, with a significantly high VNRS score in our study. Treatments for endodontic emergency were challenging during the COVID-19 outbreak because inhalation of airborne particles and aerosols produced during dental procedures on patients with COVID-19 could potentially expose dentists to the virus20, thus making them high-risk procedures. Reducing treatment time and exposure control are 2 ways the risk of infection for endodontic treatment could be reduced. For vital pulp cases such as pulpitis, vital pulp therapy including pulpotomy or pulp capping might be helpful in terms of shortening the treatment time. Pulpotomy has been reported to reduce pain symptoms in nearly 90% of dental emergency patients 1 day after treatment24. Partial pulpotomy using mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) sustained a good success rate (85%) over 3-year follow-ups in mature permanent teeth clinically diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis25, and full pulpotomy using MTA showed a 92.7% success rate at a 3-year follow-up for caries-exposed pulps in mature permanent molar teeth26. Direct pulp capping with MTA showed a cumulative survival rate of 85% in adult molars with carious pulpal exposure at 36 months27. For cases that required root canal treatments, cone-beam computed tomographic imaging and single-file systems should be considered. Besides the advantages of detecting root canal location and configuration28, cone-beam computed tomographic examination could avoid nausea or vomiting for patients that may occur during intraoral x-ray examination and prevent exposure to patients\u2019 oral cavity4. During root canal preparation, single-file nickel-titanium systems could be used to save working time29 as well as prevent the risk of resterilization. For any treatment that produces droplets and/or aerosols, Ather et al30 suggested a number of preventative measures, such as the use of rubber dams. It has been reported that up to 70% of airborne particles could be reduced around a 3-ft diameter of the operational field when a rubber dam is used31. In addition, a rubber dam is not only able to limit the diffusion of the aerosol but is also likely to dramatically reduce or even eliminate the presence of salivary components in the aerosol.",
