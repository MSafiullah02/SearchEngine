            "text": "In modern days, ZnO semiconductors have received enormous attention due to their distinct and desirable applications in diverse areas of chemistry, physics, biology, medicine, electronics, etc. These characteristics may be endowed due to their large surface area, reduced size, availability of surface specific binding site, catalytic, electronic and thermal properties (Shoeb et al. 2013). ZnO-NPs are commercially available in the form of powders or dispersions, which are extensively used in calamine lotion, baby powders, ceramics, UV filters, ointments, paints, food additives, etc. (Kolodziejczak-Radzimska and Jesionowski 2014). ZnO-NPs have also been reported to possess potential human health benefits such as antimicrobial (Das et al. 2013), antioxidant (Premanathan et al. 2011), anticorrosive (Ansari et al. 2011) and anticancer activity (Li et al. 2010a, b). ZnO belongs to II\u2013VI semiconductor, since it is found in the second and sixth group of the periodic table, with a wide band gap energy of 3.3 eV. Such obvious multifunctional ZnO-NPs have been synthesized by various methods such as precipitation, hydrothermal, sol\u2013gel, electrodeposition and chemical methods (Ramimoghadam et al. 2013). These methods yield ZnO-NPs with diversified distinct morphology, size, shape with an ability to persuade various properties and applications (Yu et al 2005; Macmanus-driscoll 2017). Many of these methods are tedious, exorbitant and utilize toxic chemicals imposing environmental and biological risks. Hence, there is an increasing need for an alternative method of synthesis which is safe, eco-friendly and cost-effective. Green synthesis is an unconventional method of nanoparticle synthesis, which is an eco-friendly, risk-free, inexpensive, hypoallergic, single step synthesis method getting wide attention.",

DPPH is a stable free radical and a well-known trap (\"scavenger\") for other radicals. DPPH radical has deep purple color in solution due to the strong absorption band centered at about 520 nm, and it becomes colorless or pale yellow when neutralized by accepting an electron from the antioxidant molecule. This nature allows visual observation of the reaction, due to change in the optical absorption at 520 nm or in the EPR (electron spin resonance) signal of the DPPH. A concentration of 0.14 mM of DPPH was prepared by dissolving 39.4 mg of DPPH in 100 ml of methanol. Varying concentrations of nanoparticles (2\u201320 mg) were mixed with 50% methanol and 140 \u00b5l of 0.14 mM DPPH solution was added. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature (dark condition) and the absorbance was recorded at 520 nm using spectrophotometer (Evolution-220, ThermoScientific) against the blank solution (50% methanol). Ascorbic acid was used as a reference standard for measuring the scavenging activity. The actual absorbance was taken as the absorbance difference of the control and test sample; IC50 values were determined. The mixture without test sample was considered as control.",

(2012). The band gap (Eg) of bulk ZnO material (Eg = 3.45148 eV) was greater than the estimated bandgap of the synthesized ZnO-NPs because of the effective size of the nanoparticles. Sharp peaks in the absorption spectra imply that the particles are nanosized with narrow particle size distribution. The peak was shifted away from origin when compared to the bulk, indicating the red shift due to quantum size effects (Xu et al. 2004).",

Among the tested strains, E.coli was found to be more susceptible to S-ZnO-NPs with 28.64 mm zone of inhibition (p < 0.05) compared to standard and other samples. No inhibition of growth was observed in bulk ZnO, sterile dH2O and aqueous plant extracts against all the tested bacterial strains (Fig. 13). The highest mean zone of inhibition observed against P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and B. subtilis was found to be 20.31 mm (S-ZnO-NP), 21.51 mm (C-ZnO-NP) and 19.13 mm (S-ZnO-NP) respectively at p < 0.05. These results are in agreement with the findings of Mahendra et al. (2017), wherein the greater antibacterial efficiency was observed in green synthesized ZnO-NPs rather than the plant extracts of Cochlospermum religiosum (L.). Similarly, the antimicrobial activity of the Allophylus serratus leaf extract mediated silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) exhibited more activity than the Allophylus serratus callus extract mediated Ag-NPs (Jemal et al. 2017) which is in accordance with the present findings.",

There are certain synthetic drugs and food items which can prevent the disease to certain levels, yet complete treatment is impossible. Therefore, biofabricated ZnO-NPs could be a potent starch blocker drug to cure this dysfunction (Dhobale et al. 2008). The complex polysaccharides and disaccharides in the food are broken down into simple monosaccharides by the enzymes \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase. The elevated blood sugar level after food intake (postprandial hyperglycemia) could be reduced via inhibiting the activities of these two enzymes eventually reducing carbohydrate hydrolysis. Many of the synthetic drugs rely on this startegy of inhibition with certain side effects such as abdominal bloating and diarrhoea (Kitture et al. 2015; Ghosh et al. 2012). Looking at the above results of \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition assays, green synthesized ZnO-NPs could be effectively used as a potent antidiabetic drug which was found to be a stable and biocompatible form of zinc associated with insulin metabolism.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles could induce cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines, leading to various consequences such as oxidative stress-induced injury, inflammation associated with the release of proinflammatory mediators, fibrosis and so on. Upon the breakdown of metallic oxide nanoparticles, some of the toxic responses are induced in the cell, which is dangerous to the cell components themselves (Lewinski et al. 2008). Nanosized structures enter the biological system through intravenous, skin, subcutaneous, oral and intraperitoneal means. The entered nanoparticles are absorbed to interact with biological components of cells, such as nucleic acids and proteins, distributing various organs of the body where they will be modified, metabolized or remain structurally same to exhibit their toxicity (Rahban et al. 2010). Sun et al. (2012) proposed a different hypothesis for induced toxicity of nanoparticles, which is autophagy or cellular self-digestion. Many reports had focused attention on the nanoparticles which are novel activators of autophagy and induce autophagy cell death (Chen et al. 2005; Zabirnyk et al. 2007; Li et al. 2010a, b).",

As compared to other biological systems used in nanoparticle synthesis, plant and plant-derived products are gaining much interest, because the method is simple, quick and a straight single step process. Analogous to the present work, researchers such as Mude et al. (2009) and Satyavani et al. (2011) had put efforts in synthesizing nanoparticles from callus derived from plants such as Carica papaya and Citrullus colocynthis, respectively. Adopting callus cultures for the biosynthesis of nanoparticles is extremely a great concept for the reason that calluses are formed under sterile milieu and are suitable for biomedical applications. There is a need for further research to study the molecular mechanisms involved in these biological activities.",

This is the first report on the synthesis of ZnO-NPs from callus, leaf and stem extracts of M. frondosa. XRD study showed wurtzite structures of ZnO-NPs. The average crystallite size of synthesized semiconductor ZnO-NPs was found in the range of 5-25 nm. The UV\u2013Vis spectral analysis confirmed that the maximum absorption at 370\u2013376 nm range corresponds to the intrinsic band gap of ZnO-NPs. SEM images confirmed the spongy structure of agglomerated spherical-shaped nanoparticles. FTIR spectra revealed the absorption bands between 3350 and 1045 cm\u22121, confirming the stretching of functional groups involved in the bioreduction of ZnO-NPs. DLS analysis unveiled the monodispersity and stability of bioreduced nanoparticles. Carcinogenic methylene blue dye was efficiently disintegrated using ZnO-NPs under UV light. In addition, the present work also demonstrated a significant antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and anticancer activities of ZnO-NPs. In brief, this is a simple, effective, biosynthetic method which could be an alternative for chemical and physical methods for the large-scale production of ZnO-NPs. Applications of such eco-friendly ZnO-NPs in different fields such as medicine, catalysis and drug delivery systems make this bioreduction process a highly suitable way for large-scale synthesis.",
