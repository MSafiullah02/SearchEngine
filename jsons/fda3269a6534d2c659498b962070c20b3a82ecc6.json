Endonasal endoscopic pituitary adenoma resection was performed in a regular operating room on January 6th. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage occurred during the resection process, and the surgeon managed to fix the dural tears promptly. He had a transient fever of 37.8 \u2022 C within 20 h postoperation, which could be resolved by physical method of cooling, and he showed no cough or neurological symptoms in that period. Oral prednisone and levothyroxine were administered 2-and 4-d postoperation, respectively, when hormonal test revealed low prolactin, testosterone, free triiodothyronine (FT3), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; Table 1 ). Three days later, he had a fever of 38.5 \u2022 C, intravenous meropenem administration was initiated on January 10th accordingly for potential intracranial infection indicated by significant white blood cell count (WBC) elevation (Table 1) and CSF leakage during surgery. The doctors arranged a lumbar puncture soon but failed to collect sufficient CSF. The patient didn't show Kernig's or Brudzinski's sign but experienced fatigue and dry cough, therefore alternative examina- tions were scheduled to identify common pathogens, including influenza A and B, adenovirus, Chlamydophila, and Mycoplasma pneumonia, etc. On January 11th, common pathogen tests ( Table 2 ) came out negative but lung CT ( Figure 2B ) and blood test (Table 1) turned positive, the former indicated ground glass sign, pleura effusion, and consolidation; the latter showed decreasing lymphocyte count with slightly increasing WBC. After consulting with Department of Infectious Disease, oral antiviral therapy started. The patient was treated as 'pneumonia of unknown etiology' in a quarantine room. Special protocol was initiated and all personnel were requested to wear protective equipment when visiting him since then.",

Transmission from an asymptomatic patient was reported, 8 and higher viral loads were detected soon after symptom onset, with higher viral loads detected in the nose than in the throat. 9 The estimated half-life of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols was approximately 1.1 to 1.2 h, 10 but it does not necessarily mean the aerosols cannot be filtered by surgical masks or N95 respirators. Endonasal endoscopic surgery is performed in a narrow, longitu-dinal canal, assisted by suction and irrigation. The chance that aerosols and droplets originating in nostrils escape the suction and are inhaled subsequently by surgeons is rare. Therefore, we think it is not wise to cancel all the endonasal endoscopic surgeries especially the emergency ones, such as pituitary apoplexy, and COVID-19 is supposed to be containable when the surgeries are performed in negative pressure operating rooms with sufficient personal protective equipment and the patients are kept under quarantine postoperatively. While we do not encourage elective surgeries during this pandemic, which might impact patients' immune system and put them in conditions vulnerable to COVID-19.",
