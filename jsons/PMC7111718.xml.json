Whilst higher primates are susceptible to experimental infection, natural infection has only been detected in humans (Choo et al., 1994, Choo et al., 1989, Kuo et al., 1989, Saito et al., 1990). An estimated 3% of the world population is chronically infected with HCV, which is causally linked to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (Shimotohno, 1995). The lack of a non-primate animal model and a limited in vitro cultivation system for HCV make vaccine and drug development for the virus challenging (Fried et al., 2002).",

            "text": "The hepacivirus genus, one of the four genera in the family Flaviviridae, comprises of HCV and GBV-B (Stapleton et al., 2011). GBV-B was isolated during the laboratory passage of human plasma (obtained from an individual with unexplained acute hepatitis) through Tamarins and other new world monkey species, but was never again recovered from a human sample (Stapleton et al., 2011). The natural host of GBV-B has thus remained elusive (Bukh et al., 1999, Bukh et al., 2001, Nam et al., 2004, Stapleton et al., 2011). Recently, Kapoor et al. (2011) described a novel virus with considerable genomic similarity to HCV in respiratory samples of domestic dogs and tentatively named it canine hepacivirus. More recently it has also been detected in horse serum (Burbelo et al., 2012, Lyons et al., 2012), and both viruses are currently grouped as non-primate hepacivirus (NPHV). Comparative phylogenetic analysis confirmed NPHV as the closest genetic relative of HCV to date (Burbelo et al., 2012, Kapoor et al., 2011, Lyons et al., 2012). Whether HCV has originated from animal species remains unclear. However, sustained contact between humans and other species increases the likelihood of the emergence of a virus adapted to infect and cross the species barrier.",

More recently, novel hepacivirus has been detected in bats and wild rodents (Drexler et al., 2013, Quan et al., 2013). However, the detection of viral sequences from single tissue or serum samples leaves unanswered questions about the prevalence and tropism of the virus, and its association with disease. In this investigation we examined tissue samples from 210 dogs for the presence of CnNPHV RNA. Due to its potential relevance for hepatitis, and its previously reported detection in respiratory tissues, respiratory and hepatic tissues from a further 20 dogs were examined for the presence of CnNPHV. Clinical respiratory scores and a detailed histological examination of these tissues were undertaken to investigate any association between the presence of CnNPHV, clinical disease and histopathological changes. This is the first study to report the detection of CnNPHV in dogs outside of the USA and the first detailed investigation into the pathogenesis of natural cases of CnNPHV infection in dogs.",

The conserved 5\u2032UTR is important for virus replication/translation and has been used for HCV genotyping (Pestova et al., 1998, Simmonds, 2004). The E1/E2 envelope genes facilitate virus entry into host cells and display the most diverse sequences among HCV genomes (Hijikata et al., 1991, Kato et al., 1992, Weiner et al., 1991). Analysis of the NS3 sequence generated from some of the variants in this study, although based on a short fragment (165 nt), showed that differences existed between the strains detected in this study and with those previously published, but was most similar to the published canine strain AAK-2011 from the USA (Accession no. JF744991) and the equine strain (NZP-1). NZP-1 was previously shown to share high degree of nucleotide identity with the canine strain AAK-2011 (Burbelo et al., 2012, Kapoor et al., 2011, Lyons et al., 2014, Lyons et al., 2012). Likewise 5\u2032UTR obtained from two tracheal variants showed substantial nucleotides similarity to canine and equines published sequences. E1/E2 sequence obtained from one tracheal variant (42-T) showed the least similarity to canine and equine published sequence compared to NS3 and 5\u2032UTR reflecting the heterogeneity of E1/E2 genes among HCV genome (Hijikata et al., 1991, Kato et al., 1992, Weiner et al., 1991). Sequence analysis of E1/E2 and 5\u2032UTR from more samples would be advantageous. Since the main focus of this study was to establish the presence of CnNPHV in the UK canine population further sequence analysis of E1/E2 from more samples was not perused. A standalone dedicated study focused on genomic variation is required. What this study does highlight however, even with the limited E1/E2 sequence obtained, is the high degree of diversity in E1/E2 between CnNPHV genomes, indicating the requirement for more broadly reactive primers to successfully target this genomic region from multiple variants.",

The 7 available histopathological scores of the CnNPHV RNA-positive liver samples had a mean of 0.71 indicative of mild changes. Assuming these dogs were infected with CnNPHV, the liver samples would have been collected at a relatively early stage of viral infection and thus given that in HCV, hepatic lesions are most severe in late-stage chronic infections, we cannot exclude the possibility that more chronic lesions, such as fibrosis or biliary hyperplasia may have developed in these dogs. This latter theory should prompt a wider investigation into the role of CnNPHV in chronic hepatitis, a common and largely idiopathic clinical problem in dogs. Indeed morphological changes in the liver are often preceded by functional changes, such as elevations in hepatocellular enzymes which were not analysed in this retrospective study. Interestingly two recent studies in UK and Netherlands reported the absence of CnNPHV in liver samples from dogs with chronic and idiopathic hepatitis (Bexfield et al., 2014, Drexler et al., 2013). These studies however may not be representative of the global picture.",

However in HCV infection, there is a disparity between the observed numbers of patients with clinical evidence of cirrhosis as compared to the proportion of patients with chronic HCV in whom histological evidence of cirrhosis develops due to the indolent nature of HCV-induced cirrhosis (Sanchez-Tapias et al., 1990). Additionally, HCV replication occurs in the absence of obvious liver damage during the first few months after infection (Shimizu and Purcell, 1989). If CnNPHV has a similar very slow disease progression and the fact that canine species has shorter life span than human, the expected scenario would be that most CnNPHV-infected dogs would probably die before showing any evidence of liver damage. Nevertheless the lack of evidence of histological abnormalities in liver tissues may also be explained by the possibility that these dogs have recently acquired the infection whilst in the kennel. Additionally the age of these dogs ranged from 1 to 4 years old, targeting older dogs would be a useful further strategy to demonstrate any evidence of liver injury.",

To our knowledge this is the first in depth investigation of CnNPHV in the UK dogs. In our study of relatively young dogs (1\u20134 years), we have observed the highest levels of infection in the liver of these animals but, as yet, little evident pathology. It would be valuable to examine older dogs, particularly those with liver disorders to assess whether there is any significant association between CnNPHV and hepatitis. As yet the source of CnNPHV in dogs is unknown. It is possible the virus detected in this study was introduced to these dogs from either contact with other dogs, wildlife or other sources such as vaccine contaminated with animal serum or ingestion of food. Further investigation to examine whether or not CnNPHV is replicating in these dogs is warranted, and a further evolutionary analysis of whole viral genome is required to investigate the natural history of these novel viruses.",

The evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum Likelihood method of the MEGA 6 programme based on the Kimura- 2 Model for NS3, Hasegawa\u2013Kishino\u2013Yano model for E1/E2 and Tamura\u2013Nei model for 5\u2032UTR. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor\u2013Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, where the topology with superior log likelihood of each tree was selected. The numbers at the nodes (bootstrap values) indicate the frequencies of occurrence for 500 replicate trees.
