In this study, we semi-quantified the viral load by the C\nt measure of the h-rRT-PCR. Mean C\nt was higher than the one reported in samples tested by Hurtado et al.,14 who demonstrated a better positive percent agreement with a h-rRT-PCR. Although results from both studies may not be comparable since our h-rRT-PCR, used as the reference method, is probably different to the one used by Hurtado et al., we observed significant differences in mean C\nt between positive and negative samples by AL-Flu. By our results, samples with a C\nt >30 in the h-rRT-PCR would likely give a false negative result. Although high viral loads are expected in patients with Flu if laboratory diagnosis is performed within 48\u201372 h after the onset of symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assays.htm), delayed sampling is feasible, especially during inter-epidemic periods.
