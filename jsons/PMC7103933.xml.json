The noticeable increase of S. sonnei has also been observed in other fast-developing countries [23], and in some areas such as Beijing and Vietnam [6], [24]. S. sonnei has even replaced S. flexneri to become the predominant subgroup. The pattern shift might due to improvements in the economic situation, environmental conditions and hygiene habits in these regions. Another finding was that only two S. sonnei isolates were collected in 2003 during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. Since the main transmission mode of Shigella is person-to-person contact or consumption of contaminated food [25], fewer people getting out and eating out in order to avoid SARS infections may have resulted in the obvious decrease of S. sonnei isolates.",

Resistance to these antimicrobials is commonly reported and the frequency of resistance differs by country. In Belgium, an 18-year research showed that resistance rates to these four antimicrobials were 19.2%, 3.8%, 59.3% and 85.9%, respectively [12].

In addition, in Eastern China high levels of resistance to ampicillin (70.8%), nalidixic acid (69.3%), tetracycline (74.8%) and SXT (73.8%) were reported [9]. The widespread nature of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolone resistance has been documented in many countries [29], [30].

Cefotaxime also had a lower frequency of resistance compared with cefalotin.

Large-scale transmission of different clones was found in different years. In 2009, cluster SC6 containing 33 isolates spread between Changzhou and Nantong; in 2008, cluster SD5 containing 35 isolates was prevalent in Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Lianyungang, Nanjing and Xuzhou; and in 2007, cluster SE1 containing 35 isolates was present in Xuzhou, Lianyungang, Changzhou, Taizhou, Suzhou, Yancheng and Huai'an, a total of 7 cities. Similarly, the clonal spread of S. sonnei has also been described by other studies in Malaysia during 1997\u20132009 [32] and on a global scale [33]. These observations emphasise the necessity of monitoring the molecular subtypes of S. sonnei from endemic regions and controlling outbreaks of S. sonnei.\n",

This study used degenerate primers combined with restriction enzyme digestion to detect class 1, 2 and 3 integrons concurrently. A total of 55.9% of S. sonnei isolates carried class 1 integrons in Jiangsu Province, perceptibly higher than that in Bangladesh (2.5%) [5], South Korea (14.9%) [16] and Zhejiang Province of China (12.9%) [21]. This difference may due to geographical variation or the increased prevalence of class 1 integrons in recent years. Class 2 integrons were detected in 80.3% of S. sonnei isolates, which was in concordance with previous reports (100.0% in Gabon [13], 100.0% in South Korea [16], 81.0% in Uzbekistan [34] and 80.6% in Zhejiang Province [21]). Class 3 integrons were not detected in any isolates. Furthermore, an atypical class 1 integron, ever present in Africa, Europe and America [35], was also detected with a positive rate of 49.4%. Overall, the current study searched for four classes of integron (classes 1, 2 and 3 and atypical class 1 integrons) in all isolates obtained. The results showed that class 2 integrons remained the preponderant integron among S. sonnei strains but it was not as dominant as reported previously. It is well known that classes 1 and 2 and atypical class 1 integrons play an important role in increased antimicrobial resistance. This was supported by the fact that the resistance rates of the class 1 integron-positive group were all statistically higher than the class 1 integron-negative group for all nine antimicrobials, thus integrons were associated with resistance of S. sonnei to multiple antimicrobials at the phenotype level.",

Four of five amplicons carried one or two gene cassettes; only one amplicon (0.15 kb) carried the skeletal structure of 5\u2032CS and 3\u2032CS. The class 1 integron containing 0.15-kb and 2.2-kb amplicons was the most common type in this study, and aacA4\u2013cmlA1 was the most prevalent gene cassette, conferring resistance to aminoglycoside and chloramphenicol, respectively. The gene cassette array dfrA1\u2013sat1\u2013aadA in class 2 integrons conferred resistance to trimethoprim, streptothricin and streptomycin [16], [36]. The gene cassette bla\nOXA-30\u2013aadA1, conferring resistance to \u03b2-lactams and aminoglycosides, was detected in an atypical class 1 integron. The decrease of AMC resistance is probably due to the decrease of the number of strains harbouring an atypical class 1 integron, which contains bla\nOXA-30 encoding an enzyme conferring resistance to AMC. So far, a similar atypical class 1 integron has been reported in China, India and France [21], [37], [38], [39].",
