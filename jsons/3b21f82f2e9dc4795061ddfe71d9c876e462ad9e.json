With the development of the breath-hydrogen test (BHT)a simple sensitive specific and non-invasive test for LM it is now possible to look at this problem. It was shown previously, using the BHT, that 50% of urban European children hospitalized with acute enteritis develop LM.6 In order to determine the prevalence and duration of LM in hospitalized Aboriginal infants and children with acute enteritis, BHT was performed following an oral lactose load. These results were then compared with findings from an earlier study in well nourished urban European children.6 Accurate assessment of clinically significant LM may improve the dietary management of sick infants with diarrhoea, and hence improve their nutritional status.",

The role of LM in this cycle is not defined, but clinical experience in Adelaide and Alice Springs has shown it could aggravate the malnutrition. In this Aboriginal population it is possible that mucosal injury secondary to infection and malnutrition has precipitated the early onset of LM. Only three of 32 infants were lactosetolerant after 3 months which is further support for this hypothesis. It would seem likely that in a population such as this, predisposed to adult onset LM, mucosal injury and malnutrition early in life may move the time frame downwards by several years.I3 In other populations and in studies using an animal model, iron deficiency, protein deficiency and parasite infestation have been shown to be important in the early genesis of lactose malab~orbtion.'~~'~ European children, however, who are not malnourished, with a similar incidence of LM following acute enteritis (Table 2) , recover very quickly with 90% being lactose-tolerant 1 month after the acute illness6",

The pathogenicity of this agent has yet to be determined. However, its role as a causal agent of diarrhoea seems doubtful as it is seen almost as frequently in children without diarrhoea.'^'^ Evidence from earlier studies suggests that Aboriginal children with acute diarrhoea and poor growth recover more quickly and gain weight faster if lactose is restricted.16 As can be seen by the mean age of the patients (15 months) , LM was severe only in the age group taking transition foods and not in the fully breast-fed infant. In the past, the inability to accurately diagnose the cause of continuing diarrhoea and poor weight gain has led to multiple dietary changes and prolonged hospitalization in the hope that extended adequate nutrition would settle their diarrhoeal illness. Previous workers have shown a lack of correlation between simple tests such as the Clinitest and LM.\",l8 However, using the BHT, an accurate diagnosis of LM can be made quickly and distinguished from other intercurrent illness so that appropriate dietary management can be confidently instituted both in hospital and at home. Despite the use of antibiotics prior to admission only 6% of infants were not H2 producers which is similar to European children. LM may also be a factor in the frequent re-admissions. In the population studied, children with LM had significantly more hospitalizations both before and after the diagnosis of LM (Table  1) . Five per cent of the children had evidence of bacterial overgrowth diagnosed by BHT, using previously reported criteria.8 The diagnosis would have been overlooked but for the use of the BHT. Jejunal cultures were not carried out for ethical reasons, but previous experience shows that it would probably not have helped in the diagnosis.* All children responded to appropriate antibiotic therapy.",
