Autoreactivity of anti-Env bNAbs induces central tolerance mechanisms and results in removal of B cells producing antibody with the same epitope specifi city. The heavy chain of 2F5 bNAb was cloned in B cells in mice models and resulted in the loss of B cells expressing mature 2F5 IgM in mice (Verkoczy et al. 2010 ) .

There even is evidence that superinfection with a second HIV isolate can readily occur in HIV-infected persons, leading to the emergence of recombinant virus variants and generating increased virus diversity (Mc Cutchan et al. 2005 ) . HIV-1 integrates itself as latent proviral DNA into the genome of long-lived memory CD4+ T cells, which provide a persistent reservoir of the virus that escapes immune surveillance (Peterlin and Trono 2003 ) . It has been calculated that it would take up to 60 years to eradicate a reservoir of as few as 1 \u00d7 10E5 latently infected cells. The window of opportunity for an HIV vaccine is therefore narrowly limited to the very early stages of infection, before the virus can seed the lymphoid organs in mucosal tissues (Gallo 2005 ) . HIV also has developed multiple mechanisms to circumvent the host immune responses including its ability to downregulate the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and by doing so to minimize its recognition by CTL, as well as its high genetic evolution rates, which allows it to evade immune responses through the emergence of viral CTL (Feeney et al. 2005 ) , and neutralizing antibody escape variants. Another diffi culty with the development of an effective HIV vaccine stems from the fact that the virus envelope glycoprotein conceals its conserved receptor-and co-receptorbinding sites in crypts that are masked by the hypervariable loops of the molecule and by glycan residues (Wei et al. 2003 ) . Neutralizing antibodies induced in response to gp120 are primarily targeted to the hypervariable loops of the molecule, and only rarely do they recognize the receptor-binding sites, which makes it hard to generate broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against primary virus isolates from patients (Yang et al. 2004 ) . Lack in effi cacy of antibody responses raised by monomeric gp120 vaccines in protection against HIV infection has been proven beyond any doubt in the world's fi rst two phase III clinical trials of AIDS vaccines (Mascola et al. 1996 ) , although neutralizing antibodies administered passively to nonhuman primates can provide protection against experimental SHIV infection (Ferrantelli et al. 2002 ) . However, contrary to laboratory-adapted virus strains, which use CXCR-4 as a co-receptor (\"X4\" strains), and against which protection in chimpanzees could readily be achieved by inducing neutralizing antibodies targeted to the hypervariable V3 loop (Girard et al. 1995 ) , primary virus isolates, which use CCR-5 as a co-receptor (\"R5\" strains), are diffi cult to neutralize, which casts doubt on the possibility for a vaccine to elicit protection against infection by the induction of neutralizing antibodies alone. In view of all these problems, recent vaccine approaches have focused on the induction of cellular immune responses (McMichael and Hanke 2002 ) . The induction of a cellular immune response against HIV, especially a CD8+ CTL response, although not being able to provide sterilizing immunity and protection from infection, should hopefully enable vaccines to control virus replication following infection, reduce their virus load, slow down their progression toward disease, and reduce the probability of secondary transmission of the virus. However, some viruses, for some reasons, are not fully amenable to this approach, such as infl uenza, retroviruses, herpes viruses, the slow viruses, rhinoviruses, and arboviruses. Obstacles to the use of vaccines include (1) multiplicity of serotypes, e.g., rhinoviruses and togaviruses; (2) antigenic change, e.g., infl uenza and retroviruses; and (3) latent infections.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 579, "end": 604, "text": "(Mc Cutchan et al. 2005 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 788, "end": 814, "text": "(Peterlin and Trono 2003 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1138, "text": "(Gallo 2005 )", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1497, "end": 1518, "text": "(Feeney et al. 2005 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1843, "end": 1861, "text": "(Wei et al. 2003 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 2170, "end": 2189, "text": "(Yang et al. 2004 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}, {"start": 2405, "end": 2427, "text": "(Mascola et al. 1996 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF84"}, {"start": 2566, "end": 2592, "text": "(Ferrantelli et al. 2002 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2844, "end": 2865, "text": "(Girard et al. 1995 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3228, "end": 3255, "text": "(McMichael and Hanke 2002 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genome and Proteome Complexity of HIV"}, {"text": "Drug resistance is also a major obstacle in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Finally, the viral load has some values in predicting the progress of AIDS. For example, the viral load can predict the probability ( p value) of becoming AIDS in 6 years for patients with normal CD4+ counts. The p value is 0.054 when the viral load is less than 500 copies/ml and the p value dramatically increased to 0.8 when the viral load is more than 30,000 copies/ml. When CD4+ counts are less than 200/\u00b5l, the viral load can be used to predict a shorter progress of AIDS. The probability of turning to AIDS within 3-6 months from viral carrier is proportionally associated with the viral load values. A similar conclusion was drawn from a recent clinical trial including 751 HIV-infected patients with b200 CD4+/mm 3 before HAART (Torti et al. 2007 ) . Patients with higher CD4+ T-cell counts following the treatment appeared to have survived after month 3, whereas those with increasing HIV RNA N400 copies/ml did not.

The fi eld of pharmacogenomics, which relates genetic variability to variability in human drug response, has evolved considerably from candidate gene studies to studies of variation across whole genomes of human populations containing individuals who exhibit a range of responses to different drugs. The initial successes in the fi eld were often the identifi cation of genetic variants within drugmetabolizing genes that had large effects on sensitivity to a given drug. The fi eld has since broadened in scope to encompass regulatory mutations, and refi ned techniques have made us able to identify the mutations with smaller effect sizes. Whereas early pharmacogenomics studies sought primarily to identify associations between common genetic variation and drug response, more recent approaches have begun to identify mRNAs, miRNAs, and other downstream events that are infl uenced by genetic variation and may underlie variation in pharmacologic responses. The primary aim of pharmacogenomics has been to uncover novel human genetic variants that affect therapeutic response phenotypes and to identify the genes responsible for those phenotypic differences. The ultimate goal of the fi eld has been to use an understanding of these relations to devise novel personalized pharmacological treatment strategies that maximize the potential for therapeutic benefit and minimize the risk of adverse effects for any given medication. Advances in DNA sequencing and polymorphism characterization technologies have enabled the fi eld to evolve from the sole reliance on hypothesisdriven approaches to the use of discovery-oriented, genome-wide approach that requires fewer a priori assumptions regarding genetic variants. Candidate gene approaches resulted primarily in the identifi cation of genetic variants in drugmetabolizing genes with large effects on toxicity or response (Weinshilboum and Sladek 1980 ) ; however, many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified novel associations between drug response and genetic variants with unknown functional relevance and often with relatively small effect sizes (Daly 2010 ) . The recent development of high-throughput sequencing techniques has enabled researchers to begin to examine the contribution of rare variants to drug sensitivity (Ramsey et al. 2012 ) .

Genotypic resistance testing has been judged to be cost-effective, even with the relatively high current costs of the tests (Weinstein et al. 2001 ) . At present, the majority of genetic resistance testing for HIV drugs involves sequence-based approaches; however, kit-based tests are expected to become common and testing costs should fall automatically. These tests are also likely to expand beyond the viral genome, as additional polymorphisms in the host genome are linked to HIV treatment outcome. Before exploring the applications of pharmacogenomics on HIV, it is important to understand the underlying biological principles. Genetic variation in the human genome occurs predominantly as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) where single nucleotides differ between humans. An individual's DNA contains as many as ten million SNPs, which are responsible for the diversity of human phenotypes, as well as susceptibility to drugs and diseases (Twyman 2004 ) . Scientists approach the problem of identifying, cataloging, and characterizing SNPs from two different angles -a genomic approach and a functional approach. The genomic approach involves scientists comparing the genomes of numerous individuals to study differences and recording their results in forums such as the dbSNP short genetic variation database hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). This method of SNP characterization requires a large amount of computer-powered data analysis unlike the functional approach where scientists focus on select genes known to be associated with a particular process or disease, and then they examine them across a population (Perelson et al. 1996 ) . In pharmacogenomics, such genetic variation with respect to drug response is studied and used to guide patient care. The primary bioinformatics resource for pharmacogenomics is the PharmGKB database developed by Stanford University that is studying the impact of genetic variation on drug response and focuses on clinical interpretation of variants, drug dosing guidelines, genetic tests, and other information that is practically applicable for actors in the health sector. Even without expanding the numbers of drugs available, however, pharmacogenomics is still incredibly impactful because doses and preferences for existing drugs can be employed for patient care. In fact, some major innovations have already occurred in resistance testing technologies and in HIV treatment selection based on genomics. Genotyping and phenotyping are two established methods for identifying antiretroviral resistance in patients on therapy. In HIV genotyping, a discrete sequence of reverse transcriptase and protease genes in extracted RNA specimens is amplifi ed to generate cDNA amplicon, which then undergoes sequencing. A software system called OpenGene then aligns the sequences, reports mutations, and produces an interpretive report. The interpretation does not provide any insight though with regard to the degree of resistance to a drug because the output has either (1) no evidence of resistance, (2) possible resistance, (3) resistance, or (4) insuffi cient evidence. HIV drug resistance databases also play a key role by providing advanced information to clinicians. Important databases often used in HIV genetic research are the Los Alamos HIV Drug Resistance database and the Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database. The former collects all sequences and focuses on annotation and data analysis. A recent study prepared the database that contains a compilation of nearly all published HIV reverse transcriptase and protease sequences, which are linked to data about the source of the sequence sample and the antiretroviral drug treatment history of the individual from whom the isolate was obtained (Shafer 2003 ) . Another group developed the HIVbase software solution that helps researchers effectively manage DNA/amino acid sequences and related genetic/clinical data using storage and query capabilities (Salemi 2004 ) . Storing genotypic resistance data and linking to other clinical information is an important tool for successful disease management. Examples of such systems that identify mutation patterns associated with resistance are Virodec (Roche Diagnostics) and ViroScore (ABL) published on their diagnostic website. Virodec HIV is an online application engineered to upload, analyze, interpret, deliver, and store genetic sequence data from genotyping assays. ViroScore is an HIV resistance sequence management system with a sequence database that is used by analysis tools/algorithms for resistance interpretation.

However, still more pieces of data are needed to complete the mechanistic picture (Thio and Thomas 2010 ) . The IL28B gene encodes IFNlambda-3, which is one of the recently discovered type III interferons (or lambda interferons), and belongs to the IL10 superfamily (Dellgren et al. 2009 ). Other type III interferons are the cytokines IL28A and IL29. Some murine studies have revealed the preferential expression of IFN-lambda receptors on epithelial surfaces and have suggested that type III interferons may allow the host to rapidly eliminate viruses at the major portals of entry into the body before infection is established, without activating other arms of the immune system (Ank et al. 2006 (Ank et al. , 2008 Ank and Paludan 2009 ). Nonetheless, one important difference established between the murine and human systems is that the interleukin (Liapakis and Jacobson 2010 ); receptor alpha chain (receptor complex induced by IFN-lambda) is expressed in human hepatocytes, whereas the murine liver seems unlikely to respond to IFN-lambda (Ank et al. 2006 , 2008 Ank and Paludan 2009 ). This fi nding suggests that IFN-lambda contributes to host defense against hepatotropic viruses, such as HCV in humans. Like type I interferons, lambda interferons have activity against HCV and other viral infections in vitro and in vivo (Marcello et al. 2006 ) . However, in vitro exogenous IFNlambda induces a slower, more sustained abundance of IFN-stimulated genes than IFN-alpha (Marcello et al. 2006 ) .

Such an analysis for five different protease inhibitors is shown in Table 28 .10 : as prediction of drug effi cacy. The mutation frequency profi le is superimposed at the bottom of the graph, and this analysis clearly identifi es those aminoacyl side chains that mutate with a high frequency and are in close proximity to the bound drug, those that are proximal and stable, those that are distal and mutate, and those that are distal and are stable.

Methionine 184 is located at the heart of the catalytic site of reverse transcriptase, and its replacement by a valine, which has a different side chain, interferes with the proper positioning of lamivudine triphosphate within the catalytic site (Sarafi anos et al. 1999 ) . The M184V mutation induces very high levels of resistance to lamivudine. When lamivudine is used as a single agent, resistant strains overtake wild-type virus in a few weeks (Schuurman et al. 1995 ) , and when lamivudine is used as part of a failing regimen of HAART, the M184V mutation is almost always the fi rst mutation to emerge (Havlir et al. 2000 ) . The group of mutations referred to as the Q151M complex (Iversen et al. 1996 ) (Table 28 .12 ) is most often selected for in the course of the failure of regimens containing stavudine and didanosine. This pathway always starts with the Q151M substitution, a residue located in the immediate vicinity of the nucleotide-binding site of reverse transcriptase, and is followed by the gradual accumulation of secondary mutations that enhance resistance and increase the activity of the enzyme (Kosalaraksa et al. 1999 ) . The Q151M complex is relatively rare in HIV-1 (fewer than 5 % of all HIV strains with resistance to nucleoside analogues) but can confer high-level resistance to most but not all (e.g., lamivudine and tenofovir) analogues (Iversen et al. 1996 ) .

These mutations occur gradually, and their order of emergence can vary. Thymidine analogue mutations promote resistance by fostering ATP-or pyrophosphate-mediated removal of nucleoside analogues from the 3\u2032 end of the terminated DNA strand (Meyer et al. 1999 ) . ATP and pyrophosphate, which are abundant in normal lymphocytes, do not participate in the DNA-polymerization reaction, but the structure of a reverse transcriptase expressing thymidine analogue mutations facilitates their entry into a site adjacent to the incorporated analogue (Chamberlain et al. 2002 ) . In this position, ATP or pyrophosphate can attack the phosphodiester bond that links the analogue to DNA, resulting in removal of the analogue.

Detailed knowledge of the structure of this domain and of the structure of the natural protein substrates of the enzyme has led to the design of specifi c inhibitors whose chemical structure mimics that of the viral peptides that are normally recognized and cleaved by the protease (Roberts et al. 1990 ). These compounds display a strong affi nity for the active site of the HIV protease and inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme in a highly selective manner. Resistance to protease inhibitors is the consequence of amino acid substitutions that emerge either inside the substrate-binding domain of the enzyme or at distant sites (Molla et al. 1996 ) (Table 28 .13 ).

The membranes of the virus and target cell are then brought into close proximity, fostering their fusion, by further rearrangement of gp41. In this step, a distal hydrophobic region of gp41, HR2, folds onto a more proximal hydrophobic region, HR1, effectively shortening the molecule.

Although some of these defi cits can be partially corrected by compensatory mutations (Nijhuis et al. 1999 ) , viruses forced to develop higher levels of resistance under intense and continuous pressure by antiretroviral drugs often have a substantial impairment in their replicative capacity (Barbour et al. 2002 ) . The degree of replicative impairment conferred by resistance mutations is highly variable. The most crippling mutations appear to be those associated with resistance to protease inhibitors (Zennou et al. 1998 ), but signifi cant replicative defects can be related to mutations in reverse transcriptase that confer resistance to nucleoside analogues or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Back et al. 1996 ; Bleiber et al. 2001 ) as well as envelope mutations associated with resistance to enfuvirtide. The clinical effect of resistance-associated loss of viral replicative capacity is the subject of intense investigation. Several observations suggest that resistant viruses have lost some of their virulence. When antiretroviral treatment is interrupted in patients infected with HIV that is resistant to multiple drugs, the resistant strain is more or less rapidly replaced by wild-type virus. This change is accompanied by a drop in CD4 T-cell counts, suggesting that wild-type virus has a greater replicative and pathogenic potential (Deeks et al. 2001 ) . In a signifi cant proportion of patients in whom HAART is failing, the CD4 T-cell counts remain signifi cantly above pretreatment levels, despite the poor control of replication (Kaufmann et al. 1998 ) . Whether this apparent immunologic benefi t of HAART in spite of patent virologic failure is the direct consequence of reduced viral pathogenicity, a sign of persistent residual activity of some drugs in the regimen, or both, remains to be elucidated. Consequently, therapeutic strategies that take advantage of resistance-associated loss of HIV replicative capacity have yet to be identifi ed. However, recent data of CATCH and the US-based studies suggested that transmitted drug-resistant HIV can remain the dominant population in peripheral blood for an extended period of time. Furthermore, a study analyzed the baseline nucleotide sequences among 11 subjects with primary HIV infection who showed variation against antiretroviral therapy (Little et al. 2004 ) . The patients had been infected for approximately 65 days and had at least one major drug resistance mutation. Longitudinal samples were collected for a median of 225 days after infection and analyzed for persistence of transmitted drug-resistant variants. Seven patients had evidence of NNRTI resistance, two patients had resistance to both NRTIs and PIs, and one patient had triple-class resistance. The average time to reversion of the K103N variants to mixed 103 N/K populations in the seven patients with NNRTI resistance was 196 days following the estimated date of infection. In the four patients with mutations conferring resistance to protease inhibitors, no reversion to wild type was detected at 64, 191, 327, and 342 days after infection. Complete reversion of genotypic resistance was observed in only one patient at 1,019 days after infection. Dr. Kuritzkes concluded the data presented at the 11th CROI by a team of investigators at Gilead Sciences (Borroto-Esoda et al. 2004 ) . Study FTC-301A compared once-daily emtricitabine (Emtriva) to once-daily stavudine (Zerit), both combined with didanosine (Videx) and efavirenz (Sustiva), in 571 treatment-na\u00efve patients from North America, Latin America, and Europe. Overall, 90/546 (16 %) evaluable patients entered the study with HIV mutations at positions associated with resistance to NNRTIs. There were no differences in the prevalence or type of mutations between the groups. For subjects with wild-type virus at baseline, the incidence of virologic failure was 12 % in the stavudine group and 5 % in the emtricitabine group.

This reverse reaction of DNA polymerization, termed pyrophosphorolysis, enables reverse transcription and DNA synthesis to resume. Pyrophosphorolysis can be enhanced by key mutations, often referred to as thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs). While pyrophosphorolysis is believed to be the primary mechanism of resistance to zidovudine and stavudine, the process is not drug specifi c in the way that discriminatory mutations tend to be. Consequently, these pyrophosphorolysis-enhancing mutations can confer reduced susceptibility to all of the NRTIs.

For example, the M41L/L210W/T215Y pathway is a common TAM pattern and is associated with high-level resistance to zidovudine and with cross-resistance to other NRTIs, including tenofovir and abacavir. In contrast, the D67N/K70R/K219Q pathway isolate is a less common TAM pattern and is associated with a lower fold resistance than the M41L/L210W/T215Y cluster. It was also showed that T215F mutation rarely appears in the reverse transcriptase of viruses also harboring the L210W mutation or the M41L mutation (Kuritzkes 2004 ) and the divergent TAM pathways (Hu et al. 2004 ) . In a nutshell, these studies found that isolates carrying the T215Y mutation replicated more effi ciently than isolates harboring the 215F mutation. With incorporation of the L210W mutation into isolates harboring the T215Y mutation, viral fi tness was substantially reduced. Conversely, with the incorporation of the K70R mutation into isolates harboring the T215Y mutation, there was a substantial growth advantage in the presence of zidovudine (Hu et al. 2004 ). Thus, it was concluded that T215Y pathway is more common and confers higherlevel resistance to zidovudine and other NRTIs, whereas viruses carrying T215F have lower replication capacity and are poorly fi t.

An example of this phenomenon can be found in a clinical trial of partial treatment interruptions conducted by Dr. Steven Deeks and his colleagues (Deeks et al. 2003 ). This study focused on a cohort of HIV-positive individuals who had a history of excellent treatment adherence, had drug-resistant viremia (greater than 400 copies/ml), and were experiencing a documented treatment-mediated benefi t (e.g., a viral load below and CD4+ cell count above pretreatment levels). The patients either stopped their PI(s) or their NRTIs to determine the selective effects of these two drug classes in terms of maintaining the less-fi t virus. One more study discontinued lamivudine in four highly treatmentexperienced patients with no viable alternative treatment options and evidence of the M184V mutation while on a regimen consisting of at least three antiretrovirals (Campbell et al. 2003 ) . Six weeks after stopping lamivudine, HIV RNA levels increased an average of 0.6 log10 copies/ml above baseline, even though the M184V mutation remained detectable in virus from all patients. This basically showed us that, even in the presence of the M184V mutation, lamivudine was still contributing to HIV RNA suppression. Reversion of M184V to wild type occurred in all four patients between 6 and 14 weeks, accompanied by an additional average increase in viral load of 0.3 log10 copies/ml. Upon resuming lamivudine therapy, the M184V mutation reappeared within 8 weeks in all four patients. The COLATE trial was an open-label trial involving 131 patients experiencing virologic failure while on a lamivudinecontaining regimen (Dragsted et al. 2004 ) .
