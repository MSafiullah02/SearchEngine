These waves propagate through a substrate, and are then transformed back to an electric field for measurement.

Several of the emerging applications for these devices in the medical sciences (biological and chemical sensors) and industrial and commercial applications (vapor, humidity, temperature, and mass sensors) may eventually equal the demand of the telecommunications market. Acoustic devices are generally described by way of their wave distribution, either through or on the surface of the piezoelectric substrate. Basically, acoustic waves differ in velocities and directions of particle movement within the substrate. Depending on the material and boundary conditions there can be different variants. Fig. 12 .1 shows the configuration of typical acoustic wave devices. Transverse or shear waves have particle displacements that are normal to the direction of wave propagation and which can be polarized so that the particle displacements are either parallel or normal to the sensing surface. Shear horizontal wave motion signifies transverse displacements polarized parallel to the sensing surface; shear vertical motion indicates transverse displacements normal to the surface. Some properties of selected acoustic wave devices, including TSM, transverse shear mode (i.e., QCM, quartz crystal microbalance); SAW, surface acoustic wave; STW, surface transverse wave; SH-APM, shear horizontal acoustic plate mode; FPW, flexural plate wave; and TRAW, thin rod acoustic wave, are shown in Table 12 .1 (Rickert et al. 1999) . A wave propagating through the substrate is called a bulk wave. The most frequently used bulk acoustic wave devices are the TSM resonator and the SH-APM. A wave propagated on the surface of a substrate is known as a surface wave. The most broadly used surface wave devices are the SAW and shear-horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) sensors, also recognized as the surface transverse wave (STW) sensor.

The change in the properties of the pathway over which the acoustic wave propagates will result in a change in output signal. While all acoustic wave devices will function in gases or vacuum, only a few operate efficiently in liquids. Whether an acoustic wave device can operate in liquid is determined by the direction of the particle displacement at the surface of the device. TSM, SH-APM, and SH-SAW devices all generate waves that propagate primarily in a shear horizontal motion. A shear horizontal wave does not radiate appreciable energy into liquid, allowing functionality without excessive attenuation. Conversely, SAW devices utilizing Rayleigh waves have a substantial surface-normal displacement that radiates compression waves into the liquid and thus cannot be employed in the liquid phase (Grate and Frye 1996) . An exception to this rule occurs for devices using waves that propagate at a velocity lower than that of sound in liquid.

The QCM usually consists of a thin, round AT-or BTcut (angular orientation in relation to internal crystallography) quartz crystal wafer with two metallic electrodes (e.g., gold, silver, or palladium) deposited uniformly onto both sides of the quartz (Grate and Frye 1996) . The quartz substrate can have varying dimensions and resonant frequencies, the most common being 100 kHz and 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 10 MHz (Scherz 2000) . In itself it comprises an oscillatory circuit that can be modeled as an extended Butterworthvan Dyke equivalent circuit depending upon load conditions ( Fig. 12. 2) (Janshoff, Steinem, and Wegener 2004) . The piezoelectric properties of the quartz result in deformation of the crystal when an electrical potential is created across the electrodes, which in turn induces a transverse, standing wave of resonance oscillation in the quartz at a fundamental frequency (Babacan et al. 2000) . AT-cut crystals displace the oscillation parallel to the resonator surface and are utilized predominantly in liquids, due to their temperature stability. Any changes in the resonance frequency of the crystal are usually attributed to the effect of added mass due to binding at the active (overlapping) area of the electrodes. Theoretical modeling of the TSM response to mass accumulation has been demonstrated under various loading conditions, including ideal mass layers (thin layers of Au and SiO 2 ), a semi-infinite fluid (glycerol in water), and a viscoelastic layer represented by thin layers of oil (Martin, Granstaff, and Frye 1991; Bandey et al. 1999) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 458, "end": 479, "text": "(Grate and Frye 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 617, "end": 630, "text": "(Scherz 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF165"}, {"start": 798, "end": 835, "text": "(Janshoff, Steinem, and Wegener 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1118, "text": "(Babacan et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1727, "end": 1761, "text": "(Martin, Granstaff, and Frye 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1781, "text": "Bandey et al. 1999)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 786, "end": 794, "text": "Fig. 12.", "ref_id": "FIGREF14"}], "section": "TSM Biosensors"}, {"text": "According to theory (Sauerbrey 1959) , when a mass, m, binds at the surface of the sensor, a corresponding proportional decrease of the resonator's oscillation frequency occurs, the total quantity of which can be solved for using Sauerbrey's (1959) equation as follows, provided that the mass creates a rigid, uniform film that does not slip and has the same acousto-elastic properties as quartz:", "cite_spans": [{"start": 20, "end": 36, "text": "(Sauerbrey 1959)", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}, {"start": 230, "end": 248, "text": "Sauerbrey's (1959)", "ref_id": "BIBREF163"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "TSM Biosensors"}, {"text": "where f is the observed change in frequency (Hz) of the resonator under oscillation at its fundamental frequency due to mass loading, Cf = sensitivity factor of the resonator in Hz/ng/cm 2 , and m = change in mass per unit area in g/cm 2 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "TSM Biosensors"}, {"text": "Traditionally, the TSM has served as a mass-sensitive monitor for commercial applications such as thin-film deposition under vacuum, and electroless and electroplating processes.

Influences from numerous non-gravimetric contributions include liquid viscosity and density (Bandey et al. 1999) ; surface free energy (Thompson et al. 1991) ; roughness, surface charge density, and water content of biomolecules (Janshoff and Steinem 2001) ; pressure and temperature (Niven et al. 1993) ; and the viscoelasticity and interfacial effects (Lucklum 2005) of thin films deposited in the form of bioreceptors. Therefore, the use of Sauerbrey's (1959) equation to strictly quantitate mass deposited to the solid-liquid interface under liquid conditions is controversial. Sauerbrey's equation was developed based on the oscillation of TSM in vacuum and only applies to thin, uniform, rigid masses attached tightly to the crystal. Thus, frequency response under liquid conditions cannot solely be attributed to mass deposition (Gizeli 2002; Lucklum 2005) . For example, TSM sensors exposed to relatively large protein and polysaccharide molecules in solution have also been shown to give responses that did not correlate with mass changes at the solid-liquid interface (Ghafouri and Thompson 1999) . The authors ascribed this phenomenon to viscoelastic and acoustic coupling at the interface. One could expect especially complicated interfacial properties when the TSM sensor is exposed to larger biological entities such as bacterial cells. Electromechanical forces created by live and moving organisms may contribute to the apparent mass of binding bacteria. Additionally, factors such as nutrition, growth, differentiation, chemical signaling, and mutagenic exposure may also factor in controlling the physiological state of binding bacteria. A bacterial cell (e.g., E. coli) can possess a mass of approximately 665 fg, making it one million times heavier than a typical (150 kD) antibody molecule (Neidhardt 1987) used as a bioreceptor. Bacteria carry out or are involved with various movements including flagellation, Brownian motion, chemotaxis, swimming behavior, adaptation, and other cell phenomena (Alberts et al. 1994) . Bacterial binding on sensor surfaces may also depend on the presence of fimbriae (Otto, Elwing, and Hermansson 1999) , flagella , or other surface-associated adhesion factors, as well as the ability of single cells to associate and form colonies.

The quantity of phage in virions can be calculated from the total adsorbed biomass, m, by estimating the mass of a single recombinant fd-tet phage at 2 66 \u00d7 10 7 daltons, based on 4000 pVIII outer coat proteins, each containing 55 amino acids with a total molecular weight of 2 35 \u00d7 10 7 (Kouzmitcheva 2005) , and DNA with a molecular weight of 3 04 \u00d7 10 6 .

Biotinylated peptide (4) was coupled with the phospholipid via streptavidin intermediates (3) by molecular self-assembly. Measurements of binding of target vesicles were carried out using a PM-700 Maxtek plating monitor with a frequency resolution of 0.5 Hz at 5 MHz. The device was calibrated with stearic acid monolayers. The deposition of increasing numbers of stearic acid monolayers on the surface of acoustic wave crystal resulted in linear increase of the mass (Fig 12.8b) . The deposition of a single monolayer of stearic acid on the crystal resulted in additional mass of 2 6 \u00d7 10 \u22127 g cm \u22122 . This agrees well with the theoretical estimate based on the molecular area of stearic monolayer in the condensed state (Davies and Rideal 1963) . Binding of streptavidin to biotinylated phospholipid is an important step in immobilization because concentration and orientation of streptavidin molecules determine the properties of a bound molecular probe. The change of mass due to streptavidin binding normally reached 80 ng cm \u22122 , or 8 \u00d7 10 11 molecules cm \u22122 (Fig. 12. 8c-ST).

Unfortunately, the organic solvent often damages the monolayer components and leaves an undesirable residue (Sykora, Neely, and Vodyanoy 2004) .

Organic solvents used as a spreading carrier in LB monolayer preparation may drag these impurities and both forms of antibodies into the monolayer. Furthermore, these methods may produce monolayers with high densities of antibodies but also with residuals of organic solvent, impurities, and entrapped hydrophilic antibodies that destabilize the monolayer and modulate antigen-antibody interactions. A monolayer with no solvent can be formed on the air-liquid interface by allowing the spreading solution to run down an inclined wetted planar surface that is partially submersed into subphase (Fig. 12.10) (Pathirana et al. 2000) . Membrane vesicles (natural components of serum, or the artificial lipid vesicles) are positioned on a wet slide at the edge of a positive meniscus of liquid, at the liquid-air interface. The hydrophobic antibodies are bound to the vesicular membrane; hydrophilic antibodies and some impurities are suspended inside the vesicle. When surface forces rupture the vesicle, it splits into a monolayer and purification occurs. Membrane-bound antibodies are left bound to the newly created monolayer, but soluble antibodies and impurities dissipate into the subphase beneath the monolayer. Only membrane-bound antibodies surrounded by compatible lipids are left when the monolayer is compressed and transferred onto a sensor surface. Alternatively, probes can be conjugated with vesicles by covalent binding (Betageri et al. 1993) . Lipid vesicles containing whole antibodies or Fab fragments can also be constructed.

While antibodies frequently have the desired sensitivity and selectivity, their use is limited by many factors. For example, the binding properties of antibodies may be lost due to unfavorable environmental conditions (Olsen et al. 2003) . This factor can be especially important in dealing with environmental applications, where organic solvents must be used for extraction of compounds (Ahmad and Ahmad 1996) . Also, production of polyclonal antibodies requires a process that is very timeand labor-intensive, and can produce a variable product. Production of monoclonal antibodies is often even more difficult and expensive. These limitations can be addressed in part by using bacteriophage or their coat proteins as recognition elements for biosensors (Goldman et al. 2000; Petrenko et al. 2005; Nanduri et al. 2007 ). Both lytic and filamentous phages present reach libraries to identify proteins interacting with molecular targets. In phage display, the phage filament serves as the framework for random peptides that are fused to the N-terminus of every copy of the major phage coat protein. These random peptides form the \"active site\" of the landscape phage and comprise up to 25% by weight of the particle and up to 50% of its surface area (an extraordinarily high fraction compared with natural proteins, including antibodies) (Nanduri et al. 2007) . A large mixture of such phages, displaying up to a billion different guest peptides, is called a \"landscape library.\" From this library, phages can be affinity selected for specificity to a certain antigen, thus functionally mimicking antibodies. These phages can be efficiently and conveniently produced and are secreted from the cell nearly free of intracellular components in a yield of about 20 mg/ml (Nanduri et al. 2007) . The purification procedure is simple and does not differ dramatically from one clone to another. The surface density of the phage binding peptides is 300-400 m 2 /g, comparable to the best known absorbents and catalysts (Nanduri et al. 2007) , and with thousands of potential binding sites per particle, creates a multivalency. Other advantages of phages over antibodies include the extraordinary robustness of the phage particle. It is resistant to heat (up to 70 C), many organic solvents (such as acetonitrile), urea (up to 6M), acid, alkali, and many other stresses (Nanduri et al. 2007 ). Purified phages can be stored indefinitely at moderate temperatures without losing infectivity (Nanduri et al. 2007 ).

Immobilization of proteins extracted by organic solvents may present difficulties in depositing a correctly orientated layer of proteins on the sensor surface. A better way of phage protein immobilization is to use the intact protein coat of the phage particle. For example, when T2 lytic bacteriophage was subjected to osmotic shock, it lost most of its DNA, but the protein coat or \"ghost\" of the phage was left intact (Herriott and Barlow 1957) . The coat retained the phage shape and some of the biological functions of the phage.

These conditions are difficult to meet on a continuous solid sensor surface. Under natural conditions biological receptors are supported by biological membranes that are interfaced with water solutions on both sides. The Australian group of Cornell (Cornell et al. 1997 (Cornell et al. , 2001 ) devised a multi-step assembly procedure to tether a lipid bilayer containing molecular probes linked to a gold surface. Such a tethered configuration is of interest in general for sensor technology because it creates a water reservoir between the sensor surface and membrane and serves to maintain the bilayer fluidity and facilitate the incorporation of molecular probes. Although this example clearly demonstrates the feasibility of an electrode-supported ion channel-based sensor, it suffers from several serious problems. First is the shear complexity of the synthetic approach; using thiol-and lipid-based self-assembly techniques, six different reagents are sequentially organized onto the gold surface. Second, because the tethers are randomly positioned on the electrode, weaker unsupported regions of the membrane could collapse. Finally, there appears to be no obvious patterning procedure. To overcome the above problems and in addition develop qualitatively new functionalities, thin porous substrates of silica have been developed (Fan et al. 2000; Jiang et al. 2006; Nishiyama et al. 2006; Xomeritakis et al. 2007 ).

It is possible that the bacterial microenvironment and location of the antigen on the surface of a bacterium can determine the value and sign of the analytical signal generated by the acoustic wave device (Olsen et al. 2003) . Bacterial positioning and binding may be very important at the solid/liquid interface of the sensor and factors such as viscoelasticity, shear forces and damping. For example, in our studies using Salmonella and E. coli antibodies as receptors (Olsen et al. 2003) , when attachment between bacteria and bacteria-specific somatic O antibodies at the solidliquid interface of a TSM resonator was rigid and strong, the sensor's output was directly proportional to the logarithmic concentration of free bacteria in suspension, and the sensor's behavior could be described as that predicted by mass theory ( f < 0) (Fig. 12.19a) .

Dybwad's (1985) results were affirmed by Vig and Ballato (1998), who stated: \"Significant deviation from the Sauerbrey equation will also occur when the mass is not rigidly coupled to the QCM surfaces. The effects of liquids have been discussed in the sensor literature [references given]; however, the effects of nonrigid coupling of solids do not seem to be well- Olsen et al.

When k = K, a composite system is formed that produces expected mass loading effect with corresponding frequency decrease. known. For example, when a particle is placed on an electrode of a QCM, the Sauerbrey equation predicts a decrease in the frequency of the QCM, but the frequency actually increases. When the particle on the resonator is modeled as a coupled oscillator, the model correctly predicts a frequency increase [as verified by Dybwad (1985) ].\" This type of behavior has been documented in the literature on several occasions. Berg, Johannsmann, and Ruths (2002) used a single asperity contact to show that frequency shifts associated with a quartz resonator operating in shear mode increased linearly with increasing contact radius. Borovsky et al. (2001) used a nanoindenter probe in conjunction with a QCM to elicit positive frequency shifts characteristic of the contact stiffness. Sorial and Lec (2004) experienced size-dependent frequency increases with polystyrene spheres using a QCM under aqueous conditions. Otto et al. (1999) observed diminished, f < 0, response for weaker bacteria attachment using an E. Coli QCM sensor. Other documented reports of negative apparent mass using QCM-based platforms include Hayden et al. (2003) and , in response to loose binding of bacterial cells in yeast imprinted layers; Dickert et al. (2004) , due to loose binding of non-specific compounds to tobacco mosaic virus imprinted polymers; Marxer et al. (2003) , who attributed frequency increases to alterations in cytosolic viscosity of adsorbed epithelial cells; Thompson, Arthur, and Dhaliwal (1986) , due to immunochemical interactions resulting in decreased acoustic transmission at the liquid/solid interface; and Pereira de Jesus, Naves, and Lucia do Lago (2002), as a result of polymeric film stiffness in the determination of boron. More recently, Lucklum (2005) described non-gravimetric contributions of viscoelastic films at the solid/liquid interface, resulting in positive frequency shifts. He clearly showed that typical elastic and energy dissipation properties are as important to frequency response, both positive and negative, as the layer's mass and therefore in many cases the added mass cannot be determined simply from the QCM response alone.

Thus, in Fig. 12 .24, the observable resonance corresponds to + branch when the bacteria binding is weak ( 0 < 0 , but is given by \u2212 branch when the binding is strong ( 0 > 0 ). Hence, there are two systems corresponding to the two marked rectangular areas in Fig. 12 .24. First, for weak bacteria binding ( 0 < 0 ) the resonance frequency increases in contradiction to the intuitive expectation that the addition of the bacterial mass to the oscillator will decrease the frequency. The positive frequency shift grows when the bacteria binding 0 increases and approaches the frequency 0 . The second system corresponds to strong bacteria binding ( 0 < 0 ) when the resonance frequency decreases as expected for mass added to the oscillator. In this case For weak attachment ( 0 < 0 ), the real part of this complex number is negative. This means that for small the bacteria and quartz surface oscillate with the phase shift close to 180 , i.e., anti-phase. Hence, the bacterial oscillator pushes the quartz oscillator towards the equilibrium position (Fig. 12.25 ). This increases the restoring force and thus also increases the resonance frequency of the quartz oscillator.

This suggests using a strong attachment method to achieve a low bacteria detection threshold. Importantly, a substantial linear range of detection occurs that is especially broad for weak attachment. This allows finding the number of attached bacteria by calibration measurement of only the initial slope of the response curve. Additionally, we modeled the effect of inhomogeneous bacterial binding strength.

These results are also valid in the realistic case of non-zero damping ( /2 M = /2 M = 1 Hz), as shown inFig. 12.25. Again the resonance frequency shift is positive for weak and negative for strong bacterial elastic binding.The different behavior for weak and strong bacterial attachment can be understood from the bacterial oscillator equations of motion. We evaluate Eq. (12.9) at the frequency 0 Resonance curves for different bacteria elastic binding strengths at 0 (no binding), 2, 3, 10, and 100 MHz, as noted.
