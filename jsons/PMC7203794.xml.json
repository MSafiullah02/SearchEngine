An updated meta-analysis demonstrated that multi-drug resistance among new and retreatment cases was 4.8 and 26.3%, respectively [3]. In a national survey of drug-resistant TB (DRTB) conducted in China, 34.2% of patients developed new TB infections, while 54.5% of previously-treated patients developed resistance to at least one of the four first-line anti-TB drugs [4]. In China, the cure rate for retreatment PTB was approximately 50.0\u201373.3% [5\u20137]. In many cases, retreatment represented the patient\u2019s last chance of a cure. The standard anti-TB treatment regimen for retreatment PTB was isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin for 2 months (2HRZES), followed by isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol for 6 months (6HRE), daily for 8 months. It increased the use of second-line injection of streptomycin and extended the consolidation period when compared with newly-treated TB. Several adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal symptoms, liver function impairment, and renal insufficiency often affected the patient\u2019s compliance, which was not conducive to treatment outcome [8].",

By consulting ancient texts and clinician\u2019s judgment of more than 1000 cases of PTB from the mid-1960s to the 1980s, the compound decoction of Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis), Baibu (Stemona stemonae), and Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhizae) was found to be effective in treating PTB [14, 15]. Based on herbal medicine records, Baibu, Huangqin, and Danshen were important drugs for the treatment of PTB, which improved the cure rate of PTB. To improve drug efficacy and administration, tablets were prepared following an aqueous saturated lime precipitation and ethanol extraction method. The formulation was changed to tablets to improve clinical convenience. QBDT have been widely used in Shanghai since the mid-1980s, even in patients with DRTB [16].",

Baicalin was identified as a potential inhibitor of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteasome with more than 65% inhibitory activity [17]. Tuberostemonine has been widely used as an antibacterial drug, especially in complex formulations [18], and may play a role in inhibiting TB resistance by altering the streptomycin resistance protein RpsL (encoding the ribosomal protein S12), and by enhancing the streptomycin-sensitizing effect [19]. Tanshinone is beneficial in the recovery of patients after TB infection by decreasing hypoxic injury and inhibiting calcium accumulation [20]. Both in vitro and in vivo, QBDT may have bacteriostatic effects on TB bacteria by improving hemorheology, inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration, and toxin secretion [21\u201323]. According to recent studies, QBDT can upregulate the expression of Toll-like receptor 2, which is one of the mechanisms through which QBDT acts against TB infection [24].",

Secondly, the dosage forms of the tablets and decoction were different in some of the components.

The data demonstrated that adjuvant therapy using QBDT improved the sputum negative conversion in patients who were sensitive or resistant to pyrazinamide, ethambutol, streptomycin, thereby suggesting that QBDT may not directly act on bacteria and primarily activated host immunity to clear a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Surprisingly, patients who were sensitive to pyrazinamide tended to significantly improve the negative conversion rate. It is currently recognized that the addition of pyrazinamide to the anti-TB regimen can shorten the long-term treatment course, which is equivalent to the \u201cguide herbs\u201d in the compatibility of TCM prescriptions. Therefore, in pyrazinamide-sensitive patients, the two \u201cguide herbs\u201d including pyrazinamide and QBDT may show a stronger sputum negative culture effect. Although we did not observe a significant difference overall, there was a trend to improvement in sputum conversion.",

TCM might mainly focus on the pathological aspects of disease, such as the immune inflammatory response, including systemic and localized lesions caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, changes in blood circulation, and the body\u2019s metabolic state, in addition to the removal of pathogenic micro-organisms. The beneficial characteristics of TCM allow for more of a \u201cholistic view\u201d, and pay more attention to the overall changes in the body\u2019s disease state.
