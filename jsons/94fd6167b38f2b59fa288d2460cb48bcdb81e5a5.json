            "text": "Nutritional requirements are very simple and herbivore manure can provide abundant organic acids such as propionate and acetate. 7 The organism was formerly known as Corynebacterium equi and Mycobacterium equi. 8, 9 Currently, this bacterium is classified in the family Nocardiaceae of the order Actinomycetales, but a proposal was made in 2013 to reclassify it as Prescottia equi. 10 R equi is distributed worldwide with a highly variable pattern. 2 This bacterium has zoonotic potential and has been increasingly reported in immunocompromised human patients. [11] [12] [13] The pathogenicity of R equi infection in horses has been extensively studied and well documented. Dogs, cats and other domestic and wild animals are also susceptible to this ubiquitous bacteria. 14 Virulent R equi survives and multiplies in alveolar macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells by inhibiting maturation and acidification of the phagosome. 4 The major routes of transmission are inhalation and ingestion. 2 The lungs have been described as a predilection site in foals manifesting chronic pyogranulomatous bronchopneumonia. 15 The most common abdominal manifestation is diarrhoea associated with ulcerative enterotyphlocolitis. 16, 17 Extrapulmonary disorders (EPDs), such as ulcerative lymphangitis, pyogranulomatous lymphadenopathies, pyogranulomatous hepatitis, peritonitis, pericarditis, granulomatous meningitis, subcutaneous abscess, immune-mediated polysynovitis, haemolytic anaemia, osteomyelitis and septic arthritis, have also been reported in foals. 18 Manifestation of EPDs with primary predilection sites of infection has been correlated with a poor survival rate of 43%, as compared with 82% of cases without EPDs. 16 In humans, pneumonia is the most common manifestation along with EPDs, as outlined by Khurana. 2 For example, abscess of the brain, 19 meninges, peritoneum and thyroid gland; fever; diarrhoea; lymphadenitis; pericarditis; polysynovitis; osteoarthritis; osteomyelitis; colonic polyps; 20 mass in the lungs; granulomatous mastitis; 21 and endophthalmitis specifically in immunocompromised patients have been documented. In another study comparing the mortality rate of rhodococcosis in human patients, the highest mortality rate was reported to be in people with HIV, followed by immunocompromised non-HIV-positive patients with rhodococcosis, and the lowest mortality rate was in immunocompetent patients. 22 The overall mortality rate in human patients has been reported as 25%. 23 There is a paucity of information and documented data on R equi infection in cats. Three studies on feline pulmonary rhodococcosis have been reported from Italy, the USA and Australia. 4, 24, 25 These studies characterised R equi infection in cats and compared it with the disease reported in a highly susceptible host; that is foals. Two previous studies reported feline pulmonary rhodococcosis based on the history, clinical presentation and cytological evaluation of the tracheal exudate without any necropsy confirmation. Immunosuppression was suspected in these cats based on the intestinal lymphoma in one cat and clinical presentation only in another cat. 4, 24 Radiographic features of feline pulmonary rhodococcosis have not been described to date because of the limited number of cases reported. In foals, radiographic findings include an unstructured interstitial pattern, various combinations of the alveolar pattern, nodular or cavitary lesions and lymphadenopathy, especially tracheobronchial and pleural effusion. Furthermore, the severity of radiographic finding significantly correlated with the survival of the foals infected with R equi. 26 The aim of this study is to describe the clinical manifestations, diagnostic options, radiological features, therapeutic plans and outcome for cats infected with R equi.",

Radiographs were reviewed by two veterinarians to reach a consensus. Severity criteria for radiographic pulmonary patterns were adopted from a study by Crisi et al, 27 where bronchial signs were categorised as mild, moderate and severe based on the first-, second-and third-generation bronchi visibility. Alveolar patterns were categorised as mild when there was presentation of isolated fluffy infiltrates, moderate when the pattern was well defined with air bronchograms and severe with lobar signs. Interstitial changes were categorised as mild when an interstitial framework was visible but when a bronchial pattern was suspected as well the moderate category included an interstitial framework distinguishable from bronchial; and the severe category was recorded for undisputed reticular interstitial patterns. Visualisation of a vascular pattern was aided by the relative enlargement of pulmonary vessels between the artery and vein.",

Other non-specific signs documented were weight loss, coughing, lethargy, pyrexia, ocular/nasal discharge, vomiting and diarrhoea. Cyanosis of the mucous membrane was also noted in one case. Cutaneous lesions reported in four cats and topographical locations were soft tissue swellings around the neck area; left distal carpal, proximal mediocaudal aspect of the left forelimb; right distal radius and ulna up to digits; and open wounds around the caudoventral chest area with an intact thoracic wall. remaining four cats manifesting the cutaneous form of the disease, samples were collected through fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of abscess and sterile cotton swabs from contaminated open wounds. Large, mucoid, nonhaemolytic salmon-pink colonies, suggestive of R equi, were processed further by performing conventional biochemical tests for identification of bacteria. 28 Haematology and selected blood biochemistry parameters were evaluated. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested in some cases by the Kirby Bauer technique. 29 Thirty-seven cats in this study received antibiotic(s), and were assessed for recovery and outcome based on the records of subsequent visits to the University Veterinary Hospital (UVH). Seventeen combinations of antibiotics are outlined in the 'Results' section for the pre-and post-diagnosis phases of disease management, and the outcome is shown with prominent circumstances that have been linked to these cases. Owners were also contacted by the hospital via telephone to obtain information on the post-treatment outcomes in cases where they did not return for follow-up appointments.

In pre-thoracocentesis radiographs, severe alveolar, mild interstitial and mixed (alveolar-interstitial) patterns were the predominant findings and noted in 55.5%, 50% and 86.1% of cases, respectively. The most prominent post-thoracocentesis patterns were severe alveolar (58.3%), moderate interstitial (41.7%) and alveolarinterstitial (52.8%). Mixed radiographic patterns (97.1%) were the predominant findings in post-thoracocentesis radiographs. A solitary pattern was not significant in both pre-and post-thoracocentesis radiographs.",

A free-roaming lifestyle confirmed the correlation between the occurrence of rhodococcosis and the outdoor lifestyle of cats, as reported in canine and equine cases. 32,33 About 50-95% of horse farm soil samples are reported to contain R equi, 6 but in these cats there was no history of exposure to such a risk factor, and this was also confirmed by telephone interview. Recently, a study from Denmark reported R equi to be one of the resident aerobic microbiota of a healthy nasal cavity in humans, which can later become an opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. 34 This could be an interesting topic for future prospective or experimental studies in Malaysia, because of the higher incidence of disease. The cumulative incidence of R equi pneumonia in foals is not dependent on the soil concentration of the virulent strain, but air-borne concentrations have been positively correlated with the disease. 35 This remained unproven in the current and previously reported feline studies. 4, 24, 25 Inhalation of the aerosolised virulent pathogen is one of the main modes of transmission in foals. 15 One of the most recent case studies where a cat was brought to a horse farm suggested the possibility of the same mode of transmission as the cat was without any history of an injury or wound. 4 Contrary to all previous reports, the possibility of close contact between cats and horses was less likely for the reported cases in this study, because all the cats lived in urban areas ( Figure 8 ) and contact with farm animals was highly unlikely. In a previous study of cats and dogs on the virulence of documented R equi isolates, infected patients, which usually acquire the infection from environmental exposure, were not considered to be a source of human infection. However, it is probable that the cats' and dogs' discharges may possess some theoretical risk to immunocompromised owners.",

These results correlated well with the type and presence of characteristic lesions (pyogranulomatous) in equine cases. 16, 24 It was hypothesised that as the intestine is one of the principal sites of predilection in foals, the same would be true for cats; however, the findings of the present study revealed that only 5% of cats had gastrointestinal signs vs 33% in foals. 18 This suggests that the pathogenesis in cats may be different from that in horses. Previous feline rhodococcosis studies did not report any significant gastrointestinal signs. 24, 25 Passamonti et al 4 reported diarrhoea as an initial sign, followed by severe respiratory signs, which lead to acute death. There have been reports in horses with subclinical presentation of the pulmonary form with spontaneous recovery, but this mode of pathogenesis and presentation have not been reported in cats to date. 16 Pyrexia was noted in 34.3% of the cats, but this variable has been considered less important in the modern clinical picture of this infection in horses, after the advancement in disease diagnosis at the subclinical stage. 1 Lethargy was reported in 20% of cats vs 53% of foals. 41 Pneumonia with respiratory distress and tachypnoea were predominant clinical presentations in foals, 42 as well as cats, as shown in the present study.",

This pattern correlated well with the reported case studies of foals. 42, 43 Acute septicaemic presentations were the predominant cause of band neutrophilia and monocytosis, often accompanied by left shift. 44 Chronic stress and increased glucocorticoid activity are indicated by neutrophilia and monocytosis, in combination with lymphopenia and eosinopenia. 44 Of the cats examined, 19.4% showed lymphopenia, along with neutrophilia and monocytosis. Based on these results and the clinical manifestations in the cats studied, it seems that septicaemia in cats with R equi infection did not occur From the biochemistry results, changes in protein levels such as low-normal albumin (n = 36) being a negative phase protein with a mean \u00b1 SE value of 28.34 \u00b1 0.849 (range [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] and high globulin (n = 36) being a positive acute phase protein with a mean \u00b1 SE value of 50.14 \u00b1 1.463 (range were prominent findings noted in cats in the present study. Protein levels in equine cases can be influenced by physiological factors, such as age, pregnancy, and clinical infections and inflammatory processes. 40, 45 In cats, these changes have also been attributed to systemic diseases, haematological disorders, chronic infections, inflammatory process and neoplastic disorders. 46 Hence, these physiological and clinical scenarios highlight the value of protein level changes in cats and horses, especially in ongoing infections and inflammatory processes. An alternative and major differential diagnosis for a low A:G ratio (median value for 36 samples in the present study was 0.6; range: 0.5-1.4) is FIP, 47 which should be excluded first in this type of clinical finding. Changes in protein levels accompanied by clinical presentations should not prevent clinicians from making a differential diagnosis of R equi infection in the prior screening list. The sample size for parameters such as phosphorus, gamma glutamyl transferase, aspartate transaminase, creatine kinase and total bilirubin are too limited to correlate with other species.",

The lack of these signs in feline cases could mask R equi infection with other possible infections invading the pulmonary cavity; hence, cytology and isolation of bacteria should be performed for a definitive diagnosis.",

In cats, cases suspected of having, or with evidence of, pleural effusion should be sampled by thoracocentesis, and chronic infectious pneumonia without thoracic fluid signs should be sampled via bronchoalveolar lavage. 49 Macrophages were seen in 71% of samples submitted for cytology where phagocytosed bacteria usually presented with activated or foamy/vacuolated cytoplasms, 50,51 as shown in Figure 4 . The histological characteristics of lung tissue were also similar to dogs, including pyogranulomatous inflammation and the presence of intrahistiocytic coccobacillus bacteria. 33 Therapy and outcomes After diagnosis, there are several options for pyothorax case management, but the optimum method is yet to be determined, as management depends on the clinical scenario of acute presentation and the decision-making process of the client and practitioner. 52 Conventionally, it has been divided into surgical and medical management. Currently, thoracic drainage along with the usage of antimicrobial agents is considered the mainstay of therapy. 53, 54 Thoracic drainage can be considered with single-or repeated-needle thoracocentesis. Other possible options for chest drainage are chest tube thoracostomy, diagnostic and/or therapeutic thoracoscopy and thoracotomy, which can be integrated with a single or multiple lavage, intermittent or continuous suction and intrapleural fibrino lytics administration, and also can be helpful in sample collection. 54 In the present study, eight cats with the pulmonary form of the disease were managed by chest tube placement: four recovered, two were euthanased and two died during long-term management of the disease.",

Diagnostic and/or therapeutic thoracocentesis was performed in 33 cats presenting with acute respiratory distress while receiving oxygen by face mask or the flow-by method. Concurrent fluid therapy with shock rate was also considered in patients presenting with septic or distributive shock. After this acute management phase, IV antibiotics were administered during the initial course of the disease and were finally replaced by oral antibiotics. All cats that were boarded and required needle thoracentesis more than twice after initial chest tapping were advised to be managed further with chest tube placement. Further indications for chest tube placement included the inabillity to achieve negative pressure at the end of thoracocentesis, if the patient was deteriorating despite multiple needle thoracentesis, and if daily lavage and continuous or intermittent suction was required, and after thoracotomy surgery. 55 In antimicrobial susceptibility testing in vitro there might be a wide range of antibiotics that can be effective, but the use of lipophilic antibiotics (ie, macrolides), especially erythromycin and rifampin in combination, has been recommended in foals because of the potential in vivo synergism, penetration in caseous material and macrophages, and remarkable improvement in the clinical status of the infected patients. 56 The same seems to be an effective combination for cats, given the outcome after their use in pre-and post-diagnostic management. In the past, potentiated amoxicillin and tetracyclines were relatively better choices for feline rhodococcosis (used against any serotype). 24 In the present study, they showed very poor susceptibility. Macrolides, gentamicin and enrofloxacin showed similar results, 24 noted in this study. The major difference observed in treatment outcome was that 3/4 cats (cutaneous form) in this study died without any appropriate response to antibiotics, compared with the cutaneous cases in a previous study, 24 where all cats recovered (n = 5). Contamination could be a suggested source of infection for the cutaneous form, without any concrete evidence of the immune status of the cats in the present study.",
