Similar control measures were extended to the entire province of Hubei by Jan 26, 2020.3 Non-pharmaceutical physical distancing interventions, such as extended school closures and workplace distancing, were introduced to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.4 Within the city, schools remained closed, Lunar New Year holidays were extended so that people stayed away from their workplaces, and the local government promoted physical distancing and encouraged residents to avoid crowded places. These measures greatly changed age-specific mixing patterns within the population in previous outbreak response efforts for other respiratory infectious diseases.5, 6 Although travel restrictions undoubtedly had a role in reducing exportations of infections outside Wuhan and delayed the onset of outbreaks in other regions,7, 8 changes in mixing patterns affected the trajectory of the outbreak within Wuhan itself. To estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, we look at Wuhan, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world.",

In mid-January, 2020, schools and workplaces closed as part of the Lunar New Year holidays. These closures were then extended to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread. The intended effect of such physical distancing measures was to reduce person-to-person contact, which spreads infectious diseases. Epidemic parameters, such as time-dependent reproduction numbers governing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Wuhan, have been estimated based on local and internationally exported cases. The frequency of contacts in different age groups and locations (schools, workplaces, households, and others) in China has also been previously estimated. We searched PubMed and medRxiv for studies published in English up to March 7, 2020, with the terms \u201ccoronavirus AND (school OR work) AND (Wuhan OR Hubei)\u201d and identified 108 and 130 results, respectively. However, to our knowledge, no published article has reported use of location-specific transmission models that consider the impacts of school or workplace closures to study the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan.\nAdded value of this study\nWe built an age-specific and location-specific transmission model to assess progression of the Wuhan outbreak under different scenarios of school and workplace closure. We found that changes to contact patterns are likely to have substantially delayed the epidemic peak and reduced the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Wuhan. If these restrictions are lifted in March, 2020, a second peak of cases might occur in late August, 2020. Such a peak could be delayed by 2 months if the restrictions were relaxed a month later, in April, 2020.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe measures put in place to reduce contacts in school and work are helping to control the COVID-19 outbreak by affording health-care systems time to expand and respond. Authorities need to carefully consider epidemiological and modelling evidence before lifting these measures to mitigate the impact of a second peak in cases.\n",

Under the context of a large-scale ongoing outbreak, contact patterns would drastically shift from their baseline conditions. In the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, physical distancing measures, including but not limited to school and workplace closures and health promotions that encourage the general public to avoid crowded places, are designed to drastically shift social mixing patterns and are often used in epidemic settings.4 Although contact patterns can be inferred from reported social contact data that include information on which setting the contact took place in, such studies are often focused on high-income countries,11 or particular high-density areas.12 This limitation can be addressed by quantifying contact patterns in the home, school, work, and other locations across a range of countries based on available information from household-level data and local population demographic structures.13\n",

Susceptible individuals might acquire the infection at a given rate when they come in contact with an infectious person and enter the exposed disease state before they become infectious and later either recover or die.

Consequently, if these restrictions are lifted prematurely, while there are still enough susceptible people to keep the R\ne>1 once contacts increase, the number of infections would increase.

Epidemiological investigations during the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 found many infections clustered around households.34 Extreme physical distancing measures, including school closures, workplace closures, and avoidance of any public gatherings all at once can push the transmission to households, leading to increased clustering of household cases.5 As households are not explicitly included in the model, we did not consider heterogeneity and clustering of household transmission. Distinguishing between repeated and new contacts is important for disease propagation in contact network models;35, 36 more sophisticated methods that account for temporal presence within the household37 would be needed to characterise higher degrees of contact. Looking at limitations of our study, our compartmental model does not capture individual-level heterogeneity in contacts, which could be important in super-spreading events, particularly early in an epidemic. Combined with nosocomial infections, the risk of COVID-19 infection is potentially amplified with close contact between confirmed cases and health-care workers. However, the compartmental model we present is not equipped to explicitly consider transmission within health-care institutions and households. More complex models, such as individual-based models with familial and health-care structures, should be explored. Nosocomial infection risk among health-care workers and patients has been identified as a research gap to be prioritised in the next few months by WHO.",

It is difficult to quantify whether physical distancing alone is responsible for the drop in cases, especially during the ongoing epidemic. Therefore, we took a broad view of this question, making assumptions about the results of certain forms of physical distancing and measuring the effects somewhat qualitatively. However, to some extent, physical distancing has resulted in both a shorter epidemic and a lower peak. Given what is known about the transmissibility and (the relatively long 5\u20136 days) incubation period of COVID-19,1, 16 the efficacy of physical distancing in reducing these important attributes of any epidemic are no surprise.",
