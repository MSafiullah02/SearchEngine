This Taskforce developed a surge algorithm that was divided into 3 tiers driven by the number of COVID-19-positive patients both in the San Francisco area and at UCSF Health System, as well as staff shortages (Fig. 2\n). On March 5, 2020, perioperative services and surgery representatives were added to the COVID-19 Surge Planning Taskforce after it was recognized that adjusting perioperative care would be a crucial step in managing available resources, including hospital beds, ventilators, blood products, and PPE.",

In addition to immediate modifications to the daily workforce, a disaster plan was also developed in the event of major reductions in staffing across the entire hospital. The disaster staffing plan identified core competencies that would be required to maintain basic general and cardiovascular services at the hospital, as well as the candidate faculty and fellows who could provide those services. This core group was preserved for the Department of Surgery and those faculty who were not comfortable providing those services were identified as potential faculty to redeploy to other work areas, such as the inpatient units and emergency department. This strategy was developed across all 3 main sites the department faculty staff\u2014Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco VA Medical Center, and UCSF Health. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital is the only Level I trauma center for the entire county. Therefore, core faculty from the other sites, not normally on the trauma service, who were comfortable with trauma, were identified and credentialed at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital in the event of a major workforce shortage. Fellows were planned to be redeployed as faculty. A resident system was developed to efficiently identify and organize trainees that were not currently on clinical rotations (ie laboratory residents) and could transition into clinical care should it become necessary.",

It is remarkable that in 2 weeks we have dramatically changed the way we approach surgical care and come together as a community for the greater good of our city and patients. The speed with which this has occurred is unprecedented. Historically, guidelines have been updated, on average, every decade. For example, the CDC Surgical Site Infections Guidelines spanned 18 years (1999 to 2017). In contrast, the UCSF PPE guidelines have been updated daily. This rapid response has been facilitated in part by the transdisciplinary engagement at UCSF Health and the Department of Surgery, as well as by the increasingly connected surgical community around the country and world. Much efficiency was gained by having guidelines from colleagues at other institutions to serve as starting points for our efforts. For example, the UCSF Health PPE guidelines for the operating room were accelerated by reviewing the Johns Hopkins Medicine operating room PPE guidelines. Similarly, the Department of Surgery staffing approach was informed by that put forward by the National University Hospital in Singapore.",

Importantly, the leadership group rapidly facilitated addressing the department\u2019s questions (such as management of COVID-19-positive faculty) with the local experts when needed. This was essential in a very complex and rapidly changing landscape to dispel falsehoods, address real concerns, and escalate issues to hospital leadership.8\n,\n15, 16, 17\n",

For example, within divisions, because of the restricted hospital-based staffing, some patients were reassigned to other surgeons who had similar skill sets. Throughout the department, it was essential that there was a level of trust between providers that everyone was prioritizing what was right for the patients and staying within the parameters of the case triage system.

Today, most academic departments encompass faculty that perform operations at many hospitals. As a department comes together in a crisis like this, it is essential that the leadership is sensitive to the unique policies and microenvironments in which our faculty and learners practice. For us, this was highlighted with the PPE policy. UCSF Health was a day or 2 ahead of Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and the San Francisco VA Medical Center with regard to PPE use standardization. This caused a sense of inequity and concern around potentially increased exposure for faculty based at the latter 2 sites. After this lesson learned, when developing a guideline around the use of laparoscopy in the era of COVID-19, the leadership team was sensitive to develop one that would work in all 3 practice environments, where there are variations in supplies, equipment, and vendors.",

The benefit of city ordinances was that we had clear direction and were charged simply with execution.

With the healthcare landscape changing in the setting of daily (even hourly) updates to our understanding of the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical that we come together as a surgical community to efficiently disseminate high-quality information based on experience and data. Virtual communication has permitted an agility in sharing best practices, recording and codifying them, and then adjusting them to the unique local milieu, allowing providers to respond faster and wiser.

It is anticipated that working through this backlog will be complex as COVID-19 anxiety continues to heighten and evolve.
