            "text": "patients (27%) had received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (median interval to COVID-19 infection: 209 days, range 113-749). Most patients (60%, nine) had received chemotherapy in the 15 days prior to the COVID-19 infection. Chemotherapy had to be interrupted or delayed in six (40%). Seven (47%) patients were hospitalized due to the COVID-19 infection, four (27%) were already hospitalized (nosocomial infection), and four (27%) were managed in the outpatient clinic. The most frequent symptoms were fever (67%, 10) and cough (40%, six). Two patients were asymptomatic. Chest radiographs were performed in most patients (93%, 14), with pathological findings in 57% (8/14). Noteworthy laboratory findings included median white blood cell count at diagnosis of 3195 (range 90-10 690), median lymphocyte count of 580 (range 0-6310), and median D-dimer 291 ng/mL (range 0.7-2620). Most patients received hydroxychloroquine (73%, 11), three of them in different combinations (including azithromycin, tocilizumab, lopinavir-ritonavir, corticoids, remdesivir; Table 1). Four (29%) patients did not receive any treatment. No COVID-19 treatment-related severe adverse events were identified. Two patients required oxygen therapy (nasal cannula, <2 LPM), one of them still requiring support. All patients presented favorable clinical outcomes so far, although four of them remained hospitalized. The median hospital stay due to the infection was 8 days (range 3-26). Given that the estimated total number of pediatric oncology patients in the Madrid region is 1140, we observed a COVID-19 infection rate of 1.3% among this patient population over the first 2 months of the pandemic. This study is particularly relevant for several reasons. First, it presents all pediatric oncology patients infected with COVID-19 in Madrid, one of the epicenters of the pandemic. Second, it provides an accurate estimation of the real incidence for this patient population, as both the total number of susceptible patients and the total number of infected patients are well known. For the former, the robustness of the local tumor registry (RTMAD) was the key; for the latter, the well-established collaboration network among pediatric oncologists in Madrid enabled the identification of all infected patients. Furthermore, the fact that children with cancer are considered high-risk patients for the COVID-19 infection leads to thorough and repeated testing in this population, even in asymptomatic patients. This is not the case for the general pediatric population, as most healthy children are not being tested for COVID-19 unless they require hospitalization. Hence, we believe the accuracy of the calculated infection prevalence among pediatric oncology patients to be notably reliable, as opposed to estimations in the general pediatric population or in other subpopulations.",
