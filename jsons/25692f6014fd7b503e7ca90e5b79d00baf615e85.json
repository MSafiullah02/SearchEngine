            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an ongoing emergence enveloped virus with a singlestranded positive-sense RNA genome, belongs to the Gammacoronavirus genus in the Coronaviridae family. IBV-associated tracheitis, nephritis, salpingitis, proventriculitis and egg drop have caused devastating economic losses to poultry industry worldwide. Since the end of 2018, a remarkably increasing number of commercial broilers and layers, vaccinated or not, were infected with IBV in China. Here, we described two IB outbreaks with severe respiratory system or kidney injury in IBV-vaccinated commercial poultry farms in central China. Other possible causative viral pathogens, including avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Kedah fatal kidney syndrome virus (KFKSV), were excluded by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and three virulent IBV strains, HeN-1/China/2019, HeN-2/ China/2019 and HeN-101/China/2019, were identified. Although the gross pathologic appearance of these two IB outbreaks was different, the newly identified IBV strains were all closely related to the ck/China/I0529/17 strain and grouped into GI-19 genotype clade based on the sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 genes. Moreover, there are still some evolutionary distance between the newly identified IBV strains, HeN-101/China/2019 in particular, and other GI-19 strains, suggesting that Chinese IBV strains constantly emerge and evolve towards different directions. In conclusion, this study provided an insight of the recently emerging IBV outbreaks in IBV-vaccinated commercial poultry farms and identified the genetic characteristics of three virulent GI-19 IBV strains, which shows the need to carry out proper preventive measures and control strategies.",

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the causative agent, is an ongoing emergence enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, with genome length about 27.6 kb. It is the prototype of the Gammacoronavirus genus in the Coronaviridae family (Bande et al., 2017; Masters & Perlman, 2013) . IBV mainly targets the respiratory tract of its natural host-chicken, causing severe respiratory system disease, and spreads via respiratory and feco-oral routes. Additionally, IBV also infects the uro-genital tract, digestive system and reproductive system, resulting in nephritis, salpingitis, proventriculitis and egg drop (Bande et al., 2017; Jackwood & Wit, 2013; Sjaak de Wit, Cook, & van der Heijden, 2011) .",

As a highly mutable coronavirus, however, the continuous emergence of novel IBV strains greatly emasculate vaccines efficacy, and the low cross-protection rates of IBV vaccines inevitably hamper the prevention and control of the disease (Fan et al., 2018; Jordan, 2017) .",

The first case of IB in China dates back to early 1980s, and since then, the outbreaks were constantly emerging and numerous IBV strains were identified, of which strains in genotype GI-19 (refers to the QX-like or LX4) became predominant among chickens currently, although the QX strain was initially identified in 1996. Additionally, other genotypes of IBV, such as GI-1 (Mass), GI-7 (TW-I or TW-like), GI-13 (4/91-like), GI-16 (Q1-like) and GI-22 (YN-like and SAIBK-like), were also frequently detected in China (Han et al., 2018; Li et al., 2012; Lin & Chen, 2017; Mo et al., 2013) . Importantly, several novel IBV genotypes, including GI-28, GI-29 and GVII-1, were identified recently Jiang et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2019) . All these indicated that the IBV strains circulating in China are genetically diverse, providing a potential platform for recombination and greatly challenging the current biological control measures. (Bande et al., 2017; Han et al., 2011; Li et al., 2012) . GI-1 genotype vaccine H120 has been the most widely used vaccine in China until now, which shared a very low homology of identity with the emerging GI-19 strain HeN-1/China/2019 (32.2%)",

All these results indicated the GI-19 genotype strains were constantly evolving. In China, the genotype GI-19 vaccine QXL was just approved in the last year (data from the National Veterinary Drug Basic Information Database of China). The continuous emergence of IBV variants undoubtedly facilitates evading immune protection induced by vaccination, as well as adapting to new environment, which would greatly challenge the efficacy of the newly developed vaccine.Since the end of 2018, a large number of IBV outbreaks emerged in vaccinated commercial broilers and layers in China, indicating that the efficacy of currently used vaccines, including H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A, was not effective for the circulating GI-19 genotype.Fortunately, one live attenuated vaccine targeting GI-19 genotype has been licensed in 2018, which might provide an effective role in controlling the disease in China. The result also highlights the importance of further surveillance to define the variations and distribution of this virulent strain of IBV among the Chinese flocks, which helps to carry out proper preventive measures to limit its devastating effect for poultry industry.In conclusion, this study identified two virulent GI-19 IBV strains in IBV-vaccinated commercial broiler farm during the recent wave of IBV outbreaks in China. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these newly identified IBV strains are closely related to the ck/ China/I0529/17 strain. However, there are still some evolutionary distance between the newly identified IBV strains and other GI-19 strains and contain several special amino acid mutations in the HVR regions of S1 protein, suggesting that Chinese IBV strains constantly emerge and evolve towards different directions. This study provides an insight on recently emerging IBV outbreaks, which shows the need to carry out proper preventive measures and control strategies.ACK N OWLED G EM ENTSWe are very grateful to Mr. Jingsheng Xu (Henan Qixiang BiologicalEngineering Co.
