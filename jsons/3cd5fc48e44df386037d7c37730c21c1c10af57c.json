Although various 43 technologies already exist for the sterilization of medical equipment, most of them are not 44 applicable for eliminating virus from face masks. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a 45 fast and easy method of disinfecting contaminated face masks. In this study, using a human 46 coronavirus (HCoV-229E) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 contamination on face masks, we 47 show that the virus loses its infectivity to a human cell line (MRC-5) when exposed for a short 48 period of time (1 min) to ozone gas produced by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma 49 generator. Scanning electron microscopy and particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) tests 50 revealed that there was no structural or functional deterioration observed in the face masks 51 even after they underwent excessive exposure to ozone (five 1-minute exposures).",

Ozone gas is a strong oxidizing agent with the ability to kill viruses on hard-to-reach 56 surfaces, including the fabric structure of face masks.

There already exist technologies for the sterilization of medical equipment, 77 including personal protective equipment (PPE); these technologies include autoclave 78 treatment, ethylene oxide gassing, ionized hydrogen peroxide fogging and hydrogen peroxide 79 vaporization. 2 However, most of them are not practical for disinfecting face masks with SARS-80 CoV-2. 2 It was reported that ozone gas produced by plasma generators can inactivate various 81 types of viruses on different surfaces, including porous ones. 3-6 Ozone is a powerful oxidizing 82 agent, but it does not linger. Its production, involving the use of electricity and a normal 83 atmosphere, is easy and inexpensive. However, it has not been determined whether ozone 84 gas can disinfect face masks contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 without compromising the 85 filtration efficiency of the masks. 86 Here we show that a human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) 7,8 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 on 87 face masks lost its infectivity to a human cell line (MRC-5) when exposed to gaseous ozone 88 produced by a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma generator 9 for a short time (1 min) 89 (Figure 1). Neither structural nor functional deterioration of the face masks even with 90 excessive exposures (5 times, 5 min per each time) to the ozone were observed by scanning 91 electron microscopy (SEM) and a particulate filtration efficiency (PFE) test. Interestingly, RNA 92 of HCoV-229E on the face masks by the ozone for 5 min was amplified by reverse transcription 93 polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

SEM and PFE tests revealed that there was no structural or functional UV absorption spectroscopy209    The ozone concentrations produced by the DBD plasma generator were measured via UV 210 absorption spectroscopy.16  Light from a mercury lamp (BHK 90-0005-01, spectral line: 253.65 211 nm) was collimated using lenses and an optical fiber and sent through a gas medium, 4.3 cm 212 above the electrode surface where the plasma is produced. The transmitted light intensity 213 was then measured using a spectrometer (AvaSpec-2048L). As the wavelength-dependent214 absorption cross section of ozone is broad near 253.65 nm and known as 1.137 \u2022 10 \u221217 215 cm 2 molecule -1 , the ozone concentration can be evaluated by the Beer-the exposure, the virus particles on the samples were collected by washing 240 the samples with 5 mL of PBS. qRT-PCR was performed using StepOne TM Real-Time PCR system 241 (Applied biosystems, CA, USA) and MG 2X One Step RT-PCR SYBR\u00ae Green Master Mix reagents 242 (Cancer Rop Co Ltd., Seoul, Korea). A segment of the N gene of HCoV229E was amplified using GGCAGTCAGGTTCTTCAACAA) 13 with an amplicon size of 83 bp (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea). The 245 thermocycler conditions were as follows: reverse transcriptase at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min and an 246 initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 247 annealing at 52 \u00b0C for 30 s, and an extension at 72 \u00b0C for 30 s. To confirm that the target 248 amplicon was properly formed, a melting curve analysis was conducted. The fluorescence 249 intensity was measured within the range of 60-95 \u00b0C at a rate of 0.2 \u00b0C/s. 250 SEM 251 A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM-EDS, JSM7500F, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, (2), is then evaluated by measuring the concentrations of paraffin oil mist upstream and 266 downstream of the mask.
