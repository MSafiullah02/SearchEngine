Remyelination was somewhat more prominent in the late phase of chronic infection and was associated with a marked astroglial response. In contrast, experiments with a more attenuated WW strain of TMEV with outbred Swiss male mice resulted in greater remyelination by Schwann cells or oligodendrocytes.h' This result correlated best with diminution of the inflammatory response in animals infected with WW virus compared to D A virus.",

With the observations of Raine and Traugotth2 in mind, a series of experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that immune factors contribute to the extent of remyelination following infection with the DA strain of TMEV. Lang ef ~11.~\" found that DAV-infected mice treated by injections of MBP plus galactocerebroside in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) had areas of extensive remyelination. Similar results were obtained with infected mice injected with spinal cord homogenate (SCH) plus IFA. These results were similar to those of Raine and Traugott\" in promoting remyelination in guinea pigs with chronic EAE.",

Normal syngeneic SJL/J mice were divided into three groups and injected subcutaneously in the flank with a I-mg dose of SCH in IFA, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in IFA (l:l), or PBS alone. Serum was collected and passively transferred into mice chronically infected with DA virus. Of interest is that TMEV-infected animals treated with serum from mice given SCH had extensive areas of remyelination that were 6 to 11 times greater than those in the control groups (FIG. 1) . Oligodendrocytes were clustered in groups, suggesting proliferation. The addition of SCH sera to oligodendrocytes grown in tissue culture resulted in three-to fivefold proliferation as measured by the incorporation of tritiated thymidine. This finding suggests that a factor is present in the sera of mice immunized to SCH that promotes new myelin formation and proliferation of oligodendrocytes. The identity of the factor remains to be determined. Preliminary studies suggest that the active factor is in the immunoglobulin fraction of sera. In addition, lymphokines may be important in triggering oligodendrocytes to divide and myelinate.",

Determining the precise viral polypeptides recognized by T cells during the demyelinating process will be important in understanding FIGURE 1. Extensive remyelination by oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord of an SJL/J mouse infected with the DA strain of TMEV ( 6 months) and treated for 1 month with sera from a mouse hyperimmunized to spinal cord homogenate (SCH sera). Note three oligodendrocytes (0) making contact with newly synthesized myelin in the area of remyelination. New myelin formation in the CNS is characterized by abnormally thin myelin sheaths compared to axon diameter (star). One demyelinated axon that has not undergone remyelination is shown by the arrow. The area of remyelination in mice treated with SCH sera was significantly greater (p < 0.01) than that in mice treated with control Similar areas of remyelination were seen in TMEV-infected mice treated with a purified IgG preparation of SCH scra.
