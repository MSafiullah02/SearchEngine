            "text": "Peptides were synthesized on Rink amide MBHA resin (Novabiochem AG, Laufelfingen, Switzerland) by using the F\u2010moc strategy as described previously (29). Several peptides contain a lysine residue at their C terminus with an 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethyl\u20102\u2010thizolyl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyl\u20102H\u2010tetrazolium bromide side chain protecting group (Novabiochem) that requires a special deprotection step under mild acidic conditions [two 1\u2010min washes of 5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dichloromethane (DCM) and 30 min of 1% TFA in DCM]. This enables the conjugation of a lipid moiety or a fluorescent probe to the C terminus. Conjugation of hexadecanoic (palmitic) acid (C16) or \u03b1\u2010tocopherol succinate (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, Rehovot, Israel) to the N terminus of selected peptides was performed using standard F\u2010moc chemistry. Conjugation of cholesterol to the N terminus of a peptide was performed by adding 10 equivalents of cholesteryl chloroformate (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA, USA) dissolved in DCM, together with 3 equivalents of triethylamine to the peptide resin. Conjugation of d\u2010erythrodihydrosphingosine (d\u2010erythro\u2010sphinganine; Matreya, LCC, State College, PA, USA) to the N or C terminus of a peptide was performed as follows: first, 10 equivalents of N,N\u2010disuccinimidyl carbonate (Chem\u2010Impex International, Wood Dale, IL, USA) and 20 equivalents of N,N\u2010diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) were added to the resin for 2 h in dimethylformamide (DMF). Then, 2 equivalents of sphinganine and 2 equivalents of DIEA were added for overnight incubation in DMF anhydrous. Addition of NBD\u2010F, a fluoride [4\u2010fluoro\u20107\u2010nitrobenzofurazan (NBD)] fluorescent probe (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA), to the N or C terminus of selected peptides was performed in DMF for 1 h. All peptides were cleaved from the resin by a TFA/double\u2010distilled water/N\u2010tris(hydroxymethyl) methyl\u20102\u2010aminoethanesulfonic acid (93.1:4.9:2, v/v) mixture and purified by reverse\u2010phase HPLC to >95% homogeneity. The molecular weight of the peptides was confirmed by platform electrospray mass spectrometry. For hydrophobicity tests, the peptides were eluted with a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min using a 2\u2010step linear gradient from CH3CN/H2O (20:80, v/v) to CH3CN/H2O (95:5, v/v) in 30 min and from CH3CN/H2O (95:5, v/v) to CH3CN/H2O (95:5 in 10 min, v/v) on a Nucleosil analytical C2 column (7\u2010\u03bcm particle size, pore size 100 \u00c5; Macherey\u2010Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).",

The infectivity of HIV\u20101 HXB2 was determined using the TZM\u2010bl cell line as a reporter. Cells were added (2\u00d7104 cells/well) to a 96\u2010well clear\u2010bottomed microtiter plate with 10% serum\u2010supplemented DMEM. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18\u201024 h to allow the cells to adhere. The mediam was then aspirated from each well and replaced with serum\u2010free DMEM containing 40 \u03bcg/ml diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)\u2010dextran. Stock dilutions of each peptide were prepared in DMSO so that each final concentration was achieved with 1% dilution. On addition of the peptides, the virus was added to the cells diluted in serum\u2010free DMEM containing 40 \u03bcg/ml DEAE\u2010dextran. The plate was then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h to allow the infection to occur. Luciferase activity was analyzed using the Steady\u2010Glo Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Sometimes cell\u2010washing experiments were performed, as follows: peptides were preincubated with TZM\u2010bl cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, followed by 3 washes with culture medium to remove unbound peptides and the addition of HXB2 viruses to start the infection. After 18 h, the antiviral activities of the remaining peptides that survive the washing were determined by measuring luciferase activity as described previously. For the virus treatment experiment, the virus was diluted in 100 \u03bcl of serum\u2010free DMEM, and sphingopeptides were added in DMSO to a final concentration of 2 \u03bcM. After a 10\u2010min incubation at room temperature, 400 \u03bcl of PBS was added. The sample was then centrifuged using Amicon centrifugal filters (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) with a 30\u2010kDa cutoff for 15 min at 10,000 g. The viruses were recovered (40 \u03bcl), and their infectivity was tested using the TZM\u2010bl cell line as described above.",

This is a deep cavity on the surface of the grooves of the NHR trimer that is important for stabilizing the trimer; it interacts with the CHR to maintain the stability of the gp41 core (35, 36) However, a synthetic N peptide derived from the pocket domain (termed N17) was not active in inhibiting viral infectivity up to 4 \u03bcM, the maximal concentration tested (Table\n1). We conjugated to N17 the following hydrophobic moieties (Fig. 1\nB, C): dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine), which forms the backbone of dihydrosphingomyelin (27, 28); cholesterol; and palmitic acid, which is a building block in many lipids, including phospholipids. For a comparison, we also conjugated to N17 tocopherol, a hydrophobic noncellular compound. The hybrid compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit viral infectivity. Notably, the inhibitory activity of N17 depends on the nature of the lipid moiety (Table 1 and Fig.\n\n2\n). Sphinganine was the most prominent one and potentiated the antiviral activity of N17 into the nanomolar concentration range. This exclusive inhibitory activity of sphinganine\u2010based peptides (sphingopeptides) was further observed in a wider spectrum of viral entry systems, consisting of different HIV strains (wild\u2010type HXB2 and LAI) and different target cells (TZM\u2010bl reporter cells and Jurkat T cells), as well as in cell\u2010cell fusion assay (Fig. 2).",

The rationale followed the report by Bewley et al. (39) for N36 peptides, in which these mutations completely abrogated N\u2010peptide antiviral activity. Alternatively, we randomly reorganized the N17 sequence to give scrambled peptides (Fig. 3\nC). None of the mutant N17 peptides or their sphinganine conjugates showed antiviral activity (Fig. 3\nD). In addition, a 17\u2010mer N peptide was synthesized from the same region as N17 but shifted in its sequence from the gp41 pocket (the peptide termed ShN17; Fig.\n4\nA). Sphingopeptides comprising the ShN17 sequence exhibited antiviral activity that was 7.3\u2010fold lower than those with the pocket sequence (Fig. 4\nB).

We then investigated whether the ability of sphinganine to potentiate the activity of short N peptides could be exploited to other peptides from the gp41 core. Therefore, a short 19\u2010mer C peptide from the CHR, termed DP19, was synthesized (Figs. 1\nB and 4 A).

Accordingly, this amplification of fusion inhibition is not restricted only to N peptides. It can be implemented in other short fragments from different regions within the gp41 core.",

These were mainly explored by cholesterol depletion from viral and host cell membranes, together with altering the cellular sphingolipid metabolism before virus\u2010cell fusion (43\u201348). Much less, however, is known about the recruitment of specific lipid moieties to the site of fusion during the dynamic HIV fusion reaction. A substantial enrichment of dihydrosphingomyelin was observed in HIV particles that bud from their host cells (10). Thus, we hypothesized that its dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine) backbone may penetrate into the site of membrane fusion mediated by the HIV Env. To investigate this, we conjugated sphinganine as well as other lipids to short, otherwise inert, peptides from the HIV\u20101 Env core and their antiviral activities were investigated in several types of HIV\u20101 infection assays. The only lipid moiety that endowed potent antiviral activity to the peptides was sphinganine (a summary of the inhibitory IC50 is presented in Supplemental Table S1).",

Corresponding IC50 values of LAI and AD8 were 312 \u00b1 83 and 403 \u00b1 70 nM. B) Helical wheel representation demonstrates the interaction between the NHR regions of HIV gp41 in the core structure of the hairpin conformation, as observed in the crystal structures. Intermolecular association between the N helices occurs between positions a and d of the helical wheel. C) Mutational analysis of N17 interactions. In the N17mut(a,d) mutant (39), the residues at positions a and d of N17 were replaced by residues at positions f and c, respectively, of the CHR (residues are underscored). Residue numbers correspond to the HXB2 gp160 variant. In the scrambled N17 mutant, the residues of N17 were randomized.
