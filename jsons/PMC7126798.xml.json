            "text": "These patients highlight the co-infection with MERS-CoV and influenza. The exact reason to have a negative influenza test at the time of positive MERS-CoV is not completely understood. It is possible that the presence of MERS-CoV inhibits the PCR reaction for influenza virus. However, an earlier case of MERS-CoV tested initially positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.4 On the other hand, the positivity of nasal swabs for influenza is specimen type and technique dependent.5 Thus, initially negative influenza tests could be a false test result. Positive results for viral respiratory pathogens should not preclude testing for MERS-CoV because co-infection can occur.6 Only a small number of MERS cases had co-infection with influenza A, parainfluenza, herpes simplex, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.7 In one case, a co-infection with Herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA13 and rhinovirus RNA14 were detected by RT-PCR.8 The investigation of the first 47 cases showed no co-infection with MERS-CoV.2 There is a controversy regarding the risk of increased or decreased severity of co-infections. For example co-infections with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human meta-pneumovirus (hMPV) causes more severe infection than either virus alone with longer hospitalization and oxygen requirement.9 Other studies did not demonstrate these effects.10 The association and the impact of co-infection with MERS-CoV and influenza viruses deserve further evaluation and studies.",
