To determine the ability of 6 common hematological and biochemical tests, measured at hospital admission, to differentiate between patients with SARS and patients with CAP due to other causes, we compared the results from a database of SARS patients with those from a database of CAP patients. The SARS database contained information on 144 patients with SARS from the first phase of the Toronto SARS outbreak, which occurred from March through May 2003. A description of this database has been published previously [8]. Cases were identified by clinicians at all Toronto-area hospitals caring for \u2a7e10 patients with SARS and were entered into the database if they met the 4 April 2003 CDC case definition for suspect or probable SARS. The definition for suspected SARS consisted of the presence of fever, respiratory symptoms, and an exposure history; the definition for probable SARS included suspected SARS plus abnormal chest radiograph findings consistent with pneumonia [1]. Ethics approval for this study was obtained through the research ethics boards at all participating hospitals and from the University of Toronto.",

The discriminatory ability of the ANC is likely caused by elevated ANCs seen in cases of bacterial CAP rather than by any abnormality of the ANC in patients with SARS. The value of the ANC in clinical practice will be limited for several reasons. First, no cutoff ANC was identified that was both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of SARS. Second, in clinical practice, it will be necessary to distinguish not only between SARS and CAP but also between SARS and other causes of fever and respiratory symptoms, including influenza, other viral respiratory tract infections, and congestive heart failure. Because these other conditions, unlike bacterial CAP, do not typically cause elevations in the ANC, it is unlikely that the low normal ANC typically seen in cases of SARS (median ANC, 3.85 \u00d7 109 cells/L) will be capable of distinguishing between SARS and nonbacterial causes of CAP.",

            "text": "The present study has several limitations. First, serological confirmation of the diagnosis of SARS was not obtained for all patients. However, serological test results were positive for 97% of patients tested, and the results of the analysis did not differ when patients without serological results were excluded. Second, because the CAP database did not measure laboratory values over time, we were unable to examine trends in laboratory values after hospital admission. Therefore, it remains possible that greater differences between the laboratory values in patients with SARS, compared with patients with CAP, might occur later in the illness. However, laboratory tests performed late in the course of illness would not help in distinguishing cases of SARS from cases of CAP at the time of initial assessment, when decisions regarding hospital admission, isolation, and treatment must be made. Furthermore, the patients with SARS in this cohort presented to the hospital at a median of 5 days (interquartile range, 3\u20137 days) after the onset of their symptoms. Given the widespread awareness of SARS, in future outbreaks, patients will likely present earlier, further limiting the value of tests that may not be discriminatory until late in the course of the illness. Third, we examined each test individually but were unable to perform a multivariable analysis because an insufficient number of patients in the CAP database had data for all 6 laboratory values. However, because no individual test demonstrated good discriminatory ability, because the results of several of these tests are unlikely to be independent, and because testing of all paired combinations of tests did not significantly improve discriminatory ability, it is unlikely that any aggregate measurement of these tests is likely to be useful in the diagnosis of SARS.",

            "text": "Since the global SARS outbreak was declared over on 12 June 2003, sporadic cases of animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV\u2014like viruses have continued in southern China, and 11 cases of SARS have resulted from laboratory transmission in Singapore, Taiwan, and China [32]. Because the confirmation of a diagnosis of SARS now depends on either serological testing for SARS-CoV (the results of which may not be positive for up to 28 days) or PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV (which continue to have limited sensitivity and specificity early in the course of disease), initial assessment of potential SARS cases continues to rely heavily on clinical, radiographic, and epidemiological factors. However, the assessment of patients from southern China with unexplained febrile respiratory illness is complicated by the difficulty of identifying direct epidemiological links in the absence of a recognized outbreak. Therefore, physicians and public health authorities continue to struggle with the difficult task of assessing patients for SARS when they present with unexplained febrile respiratory illnesses, particularly if the patients are travelers from or residents of southern China. As a result, national and international public health authorities have continued to develop and revise case definitions in an attempt to improve their diagnostic accuracy. Some have advocated for the inclusion of routine hematological or biochemical test data (in particular, the ALC) in the case definition, given the frequency with which lymphopenia has been reported in association with SARS [27].",
