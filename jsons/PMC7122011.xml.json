For example, the SENTENCE table contains information on individual sentences such as SENTENCE_ID, PubMed ID (PMID), and the sentence. The PREDICATION table contains various information about predications such as PREDICATION_ID, a SENTENCE_ID, PMID (PubMed ID), PREDICATE, SUBJECT_CUI, SUBJECT_NAME (preferred name of the subject of the predication), and similar fields for the object of the predication. We loaded SemMedDB version 24 to a MySQL database. The examples explained below are based on this version. Figure 8.1 shows a visualization of a network of semantic predications in Neo4j, a graph database. The visualization shows that the semantic connections are unevenly distributed. Some entities are connected by a lot of semantic relations, whereas some are connected by few connections. The unevenness implies a level of uncertainty.\n",

As illustrated in Table 8.1, a complex and time-consuming query with multiple table joins in a relational database can be reduced to a simple and efficient query in a graph database in Neo4j with the Cypher query language. The query in the graph database is in Cypher, a powerful query language supported by Neo4j. The query is to find paths that start with a doctor node and connect to a therapy node through at least four other types of nodes in between. A Cypher query shares some similarities with MySQL queries in terms of their style.\n",

Burst detection (Kleinberg 2002) is a generic algorithm that can be used to identify the level of attention as a type of burstness over time. If a semantic predication appears at a much higher level of frequency than other semantic predications within the same research domain, then intuitively, the semantic predication is having a burst. The duration in which a relatively high-level frequency is observed defines a duration of burstness. If multiple levels of frequency are observed in association with a semantic predication, then the predication may experience hierarchically related bursts. For example, a semantic predication concerning the semantic relation between virus and infection may have a level of frequency higher than some relatively rare diseases in the Semantic MEDLINE, thus, the predication may have a long period of relatively low-level burstness. From time to time, the semantic predication may have an even higher level of frequency, e.g., when particular types of virus, such as HIV, H1N1, and SARS are involved.",

Each red bar depicts the duration of a burst, which is a period in which the frequency of the occurrences of the predication is considerably higher relative to that of other predications at the same time. The overall profile of the red lines suggests that (1) the burstness of a predication tends to shift over time and (2) the burstness of a predication becomes relatively short except the first few long-lasting ones.

The program was designed to serve as a special funding device to support high-risk and high-reward research that is unlikely to get funded through the traditional evaluation system. Citation counts, expert interviews, and the results of a survey all indicate a successful SGER. On the other hand, the evaluation of the program reveals that the NSF program directors were perhaps overly conservative\u2014they spent far less than the allowable funds that were ear-marked for exploratory research. The program directors remained risk averse even with a program particularly designed to encourage transformative research. Similarly, Laudel and Glaser (2014) studied links between epistemic properties and institutional conditions for research based on projects funded by the European Research Council (ERC).

However, with the resolution at the article level, it is difficult for us to address many more specific questions. A semantic predication represents a semantic relation between two concepts. Usually, one of the concepts is called the subject and the other is called the object. The semantic relation represents how the subject and the object are connected semantically.

The timestamp registers the time when the semantic predication appears in our dataset for the first time.

For example, we can run a burst detection to see which semantic predications have abrupt increases in their occurrences. We can divide a network of semantic predications into clusters so that we can see which semantic predications tend to be discussed together. We can generate timeline visualizations and see how they evolve over time. We can perform a structural variation analysis and identify novel connections between semantic predications.

Proposers are usually researchers who are visionary and creative. Novel connections that have the potential to broaden the current knowledge space are considered most valuable. The introduction of such new connections is likely to transform the state of the art of a scientific field. This stage may correspond to the first stage of Shneider\u2019s four-stage evolution model, i.e. the conceptualization stage. The key to the next stage is whether the novel connection can establish itself and attract enough followers to contribute towards the further development of the idea, including applying the original idea to a broad range of domains.

The resultant Pathfinder network preserves the links that satisfy the triangle inequality condition, which make the remaining structure more representative of salient semantic predications. Each cluster is labeled by the most representative concept selected by log-likelihood ratio tests in CiteSpace. For instance, Cluster #3, labeled as hiv and located near the upper right of the diagram, contains concepts such as hiv, human immunodeficiency virus, cmv, aids, retrovirus, hiv-1, and infections. Cluster #4, labeled as infectious mononucleosis and located in the mid-right area, contains concepts such as Epstein-barr virus (ebv), adenovirus, herpesvirus, and kaposis sarcoma. Dashed lines linking concepts in distinct clusters depict novel or unprecedented semantic connections at the time they appeared in MEDLINE. Such novel cross-cluster semantic connections are considered to have transformative potentials (Chen 2012).",

Since the concept is a major node in Cluster #4 given the font size of its label, the burst of the concept may indicate the emergence of Cluster #4 to a new level.

The five dashed lines are novel links introduced by a 1999 MEDLINE article authored by Ellen Feigal (PMID: 9989205), entitled \u201cAIDS-associated malignancies: research perspectives.\u201d These novel connections are derived from the following statement in the article\u2019s abstract: \u201cThe appearance in 1981 of a usually rare malignancy, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, in homosexual men [1] was one of the first harbingers of an epidemic caused by a retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\u201d More interestingly, these concepts belong to different clusters in the network. Linking concepts across different clusters draws our attention to this article\u2019s transformative potential. FEIGAL1999 is in fact a review article. It highlights some recent findings from the vantage point of the year 1999, including\n\u201cdiscovery of a new gamma-herpes virus, human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) or Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV), in 1994 which led to a rapid series of investigations strengthening links of this virus in the pathogenesis of all forms of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (KS) [2]\u201d\u201cassociation of a rare type of B cell tumor called primary effusion lymphoma with HHV8 [3];\u201d\n",

The FEIGAL1999 review article introduced five transformative links because it focuses on infectious agents that share common etiological roles in viral infection, immune dysregulation, and cancer pathogenesis. Since the review pulls together the existing knowledge and current advances from distinct research communities such as molecular biology, immunology, virology, and anti-viral therapy, the FEIGAL1999 review is essentially serving the role of a broker of intellectual ideas originated from different disciplinary blocks.
