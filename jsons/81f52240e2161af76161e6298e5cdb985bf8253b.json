A variety of strategies for decontamination of PPE are under investigation, including use of ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide vapor. 2 However, sending used respirators to a central processing facility for hydrogen peroxide vapor treatment is likely to be labor-intensive and costly and ultraviolet light is suboptimal for decontamination of soft surfaces. 3 There is an urgent need for simple and widely available methods to decontaminate PPE, including cloth masks.",

This method has the advantage of being widely available and easy to use, particularly for cloth face masks. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of steam treatment applied via a rice cooker-steamer versus similar levels of dry heat for decontamination of cloth and surgical face masks and N95 respirators.",

The test organisms included a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA virus bacteriophage MS2 which was prepared as previously 2 described. 3 The test protocol has been reported previously. 3 In brief, 10-\u03bcL aliquots containing 10 6 colony-forming units (CFU) or plaque-forming units (PFU) of the test organisms suspended in 8% simulated mucus were inoculated onto 1-cm 2 areas on both the outer or inner surfaces of the respirators or face masks. 3 The inoculated masks or respirators were subjected to a cycle of treatment in a steamer (Aroma; San Diego, CA) lasting approximately 13-15 minutes, including 8-10 minutes of heating and 5 minutes of steam. For comparison, inoculated masks or respirators were subjected to dry heat at 100\u00b0C for 15 minutes in an oven (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA). After treatment, the inoculated sections of the face masks and N95 respirators were vortexed for 1 minute in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02% Tween and serial dilutions were plated on selective media to quantify viable organisms. 3 All tests were performed in triplicate. Log 10 reductions were calculated in comparison to untreated controls. A reduction of 3-log10 or greater in recovery of organisms inoculated onto masks or respirators was considered effective for decontamination. 3 As shown in Figure 1 , the steam treatment resulted in a greater than 5 log 10 reduction in bacteriophage MS2 and MRSA applied to the outer and inner surfaces of the face masks and respirators, whereas dry heat at 100\u00b0C for 15 minutes did not result in a greater than 3 log 10 reduction of either organism at any of the inoculated sites on any masks or respirators. No visible changes were observed in any of the masks or respirators after 5 cycles of decontamination.",

Dry heat at the same temperature levels was much less effective, consistent with previous evidence that moist heat or microwave-generated steam is more effective than dry 2 heat for inactivation of viruses. [4] [5] Notably, the short cycle of steam treatment was substantially more effective than ultraviolet light treatment for N95 decontamination and nearly as effective as aerosolized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. 3 The major limitation of our study is that we did not examine the effect of treatment on respirator or face mask performance. However, there is some evidence that short cycles of steam treatment may have minimal effect on filtration and fit performance. 2 Further testing is needed to evaluate the impact of steam treatment on performance of N95 respirators and surgical face masks.",
