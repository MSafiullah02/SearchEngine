Previous CoV epidemics include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, which started in China in 2002 [2], and the ongoing Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in the Middle East, first reported in 2012 [3]. Those epidemics all began with animal-to-human infection. The direct cause of death is generally due to ensuing severe atypical pneumonia [4,5]. ",

Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin through the action of UVB radiation reaching 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin, followed by a thermal reaction. That vitamin D3 or oral vitamin D is converted to 25(OH)D in the liver and then to the hormonal metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol), in the kidneys or other organs as needed. Most of vitamin D\u2019s effect arises from calcitriol entering the nuclear vitamin D receptor, a DNA binding protein that interacts directly with regulatory sequences near target genes and that recruits chromatin active complexes that participate genetically and epigenetically in modifying transcriptional output [8]. A well-known function of calcitriol is to help regulate serum calcium concentrations, which it does in a feedback loop with parathyroid hormone (PTH), which itself has many important functions in the body [7].

Administering vitamin D reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages ([17] and references therein).",

Only two RCTs reported beneficial effects: one among schoolchildren in Japan [52], the other among infants in China [53]. An RCT in Japan that reported no beneficial effect did not measure baseline 25(OH)D concentration [54] and included many participants who had been vaccinated against influenza (M.

Most of the beneficial effects of vitamin D given in Table 2 are from observational studies of disease incidence or prevalence with respect to serum 25(OH)D concentrations. RCTs comparing outcomes for participants treated or given a placebo are preferred to establish causality related to health outcomes. However, most vitamin D RCTs have not reported that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of disease [62,63]. Reasons for the lack of agreement between observational studies and RCTs seems to be due to several factors, including enrolling participants with relatively high 25(OH)D concentrations and using low vitamin D doses and not measuring baseline and achieved 25(OH)D concentrations. Previous studies proposed that RCTs of nutrients such as vitamin D be based on nutrient status, such as 25(OH)D concentration, seeking to enroll participants with low values, supplementing them with enough agent to raise the concentration to values associated with good health, and measuring achieved concentrations as well as cofactors such as vitamin C, omega-3 fatty acids, and magnesium [64,65],. Two recently completed RCTs reported significantly reduced incidence in the secondary analyses for cancer [66] and diabetes mellitus [67].",

The U.S. Public Health Service conducted door-to-door surveys of 12 communities from New Haven, Connecticut, to San Francisco, California, to ascertain incidence and CFRs. The canvasses were made as soon as possible after the autumn 1918 wave of the epidemic subsided in each locality. A total of 146,203 people, 42,920 cases, and 730 deaths were found. As shown in their Table 25, fatality rates averaged 1.70 per 100 influenza cases but averaged 25.5 per 100 cases of pneumonia. The percentage of influenza complicated by pneumonia was 6.8%. The pneumonia CFR (excluding Charles County, MD, because of inconsistencies in recording cause of death) was 28.8 per 100 for whites and 39.8 per 100 for \u201ccoloreds\u201d. As shown in Table 23, \u201ccoloreds\u201d in the southeastern states had between a 27% and 80% higher rate of pneumonia compared to whites. As discussed in an ecological study using those CFR data, communities in the southwest had lower CFR than those in the northeast because of higher summertime and wintertime solar UVB doses [121]. Previous work suggested that higher UVB doses were associated with higher 25(OH)D concentrations, leading to reductions in the cytokine storm and the killing of bacteria and viruses that participate in pneumonia. African Americans had much higher mortality rates than white Americans for the period 1900\u20131948 [122]. The reasons CFRs were higher for \u201ccoloreds\u201d than whites may include that they have higher rates of chronic diseases, are more likely to live in regions impacted by air pollution, and that with darker skin pigmentation, blacks have lower 25(OH)D concentrations. A clinical trial involving postmenopausal women living on Long Island, NY with mean baseline 25(OH)D concentration 19 \u00b1 8 ng/mL found that supplementation with 2000 IU/d resulted in significantly fewer upper respiratory tract infections, including influenza, than a placebo or supplementation with 800 IU/d [123]. See, also, references in [11]. An analysis of serum 25(OH)D concentrations by race for 2001\u20132004 indicated mean 25(OH)D concentrations for people over 40 years: non-Hispanic whites, ~25\u201326 ng/mL; non-Hispanic blacks, 14\u201317 ng/mL; Mexican\u2013Americans, 18\u201322 ng/mL [124]. A reason proposed for the higher mortality rates in some communities during the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic was that they were near to coal-fired electricity generating plants [125]. Recent studies have confirmed that air pollution, from combustion sources, increases the risk of influenza [126,127]. The highest concentration of these plants is in the northeast, where solar UVB doses are lowest.",

            "text": "The data reviewed here supports the role of higher 25(OH)D concentrations in reducing risk of infection and death from ARTIs, including those from influenza, CoV, and pneumonia. The peak season for ARTIs is generally when 25(OH)D concentrations are lowest. Thus, vitamin D3 supplementation should be started or increased several months before winter to raise 25(OH)D concentrations to the range necessary to prevent ARTIs. Studies reviewed here generally reported that 25(OH)D concentrations of 20\u201330 ng/mL reduced the risk of ARTIs [134]. One reason for that result may be that the studies included few participants with higher 25(OH)D concentrations. However, one observational study reported that 38 ng/mL was the appropriate concentration to reduce the risk of CAP [57]. Although the degree of protection generally increases as 25(OH)D concentration increases, the optimal range appears to be in the range of 40\u201360 ng/mL (100\u2013150 nmol/l). To achieve those levels, approximately half the population could take at least 2000\u20135000 IU/d of vitamin D3 [135]. Various loading doses have been studied for achieving a 25(OH)D concentration of 30 ng/mL. For example, one study used a weekly or fortnightly dose totaling 100,000\u2013200,000 IU over 8 weeks (1800 or 3600 IU/d) [136]. However, to achieve 40\u201360 ng/mL would take higher loading doses. A trial involving Canadian breast cancer patients with bone metastases treated with bisphosphonates but without comorbid conditions reported that doses of 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 over a four-month period showed no adverse effects, but did unmask two cases of primary hyperparathyroidism [137]. A study involving 33 participants, including seven taking 4000 IU/d of vitamin D3 and six who took 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 for 8 weeks, reported that 25(OH)D concentrations increased from 20 \u00b1 6 to 39 \u00b1 9 for 4000 IU/d and from 19 \u00b1 4 to 67 \u00b1 3 for 10,000 IU/d and improved gut microbiota with no adverse effects [138]. Thus, from the literature, it is reasonable to suggest taking 10,000 IU/d for a month, which is effective in rapidly increasing circulating levels of 25(OH)D into the preferred range of 40\u201360 ng/mL. To maintain that level after that first month, the dose can be decreased to 5000 IU/d [135,139,140]. When high doses of vitamin D are taken, calcium supplementation should not be high to reduce risk of hypercalcemia.",

Half of the patients were black, and nearly half were white. All patients entering since 2011 were offered supplementation of 5000 or 10,000 IU/d vitamin D3. For 36 patients who received 5000 IU/d for 12 months or longer, mean serum 25(OH)D concentration rose from 24 to 68 ng/mL, whereas for the 78 patients who received 10,000 IU/d, mean concentrations increased from 25 to 96 ng/mL. No cases of vitamin D\u2013induced hypercalcemia were reported. This article includes a brief review of other high-dose vitamin D studies, including the fact that vitamin D doses of 60,000\u2013600,000 IU/d were found to treat and control such diseases as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, rickets, and tuberculosis in the 1930s and 1940s. Those doses are much higher than the 10,000\u201325,000 IU/d of vitamin D3 that can be made from solar UVB exposure [142]. However, after reports of hypercalcemia associated with use of supra-physiological doses of vitamin D surfaced, e.g., [143], high-dose vitamin D supplementation fell out of favor.",

That recommendation was based on the effects of vitamin D for bone health. The institute recognized that no studies had reported adverse effects of supplementation with less than 10,000 IU/d of vitamin D, but set the upper intake level at 4000 IU/d, partly out of concerns stemming from observational studies that found U-shaped 25(OH)D concentration\u2013health outcome relationships. However, later investigation determined that most reports of J- or U-shaped relationships were from observational studies that did not measure serum 25(OH)D concentrations and that the likely reason for those relationships was a result of enrolling some participants who had started taking vitamin D supplements shortly before enrolling [151].",

In addition, increases in 25(OH)D concentration with respect to vitamin D supplementation depend on various personal factors, including genetics, digestive system health, weight, and baseline 25(OH)D concentration.
