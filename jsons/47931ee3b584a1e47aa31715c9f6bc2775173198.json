Therefore, although the number of fatal COVID-19 positive patients treated with ACEIs was more than twice the number of those treated with ARBs, one cannot definitely conclude risks or benefits of these therapies due to confounding variables of age, HTN, as well as the impact of yet unidentified comorbidities on outcome with the COVID-19 pandemic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mayo Clinic Proceedings"}, {"text": "In a recent study, in which potential drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated, the authors reported that ARBs (e.g., irbesartan) may associate with some human coronaviruses-associated host proteins in the human interactome. 34 Irbesartan targets the SLC10A1 gene (solute carrier family 10 member 1), which interacts with C11orf74 gene, a potential transcriptional repressor that interacts with the non-structural protein 10 (NSP10) of SARS-CoV and participates in CoV replication fidelity. 35 Crackower and co-workers 36 reported that disruption of ACE2 results in increased Ang II levels and impaired cardiac function, whereas other authors showed that ACE2 overexpression reduced left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis in HTN rats. 37 Deshotels et al. 50 investigated the compensatory reduction of ACE2 expression and activity in response to Ang II-mediated HTN. Elevated levels of Ang II decreased ACE2 activity on the cell surface via an AT 1 Rdependent internalization mechanism. 50 Moreover, in vitro treatment of HEK293T cells with Ang II enhanced ACE2 ubiquitination also mediated by AT 1 R, which ultimately stimulates ACE2 lysosomal degradation (which might prevent interaction of the SARS-Co-V2 with ACE2 catalytic site). 50 This is reported to be prevented by AT 1 R antagonist losartan which may block internalization, proteolytic degradation and ubiquitination of ACE2. 50 As such, this latter pathway represents another mechanism by which ACEIs or ARBs could prevent COVID-19 viral entry. If the viral protein interaction with ACE2 is reduced in the presence of stabilized ACE2-AT 1 R complexes, then ARBs could prove beneficial by stabilizing ACE2-AT 1 R interaction and preventing viral protein-ACE2 interaction and internalization. Based on this mechanism of action, Gurwitz recently suggests ARBs (losartan and telmisartan) as a tentative therapy for COVID-19 patients prior to the development of ALI/acute respiratory failure. 51 However, it remains unknown whether preventing ACE2 internalization would be effective at attenuating infections by SARS coronaviruses, and further studies are urgently needed to clarify this mechanism.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 226, "end": 228, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 492, "end": 494, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 520, "end": 522, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 750, "end": 752, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 770, "end": 772, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1003, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1251, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1400, "end": 1402, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1963, "end": 1965, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Mayo Clinic Proceedings"}, {"text": "Interestingly, Liu et al. 52 reported serum Ang II levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 infected than non-infected individuals and linearly associated with viral load and lung damage.

The binding of coronavirus S protein to ACE2 triggers a conformational change in the S protein, allowing for proteolytic digestion by TMPRSS2, which enables viral and cell membrane fusion.21 This was recently confirmed by the evidence that camostat mesylate, a protease TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocks viral entry and may be a promising drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection.21,22 As ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, many healthcare professionals have begun to reconsider the safety and effects of anti-HTN therapy with ACEIs or ARBs in patients during the COVID-19 outbreak-; and, despite statements by medical organizations, they began to question whether patients with COVID-19 and HTN maintained on ACEIs or ARBs to decrease BP values (or for other conditions such as CVD and CKD) should change to another anti-HTN pharmacological agent.23 Such considerations contributed to the current controversy.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "morbidities.

Nevertheless, these numbers are preliminary and may not precisely reflect adjusted differences in risk. It is virtually impossible to precisely identify all medical therapies before admission from medical records 33 . Moreover, patients with elevated BP on admission may be noted to have a history of chronic HTN in their medical record, and such coding may reflect provider biases from the current infectious illness. The median age of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who died was 78.5 years (median: 80 years; range: 31-103 years; interquartile range, 73-85 years). Since HTN prevalence increases in parallel with aging, this pattern may represent the expected prevalence for the given age group. Therefore, although the number of fatal COVID-19 positive patients treated with ACEIs was more than twice the number of those treated with ARBs, one cannot definitely conclude risks or benefits of these therapies due to confounding variables of age, HTN, as well as the impact of yet unidentified comorbidities on outcome with the COVID-19 pandemic.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Lower cardiac ACE2 concentrations are observed in HTN, 37, 38 CVD associated with DM,39 and Ang II-induced cardiac dysfunction,40 suggesting that augmenting ACE2 could have beneficial therapeutic effects on the CV system.

Whether RAAS modulation may have a beneficial effect in selected patients with severe COVID-19 at risk for ALI/ARDS is entirely unknown at the present time. Moreover, the effects of other agents that may interrupt the RAAS by inhibiting renin, such as renin inhibitors and beta-blockers, would also be of interest regarding their effects on COVID-19 and attendant ALI.In agreement with current guidelines, patients with HTN should continue taking anti-HTN medications as prescribed without interruption. Current evidence shows that RAAS inhibitors, i.e., ACEIs and ARBs, significantly reduce mortality in CVD, reduce the progression of CKD, and are the cornerstone of HF and HTN treatment. ACEIs or ARBs therapy should be maintained or initiated, as indicated, in patients with HF, HTN, or myocardial infarction, regardless of SARS-CoV-2. No differences exist between ARBs and ACEIs in terms of efficacy to decrease BP and improve other outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, myocardial infarction, HF, stroke, and end-stage renal disease. 58 ACEIs are associated with cough secondary to accumulation of bradykinin and angioedema, while withdrawal rates due to adverse events are lower with ARBs. 58 Given the equal efficacy but fewer adverse events, ARBs could potentially be a more favorable treatment option in COVID-19 patients at higher risk of developing severe forms of disease(Table 2). To further evaluate the role of RAAS modulation in COVID-19, datasets should be analyzed to investigate if use of ACEIs and ARBs on admission could be associated with ALI/ARDS and/or survival/mortality in patients with DM, HTN and CVD.46.
