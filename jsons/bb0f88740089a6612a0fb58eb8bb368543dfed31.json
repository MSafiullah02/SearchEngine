The molecular mechanism of SARS pathogenesis remains elusive. Inflammatory stimuli can activate IkB kinase (IKK) signalsome and subsequently the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), which influences gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) along with other transcription factors. In this work, we found that the membrane (M) protein of SARS-CoV physically interacted with IKKb using a coimmunoprecipitation assay (IPA). Expression of M suppressed tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) induced NF-kB activation using a luciferase reporter assay. Further investigation showed M protein suppressed Cox-2 expression using a luciferase reporter gene assay, RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The carboxyl terminal of M protein was sufficient for the M protein function. Together, these results indicate that SARS-CoV M suppresses NF-kB activity probably through a direct interaction with IKKb, resulting in lower Cox-2 expression. Suppression of NF-kB activity and Cox-2 expression may contribute to SARS pathogenesis.",

Morbidity and mortality rate is up to 10% in the SARS-CoV infected patients [Lee et al., 2003] . The SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome comprising approximately 29,727 nucleotides predicted to contain 14 open reading frames (ORFs). A sequence comparison with corresponding ORFs of other known coronaviruses has revealed a pattern of gene organization similar to typical coronaviruses.",

For other coronaviruses, the M protein is a key player in the assembly of virions at intracellular Ms between endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex. The SARS-CoV M protein can interact with nucleocapsid (N) protein in vitro and in vivo [He et al., 2004; Fang et al., 2005] .

            "text": "Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) transcription factors, as a homo-or heterodimer of c-Rel, RelA (p65), RelB, p50, and p52, play an important role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. Inactivated NF-kB resides in the cytoplasm by forming complexes with IkB [Ghosh et al., 1998] . Proinflammatory stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induce signal cascades through their cognate receptors, TNFR and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), to activate IkB kinase (IKK) signalsome and subsequently NF-kB, which plays an essential role in innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens [Kontgen et al., 1995; Caamano and Hunter, 2002] . IKK signalsome is composed of at least two kinases, IKKa and IKKb, and a regulatory factor, IKKg. Among these proteins, IKKb is known as a major kinase and IKKg is required for the full activation of IKKb upon proinflammatory stimulation [Li et al., 1999; Rudolph et al., 2000; Sadikot et al., 2003] . Activated IKK signalsome phosphorylates IkB, which subsequently undergoes ubiquitination and degradation, exposing nuclear localization signal to allow NF-kB translocate into the nucleus, which, in turn, activates target genes [Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000 ], such as Cox-2, along with other transcription factors, including cyclic-AMP response element (CRE) and CCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) [Hwang et al., 1997; Caivano et al., 2001] . Accordingly, proinflammatory stimuli induce the expression of Cox-2 to catalyze the production of prostaglandins, which promote inflammation through a variety of mechanisms.",

To evade host immune responses, some viruses have evolved strategies to interfere with NF-kB activation. For example, vaccinia virus encodes a viral homolog of the scaffolding protein MyD88, which is involved in IL-1mediated activation of NF-kB. The viral protein A52R acts as a dominant-negative form of MyD88, abrogating IL-1-mediated signaling, which is important for resistance to vaccinia virus [Bowie et al., 2000] . Cowpox, racoonpox, and some strains of vaccinia viruses were found to inhibit NF-kB activation by interfering with IkBa degradation [Oie and Pickup, 2001] . The African swine fever virus (ASFV) A238L protein, which is a homolog of IkB and contains ankyrin repeats that bind to NF-kB dimers, prevents NF-kB nuclear translocation [Revilla et al., 1998 ]. HIV accessory protein Vpu has been shown to inhibit NF-kB activation by interfering with b-TrCP-mediated degradation of IkBa and to promote apoptosis of the infected cells by suppressing NF-dependent expression of anti-apoptotic factors Bour et al., 2001] . In this study we demonstrated that the M protein can interact with IKKb and suppress the activation of NF-kB.",

            "text": "NF-kB along with other transcription factors regulates expression of Cox-2. Involvement of NF-kB in COX-2 expression is well documented in a variety of cell types [D'Acquisto et al., 1997; Caivano et al., 2001] . Along with constitutively expressed COX-1, COX-2 metabolizes arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, which is further metabolized to generate various prostanoids [FitzGerald, 2003 ]. Prostanoids are considered to promote inflammation by inducing vasodilation and increasing vascular permeability and cellular migration to the site of inflammation [Williams and Shacter, 1997; Dubois et al., 1998 ]. COX-2 protein plays a significant role in host immune response, in which its production is linked to exposure to catalase and peptidoglycan [Chen et al., 2004; Jang et al., 2004] . COX-2 has also specifically been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of some viral infections [Steer and Corbett, 2003] , notable examples being the dependence on COX-2 for replication of cytomegalovirus [Zhu et al., 2002] and the induction of COX-2 by primary human herpesvirus 6 infection [Janelle et al., 2002] . However, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a herpesvirus that establishes latency in white blood cells, has been shown to inhibit both COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 in monocytes [Savard et al., 2000] . Similar to EBV, SARS-CoV M protein mediated Cox-2 downregulation may be beneficial to virus replication by limiting inflammatory responses.",

It has been postulated recently that the N protein of SARS-CoV activates the expression of Cox-2 by binding directly to regulatory elements for NF-kB and CEBP [Yan et al., 2006] . Our studies have shown that SARS-CoV M protein suppresses NF-kB activation and COX-2 expression. That the SARS-CoV M protein suppresses NF-kB activation may be a strategy used by the virus to control the host cells to J. Med. Virol. DOI 10.1002/jmv Fig. 7 . The SARS-CoV M protein suppressed COX-2 protein expression in Vero E6 cells. A: Vero E6 cells were transfected with different amounts of pcDNA3.1(-)-M. RNA from the cells were purified and used for RT-PCR with Cox-2 specific primers. The RT-PCR products were resolved in agarose gel. GAPDH was used as a control. B: Western blot analysis of the expression of COX-2 protein. Vero E6 cells were transfected with empty vector pcDNA3.1(-) as a control (lane 1) or with plasmid pcDNA3.1(-)-M, expressing SARS-CoV M protein (lane 2). Cell extracts were prepared and the expression levels of Cox-2 proteins were determined using Western blot with rabbit anti-COX-2 antibody. Fig. 8 . The C-terminal of the SARS-CoV M protein was sufficient for the M protein mediated NF-kB or COX-2 downregulation. Vero E6 cells were transfected with 0.2 mg of reporter plasmids (pNF-kB-Luc or pGL3 COX-2-Luc) and 0.6 mg of pcDNA3.1(-)-M or pcDNA3.1(-)-M90. Cells transfected with the reporter plasmids and the pcDNA3.1(-) vector were used as negative controls. Cells were harvested 24 hr after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activities correspond to an average of at least three independent experiments done in duplicate, and values are means AE SEM. *P < 0.01 (significantly different from the control). facilitate the virus survival and replication. It was proposed that in early stage of viral infection, SARS-CoV evades protective immunity to their advantage. At a late stage of infection, SARS-CoV replicates at a high level and progeny viruses are released from host cells, SARS-CoV activates NF-kB and upregulates COX-2 expression, then triggering antiviral activities of prostanoids. SARS sequelae, such as transendothelial migration of polymorphonuclear cells into the lung tissues, multiple organ dysfunction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, have been postulated to be associated with cytokine and chemokine dysregulation.",
