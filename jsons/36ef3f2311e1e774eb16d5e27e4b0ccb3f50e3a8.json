We have learned new lessons of survival, adaptation, and evolution from viewing the natural history of genomes in hundreds of detailed studies. A single case history of one species, the African cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus, is here reviewed to reveal a long-term story of conservation challenges and action informed by genetic discoveries and insights.

When breeding was attempted in zoos in the 1950-1980 period, cheetahs were unusual in that they bred poorly in captivity, rarely exceeding 15% success of attempted pairing. Even so, cub mortality was 30-40% higher than almost all zoo animals leading to a captive population that was hardly sustainable (Marker and O'Brien 1989; O'Brien et al. 1985) . Cheetah males displayed a 10-fold reduction in sperm count plus an elevated incidence of malformed spermatozoa (~70-75% of sperm in any males had super large heads, tiny heads, coiled or bent tails, indicators of sterility in other Felidae species) (O'Brien et al. 1983 (O'Brien et al. , 1985 Wildt et al. 1993; Crosier et al. 2007 ). Part of the reason for the reproductive impairments was likely the relative paucity of overall genome variability in cheetahs sampled from zoos and in wild populations from southern and eastern Africa. Cheetahs displayed 90-99% less overall diversity than other cats and most other mammals based upon early surveys of nuclear allozymes, 2DE skin fibroblast proteins, and RFLP diversity in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (O'Brien et al. 1983 (O'Brien et al. , 1985 Yuhki et al. 1990; O'Brien and Johnson 2005) . Perhaps the most remarkable indicator of the cheetah's genetic impoverishment was the demonstration that cheetahs failed to reject surgically implanted skin allografts from unrelated cheetah donors, while their perfectly functional immune system adequately rejected xenograft skin patches from the domestic cat (O'Brien et al. 1985) . The cheetah's MHC, which mediates graft rejection in most species was so similar that their immune system failed to recognize \"nonself,\" as if the cheetahs tested were immunological clones or identical twins. It seemed as though the ancestors of modern cheetahs had offloaded most of their endemic genetic variability, leaving a species dramatically reduced in genetic diversity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 152, "end": 163, "text": "(Neff 1983;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 164, "end": 190, "text": "Marker and Eszterhas 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 495, "end": 520, "text": "(Marker and O'Brien 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 521, "end": 541, "text": "O'Brien et al. 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 793, "end": 813, "text": "(O'Brien et al. 1983", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 814, "end": 836, "text": "(O'Brien et al. , 1985", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 837, "end": 855, "text": "Wildt et al. 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 856, "end": 875, "text": "Crosier et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1331, "text": "(O'Brien et al. 1983", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1354, "text": "(O'Brien et al. , 1985", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1373, "text": "Yuhki et al. 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1399, "text": "O'Brien and Johnson 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1734, "text": "(O'Brien et al. 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Reconstitution of allelic variation in rapidly mutating genetic markers (nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA which evolve 10-100 times faster than other chromosomal sequences) provided an innate chronometer that predicted the time elapsed since the population bottleneck which reduced the species' genetic legacy.

Cheetah populations were widespread until this time, when a large mammal extinction event eliminated 75% of large mammals from North America, including mastodons, mammoths, giant ground sloth, short faced bears, saber toothed tiger, American lions, pumas, and cheetahs (Neff 1983; Gingerich 1984; Werdelin 1985; Martin and Wright 1967; Werdelin et al. 2009 ). Thankfully for the cheetah, many thousands of years earlier their forebears had migrated from North America across the Beringia straits to Asia (these exact geographic movements are controversial; O'Brien et al. 2016; Faurby et al. 2016) and dispersed southward to colonize Africa.

FeCV causes feline infectious peritonitis in house cats, a progressive deadly pathology whereby the immune system produces virus-immunoglobulin deposits as a milky fluid in the peritoneum which strangulates kidneys, liver and internal organs. FeCV morbidity is usually less than 10% and mortality approximately 1% in domestic cat facilities or multi-cat households. The cheetah contagion was much worse. Within 6 months every cheetah at the breeding facility (45 individuals) was infected, all had symptoms (fever, diarrhea, twitches, seizers, and collapse) and within 3 years 60% of the cheetahs had died. This remains the worst case of FCoV infection ever reported in any species.

The initial genome analyses unraveled a plethora of fascinating insights around the cheetah's past and also its remarkable specialization for dazzling speed. Multiple features of the cheetah's genome were detailed and annotated in depth: 20 343 protein-coding genes, the wide complexity of repetitive DNA families, noncoding RNA families, DNA variation within and outside of genes, copy number variation, and genes that showed evidence of recent selective pressures. The cheetah's incredible specialization for running is likely influenced by selective retention of gene variants related to energetics and anabolism for producing muscle specialization. The genome analyses identified a group of 11 candidate genes that display evidence of selection involved in muscle contraction (5 genes), stress response (2 genes), and regulation of catabolic processes (4 genes), all now putative candidates for the cascade of sprinting adaptations we see in modern cheetahs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 189, "text": "Dobrynin et al.

Further mining of Chewbacca's genome revealed a plausible explanation for the cheetahs' ability to accept allogeneic skin grafts. Several genes that mediate graft rejection, the MHC (perhaps the most variable gene family in human and other mammal genomes) are nearly monomorphic across different cheetahs.

One marked consequence of these bottlenecks and subsequent consanguineous matings is reproductive impairments including elevated incidence of malformed spermatozoa (O'Brien et al. 1983; Wildt et al. 1993; Crosier et al. 2007 ). The cheetah genome analyses revealed that AKAP4, a testisexpressed gene known to regulate sperm development in humans and mice, showed a remarkable signatures of selection due to 10 fixed substitutions in coding regions, 5 of which are function altering and likely compromise normal sperm development in the entire species (Dobrynin et al. 2015) .

They also presented an analyses of 20 microsatellite loci for 92 cheetah specimens. Results of their phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA were in effect remarkably similar to ours.

Southern and northeast African cheetah populations showed modest molecular genetic distances in comparison with Iranian cheetahs, similar to the distances among African population isolates. Their results affirm the distinction of Asian to African cheetah populations but also their shallow divergence, lending additional support to the interpretation that like African populations, Asiatic cheetahs derive from a post-bottleneck expansion. Charruau et al. (2011) also presented data on a museum specimen of extinct Indian cheetah showing it to align rather closely with the Iranian cheetah lineage. This result supports other evidence of a common Asian origin for Indian and Iranian cheetahs and discounts a previously unsettled postulate that the Iranian cheetahs are possibly descendants of African cheetahs that were re-located and released by Middle Eastern sheiks in historic times.
