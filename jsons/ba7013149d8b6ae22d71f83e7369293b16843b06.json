Expression Of Proteins In Plants, Wo/2006/119516. (a) Zinc finger nuclease technology 1: Genes encoding for Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFN) are delivered to plant cells without a repair template. The ZFN binds to the DNA and generates a site-specific double strand break (DSB). The natural DNA-repair process through non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) leads to site-specific random mutations, which consist of changes of single or few base pairs, short deletions or insertions. (b) Zinc finger nuclease technology 2: Genes encoding for Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFN) are delivered to plant cells along with a short repair template. The ZFN binds to the DNA and generates a site-specific double strand break (DSB). Gene repair mechanisms generate site-specific point mutations like changes of single or few base pairs through homologous recombination.(c) Zinc finger nuclease technology 3: Genes encoding for Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFN) are delivered to plant cells along with a large stretch of DNA, whose ends are homologous to the DNA sequences flanking the cleavage site. As a result, the DNA stretch is site-specifically inserted into the plant genome.(d) Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis:Also known as Targeted Gene Repair, Oligonucleotide-directed Gene Targeting, Genoplasty, Chimeraplasty, etc. Oligonucleotides target homologous DNA and induce site-specific nucleotide substitutions, insertions or deletions through repair mechanisms. The following types of oligonucleotides are used: Single stranded DNA oligonucleotides, chimeric oligonucleotides, triple helix-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) and RNA oligonucleotides.",
