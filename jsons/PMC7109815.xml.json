From 8 March to 3 May 2003, 7 patients with illnesses that met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition (1 May 2003) of probable SARS [31 ] were identified and treated at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) in Taipei. Serum samples from the 7 patients were sent to the hospital's Department of Laboratory Medicine for routine serologic and biochemical analysis. The laboratory diagnostic test, clinical manifestations of illness, and treatment of these patients have been described in detail in our recently published report [31 ]. Serum samples were collected from patients with SARS and were tested by use of the following methods [31 ]: virus isolation in Vero E6 cells (American Type Culture Collection), serotype-specific reversetranscriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [16 ], and a standard indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay for the detection of antibody to SARS-CoV [19 ]. All 7 patients with SARS were positive for SARS RNA by RT-PCR, and 6 of them were positive for SARS antibody by IFA assay (patient SP7 was seronegative) [31 ]. Although the patients had received ribavirin, corticosteroid, and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment during the early stage of the disease, the antibody was detected by IFA assay as early as 10\u201312 days after onset of illness [31 ]. Written informed consent was obtained from all volunteers. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the College of Medicine, National Taiwan University (Taipei), and the human experimentation guidelines of the US Department of Health and Human Services were followed in the conduct of this research.",

To enhance selection of peptides binding to IgG specifically associated with patients with SARS, we designed a preclearing step to remove nonspecific clones by preabsorption of the phage-displayed 12-mer peptide library (4\u00d71010 phage particles; New England BioLabs) onto purified IgG from normal serum pooled from 5 control subjects (SARS-CoV seronegative by IFA assay) who were blood donors. Next, the precleared phage library was selected onto IgG purified from the serum of patients with SARS. Affinity selection on immobilized IgG from the serum of patients with SARS, for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, was used for screening. Unbound phage particles were removed, and magnetic beads were washed extensively with PBST0.5 (PBS plus 0.5% [wt/vol] Tween-20). Bound phage particles were eluted with glycine buffer (pH 2.2), neutralized with Tris buffer (pH 9.1), and amplified for subsequent rounds of selection. Three rounds of selection were performed for each patient. The biopanning protocol for the second and third rounds was identical to that of the first round, with the addition of 2\u00d71011 pfu of phage particles for biopanning. Titration of unamplified third-round phage eluate was done on Luria broth/isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactoside/5- bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-D-galactoside plates (Falcon; Becton Dickinson). Remaining eluate was stored at 4\u00b0C.",

Patient SP1, the first documented case patient with SARS in Taiwan, developed a febrile illness and was admitted to NTUH on 8 March 2003. During the patient's convalescence, serum samples were collected on 8 April 2003, to study diseasespecific epitopes of SARS. Selection of immunopositive phage clones by SARS-specific serum antibodies was done by immobilization on protein G magnetic beads; the bound phage clones were selected after biopanning. To enhance selection of peptides binding to IgG specifically associated with patients with SARS, we designed a preclearing and selection procedure (see Materials and Methods). The strategy for identification of SARS-specific epitopes is shown in figure 1A. A marked enrichment (log10 scale) of as much as 14,000-fold followed the third round of selection, compared with the first round of selection (figure 1B). Individual phage clones from the third round of biopanning were randomly selected. ELISA was performed to determine whether antibodies present in serum samples from patient SP1 were specifically recognized by selected phage clones derived from biopanning. Of 72 selected phage clones, 49 had significant enhancement of binding activity to SARS-specific serum antibodies (figure 2A). These clones did not bind to normal human serum (figure 2B).",

None of these phage clones reacted with serum samples from the 4 healthy control subjects (figure 3B).",

Selected phage-displayed peptide sequences had 2 consensus motifs, Pro-Pro-Asn and Val-Lys-Ile- X-Asn, which corresponded to amino acid residues 1184\u20131186 of CDS2 (PPN) and 18\u201322 of CDS4 (VKIDN) in SARS-CoV, respectively.

From the study of antibody kinetics (figure 7), we found that the peptides were able to detect patient serum samples during the convalescent phase of SARS but not during the acute phase. Peptide-binding and competitive-inhibition assay showed that synthetic peptide SP3M corresponded to amino acid residues 18\u201327 of CDS4 of SARS-CoV, further confirming that patients with SARS generated antibodies against SARS-CoV (figure 4). To further confirm that epitope-based synthetic peptides generated antibodies against SARS-CoV, we generated antibodies against peptides MSP1-1 and SP3M. Both MSP1-1- and SP3M-immunized serum samples were found, by IFA, to generate antibodies that recognized SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells (figure 5), further proving that the phage-displayed epitope was immunogenic to SARS-CoV. We also studied the neutralizing activity of these antibodies (using 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV). The neutralizing activity of patient SP1 antiserum was \u2a7e1:60. No notable neutralization of SARS-CoV was observed in MSP1-1- and SP3M-immunized mouse serum samples.
