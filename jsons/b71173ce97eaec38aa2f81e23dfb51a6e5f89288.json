            "text": "24 spreading, major congress meetings have either been 25 cancelled or delayed, including urology meetings. The 26 2020 annual meeting of the European Association of 27 Urology due to be held in July has been postponed. The 28 annual meeting of the American Urological Association has 29 also been cancelled and will be replaced by a virtual 30 education symposium. Similarly, many other events at 31 national and regional levels have been cancelled. Such 32 drastic decisions were mandatory considering that the peak 33 of the COVID-19 spread has not yet been reached, and that 34 differences in epidemic curves among countries make 35 global organization difficult. Urologists worldwide are also 36 being asked to reorganize their clinical activity to support 37 internists and anesthesiologists [1-3]. Moreover, giving the 38 high virulence of COVID-19, gathering thousands of 39 attendees in a single venue would be inappropriate [4,5]. 40 Despite the inevitability of these decisions, they have 41 significant consequences: (1) continuing medical education 42 has been disrupted; and (2) the economic damage to 43 scientific societies and industry partners appears to be 44 huge. In trying to solve these issues and overcome the well-45 established format for traditional meeting, the possibility of 46 organizing a virtual congress using online technology seems 47 to be attractive and safe. The new digital platforms now 48 available allow advanced virtual integration among users, 49 giving opportunities for exchange of remote information. 50 Interactive video and audio capabilities allow real-time 51 interaction. The advent of hyperefficient telecommunica-52 tion networks (satellite, 5 G) guarantees the transmission of 53 high-quality images offering an optimal visual experience, 54 with an image quality close to reality [6]. Moreover, these 55 technologies allow the creation of virtual communities in 56 which \"social-virtual\" events, at which participants meet to 57 discuss a common topic, can be organized. The most 58 modern tool for live distance learning is webinar technology 59 [7] (Fig. 1A). Attendees can potentially deliver the same 60 scientific contribution as at a live event without the need to 61 move from their workplace; industries can also add 62 commercial spots during online meetings. A completely 63 web-based event can be planned.

Human contact, affec-66 tions, and emotions are almost impossible to reproduce on 67 an online platform. Many formal and most informal 68 interactions among faculty, delegates, scientific societies, 69 and industries could be at risk, potentially reducing the 70 opportunities for networking. Moreover, the role of 71 the scientific societies themselves could also be jeopar-72 dized, considering the economic implications of such 73 reorganization. 74 Ideally, a union between people and technology should 75 be created.

Attendees can potentially deliver the same 60 scientific contribution as at a live event without the need to61 move from their workplace; industries can also add 62 commercial spots during online meetings. technological solution has much appeal, it also has some critical limitations. Human contact, affections, and emotions are almost impossible to reproduce on 67 an online platform. Many formal and most informal 68 interactions among faculty, delegates, scientific societies, 69 and industries could be at risk, potentially reducing the 70 opportunities for networking. Moreover, the role of 71 the scientific societies themselves could also be jeopar-72 dized, considering the economic implications of such 73 reorganization. 74 Ideally, a union between people and technology should 75 be created. All the unlimited potential of the digital world 76 should be gradually integrated into the real world, leading 77 to a \"hybrid\" event.

In the near future, scientific sessions could be a mix 84 between live and broadcasted events during which the 85 onsite faculty interact dynamically with online members. 86 All the scientific content of the meeting should be 87 transmitted online via real-time or delayed streaming to 88 allow attendees to choose the best time at which to view the 89 sessions. Some meetings already stream plenary session 90 lectures and selected smaller lectures, but this capability 91 could be expanded across the full meeting content. 92 Dedicated online platforms and apps for meeting exist 93 but could be greatly improved in terms of the interface and 94 capability to allow delegates to choose their preferred 95 sessions and explore exhibition areas. Poster \"walks\" could 96 be conducted virtually, and open Q&A sessions for poster 97 presenters could continue asynchronously throughout the 98 duration of the meeting (and beyond).
