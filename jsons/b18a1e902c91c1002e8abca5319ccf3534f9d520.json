            "text": "M a n u s c r i p t 2 The recent onset of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has raised concerns that people who smoke may be at a greater risk of harm from infection 1 given the impact of cigarettes on respiratory disease and immune function. 2 Similarly, there is concern that electronic cigarette use may increase harm from COVID-19, 1 though evidence is lacking. 3 While a systematic review concluded that cigarette smoking is likely associated with increased harm from COVID-19, 4 a meta-analysis did not. 5 However, as noted by Berlin and colleagues, 6 the meta-analysis was limited by small sample sizes, resulting in large confidence intervals. 5 Berlin and colleagues describe findings from case series of smoking and COVID-19 as well as research from a prior coronavirus epidemic (MERS-CoV) that appear to support the association between smoking and adverse outcomes from COVID-19. 6 Regardless of the evidence on smoking and COVID-19, individual harm perceptions related to the virus may be inducing changes in tobacco use behavior. We recently conducted a cross sectional web-based survey of dual tobacco cigarette (TC) and electronic cigarette (EC) users to assess how past quit attempts differed between products. We also assessed changes in TC and EC use and motivation to quit due to COVID-19. We recruited participants using Amazon Mechanical Turk, a web-based crowd-sourcing service. Eligible participants were \u226521 years of age, lived in the United States, reported current or past use of TCs and ECs containing nicotine on >50% of days over a period of 30 days, and had attempted to reduce or quit ECs at some point in their life. Of the 593 who screened, 366 (61.7%) were eligible and completed the survey on April 10, 2020.",

Participants reported a mean concern about COVID-19 of 7.9 (SD=2.7) for their own TC; 48.0% EC), and a quarter reporting increased access (23.9% TC; 24.8% EC) to these products. There were positive but weak correlations between perceived risk of harm from A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 COVID-19 due to TC or EC use and motivation to quit for both TCs (rs=0.18, p<.01) and ECs (rs=0.18, p<.01).

Though almost half reported no change, COVID-19 prompted about a quarter of respondents to reduce their TC and EC use, and more than a third to increase their motivation to quit. Greater perceived risk was associated with increased motivation to quit both products, and over 20% of respondents reported a quit attempt in order to reduce risk of harm from COVID-19. These findings are consistent with recent quitline data showing increases in phone and website registrations in March 2020 compared to March 2019. 7 Thus, decreasing risk of harm from the pandemic may be an important motivator for some dual users to quit. On the other hand, about 30% of respondents increased their use and about 15% decreased their motivation to quit. Given the association between negative affect and smoking, 8 one possibility is that some TC and EC users are responding to pandemic-induced stress by increasing their use.",

Changes in motivation to quit TCs and ECs due to COVID-19 were also similar and positively correlated (rs=0.48, p<.001): motivation to quit decreased in 16.2% for TCs and 14.2% for ECs, remained the same in 48.2% for TCs and 48.2% for ECs, and increased in 35.6% for TCs and 37.6% for ECs. Further, 22.9% reported an attempt to quit TCs and 21.2% ECs in order to reduce risk of harm from COVID-19. Changes in use of TCs and ECs were similar and positively correlated (rs=0.68, p<.001): 28.3% (TC) and 24.9% (EC) decreased use, 41.4% (TC) and 46.0% (EC) remained the same, and 30.3% (TC) and 29.1% (EC) increased their use since learning of COVID-19. Access to TCs and ECs following COVID-19 was also similar and positively correlated (rs=0.65; p<.001) with approximately a quarter reporting decreased access (23.6% TC; 27.1% EC), half reporting no change (52.5%",
