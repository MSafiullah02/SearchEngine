The data obtained indicated a trend that the expression level of this gene cluster first decreased in stage I-III.The lowest expression level appeared in stage II (miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a/19b, and miR-20a) and stage III (miR-92a-1). Then, in stage IV, the expression levels of all 6 miRNAs rose to varying degrees. Among them, miR-17 and miR-20a increased sharply. We speculate that in stage I-III, the expression of the 6 miRNAs is inhibited to different degrees. In stage IV, such inhibitions are relieved. The unusually high expression of this gene cluster in stage IV may also indicate that this gene cluster is associated with tumor metastasis, since stage IV patients often have distant metastasis. However, this hypothesis requires further research.",
