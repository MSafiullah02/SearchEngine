Estimates of this rate fall between 0.4 and 1.1 nucleotide errors per genome per round of replication (excluding some outlying retroviruses, which we discuss later) [1]. These mutation rates affect every aspect of virus biology and are at least a hundred-fold higher than those estimated for DNA viruses and other DNA microbes [1]. The difference in rates appears to result from the lack of proofreading by the RNA-dependent polymerases of RNA viruses [2]: the DNA-dependent replicative polymerases of many other organisms have similar misincorporation rates, on the order of 10\u22124 to 10\u22125 per base per round of replication, but the error rate is then reduced to 10\u22125 to 10\u22127 by subsequent proofreading [3].",

We suggest that the most likely cause, and one that is amenable to further empirical study, is a trade-off between replication fidelity and replication speed. An important consequence, which is now exploited therapeutically, is that RNA viruses might be particularly susceptible to further elevation of their mutation rate; however, we argue that explanations for this involving a so-called error threshold might be misleading. The high mutation rate of RNA viruses affects their importance as human pathogens: it can facilitate rapid escape from adaptive immune responses and from drug treatment. However, a less-studied consequence is that high mutation rates are likely to constrain viral evolutionary change. Understanding the nature of this constraint, and perhaps more importantly what enables RNA viruses to occasionally escape it, will lead to valuable insights.",

Such mutations provide a striking exception to the general argument that, because most mutations are harmful, natural selection will cause the mutation rate to decrease to the point where it is balanced by the prohibitive metabolic cost of perfect replication fidelity [7].",

A low rate of mutation has been reported in the polymerase of yellow fever virus (a per genome rate of 0.002 [11], although this excludes lethal mutations, which, if included, could potentially increase the rate by a factor of two [12]). Furthermore, retroviruses have a broader range of rates than other RNA viruses (extending down to 0.06 mutations per genome per round of replication [13]). Perhaps more significantly, higher-fidelity RNA viral polymerases (which lead to a lower mutation rate) can be created in vitro. For example, repeated passage of poliovirus in the presence of the chemical mutagen ribavirin produced a mutant polymerase, differing by only one base, which showed higher replication fidelity than the wild type [14]. A ribavirin-resistant polymerase has also been selected for in FMDV [15]. Thus, RNA viruses can acquire a lower mutation rate, and it seems reasonable to assume that the option of reducing the mutation rate is open to natural populations, but is selected against.",

            "text": "Although the potentially therapeutic effect of elevating already high mutation rates might seem intuitive, there is not a good quantitative understanding of what is happening and why. Historically, the reasoning behind lethal mutagenesis appears to have emerged from population dynamic models in which the mutation rate is crucial \u2013 so-called quasispecies models 29, 30. Increasing the mutation (error) rate in these models causes unwelcome effects for the viral population. However, we believe that the common use of the term error threshold (or error catastrophe) to explain lethal mutagenesis therapy might be misleading. In Box 1\n, we show how the error threshold could be an artifact caused by unrealistic model assumptions and how lethal mutagenesis (that is, population extinction) can be explained solely in terms of viral growth and mutation rates. Bull et al.\n[25] recently presented a formal theory of this.Box 1A simple quasispecies modelConsider a viral population composed of a wild-type (i.e. fittest) sequence X and all its mutants Y. We model its growth as follows (Equations I and II; see online Supplementary Material for details).[Equation I]dxdt=\u03b1Qxt\u2212\u03b4xt\n[Equation II]dydt=\u03b1(1\u2212Q)xt+\u03b2yt\u2212\u03b4yt,where x\nt and y\nt are the population sizes of wild type and mutant at time t, respectively, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the replication rates of wild type and mutant, respectively (note, \u03b1 > \u03b2), \u03b4 is a uniform death rate and Q is the probability of error-free replication.We derive two thresholds involving Q.First, the fittest sequence is maintained only if Q > \u03b2/\u03b1. That is to say, the wild-type virus must be able to copy itself without error with a probability (Q) at least equal to its advantage in replication rate over that of the mutant (\u03b2/\u03b1). This is called the error threshold and a population that passes this threshold suffers an error catastrophe and loses its fittest sequence (the population also ceases to be centered upon the wild-type sequence and loses its consensus). In addition to being used to explain lethal mutagenesis, the error threshold offers an apparent explanation of why a typical RNA virus has a genome size of 104 bases and a mutation rate of 10\u22124 errors per base per round of replication [47]. We represent Q by the proportion of progeny that have no mutations in a Poisson distribution:[Equation III]Q=e\u2212mp,where p is the probability of mutation per base and m is the sequence length in bases.At the error threshold, Q = \u03b2/\u03b1. Thus,[Equation IV]\u03b2\u03b1=e\u2212mp.\nRewriting Equation IV, we get the following:[Equation V]m=ln\u03b1\u03b2p.\nGiven that the experimental data suggest that ln(\u03b1/\u03b2) \u2248 1 [12], the predicted maximum length of the virus is the inverse of its mutation rate, which is approximately what is observed.The error threshold is not biologically plausible, however. Our model assumes that (i) only the mutations that occur in the fittest sequence are deleterious and (ii) they are non-lethal (i.e. the virus has a fitness landscape as shown in Figure Ia). The empirical data for RNA viruses [12] suggest that their fitness landscape is more similar to that in Figure Ib, and several theoretical studies have shown that, if a more realistic fitness landscape is used, there is no error threshold (i.e. the fittest sequence always maintains itself) 46, 48, 49, 50.We argue that the possible absence of an error threshold is not important. If \u03b2 < \u03b4 (the mutants have a negative growth rate), the second threshold in our model, Q > \u03b4/\u03b1, determines whether the population as a whole survives. Here, the wild-type virus must be able to copy itself without error with a probability (Q) at least equal to the difference between its replication and death rates (\u03b4/\u03b1). Artificially increasing the mutation rate to reduce Q below this value will lead to extinction of the population (lethal mutagenesis). Alternatively, in the absence of \u03b4, extinction can be achieved by introducing additional mutant categories with growth rates below one into the model [29]. It is therefore not necessary to invoke an error threshold to explain either the small genomes of RNA viruses (as they get larger, Q will decrease in the absence of greater per base fidelity) or their sensitivity to artificially increased mutation rates (reducing Q directly).",

Mutation rate and genome size do in general appear to be inversely related, with the per base mutation rate of a range of DNA microbes varying such that their per genome mutation rate is approximately constant [1].

We have also found that RNA virus species with larger genomes tend to have relatively larger polymerases, which we speculate might reflect a higher copying fidelity, whereas the equally essential nucleocapid proteins show no such tendency (Figure 2\n).

The exceptionally high mutation rates of RNA viruses provide, at least theoretically, the potential for rapid molecular adaptation. This has important consequences, such as in the viral adaptation to adaptive immune defences or our acquisition of new diseases through zoonotic transmission. However, such adaptation is, somewhat paradoxically, highly constrained by the nature of RNA virus genomes, which, owing to their small size, must exhibit high levels of pleiotropy, fitness trade-offs, epistasis and convergent evolution [34]. Thus, rather than being infinitely flexible, it is better to view RNA viruses as restless beasts pacing a small cage \u2013 they are capable of rapid adaptive switching among a set of limited phenotypes. The high mutation rate that enables swift viral evolutionary change is the same factor that reduces the complexity of potential viral adaptations, owing to the upper limit that it imposes on viral genome size.",

First, it should be possible to test whether genomic properties such as genome size and recombination rate are correlated to viral life-history traits, and to investigate how particular genomic architectures enable viruses to deal with innate and adaptive immune responses. We predict that RNA viruses (and perhaps small DNA viruses) are associated more with hit-and-run and adaptive escape strategies that depend on high replication and high mutation rates, respectively; by contrast, the complex immune sabotage strategies of the large DNA viruses (e.g. murine cytomegalovirus) involve genes dedicated to this function, and we therefore expect them to be associated with larger genomes [5].",

As we outlined earlier, further theoretical development would assist the development of lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral therapy. In particular, the biological realism of existing model assumptions requires greater consideration. Genomic robustness is another topic that warrants further theoretical exploration and empirical investigation, especially as this incorporates questions of epistasis and genome complexity that apply to all taxa [41]. The simple genomes and experimental tractability of RNA viruses make them an ideal model system for this subject, and there are now methods for selecting experimentally for reduced mutational robustness in viruses [42].",

We further note an inescapable corollary of our \u2018small cage\u2019 metaphor: because current RNA viruses inhabit different cages, evolutionary events that enable viruses to explore an entirely new set of behaviours must occasionally occur. Although almost certainly rare, these viral \u2018paradigm shifts\u2019 are of the greatest importance in viral evolution. Candidate events for such transitions include the acquisition of new accessory genes in large nidoviruses [44] and the recombination event that generated a new alphavirus lineage [45]. Viruses have proved to be invaluable model systems for many evolutionary questions, and there is no reason to suppose that they will be any less revealing in the study of macroevolution and evolutionary transitions.",
