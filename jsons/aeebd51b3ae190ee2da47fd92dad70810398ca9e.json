Among these, a change at residue 324, first reported in 2006 (Zhou, Zeng, Zhang, & Li, 2017) , may represent a common change in CPV strains circulating in the Asian continent (Geng et al., 2015) . Recently, change Thr324Ile has been observed in European CPV-2a strains (Cs agola, Varga, L} orincz, & Tuboly, 2014) . The aim of this work was to report the detection and genetic characterization of a CPV strain from a dog imported from Thailand to Italy.",

Laos is located between China and Thailand, the latter being the country of origin of the infected dog. In the same country, a high prevalence of CPV strains closely related to Chinese isolates has been recently reported (Vannamahaxay et al., 2017) . After the first report of CPV in Thailand (Tingpalapong et al., 1982) , only CPV-2a/ 2b types have been proven to circulate in this country, with no evidence for the presence of the variant 2c (Phromnoi, Sirinarumitr, & Sirinarumitr, 2010) . The findings of the present study suggest that CPV-2c is currently circulating in more Asian countries than previously reported, which deserves further extensive surveillance.",

While others were synonymous substitutions, the nonsynonymous change G415A results in the aa change Val139Ile, due to a transition in the first position of the codon. This aa residue is located inside the capsid, forming part of the beta barrel of the viral capsid (Clegg et al., 2011) . Comparison with VP2 sequences available in the GenBank database shows that this change occurred into CPV-2a/CPV-2b sequences from Asia (Chinchkar et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2015) , Brazil (Pereira, Leal, & Durigon, 2007) (Decaro et al., 2007; Martella et al., 2006) .

RFLP carried out on the CPV PCR product generated three fragments of 56, 275 and 369 bp, respectively, which are typical of CPV-2c. By subsequent PCR amplifications, a sequence of 4450 nt was obtained. On the basis of aa residue Glu at residue 426 of the VP2 protein, the strain (CPV_IZSSI_2743_17) was characterized as currently named CPV-2c, confirming the RFLP result. NS1 and VP2 sequences showed 100% nucleotide identities with Asian strains CPV/CN/LN1/2014 (China, 2014) for NS1 sequence and BJ14-9 and BJ14-8 (China, 2014) for VP2 sequence. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of aa changes never observed in European CPV strains (NS1: Ile60Val, Tyr544Phe, Glu545Val, Leu630Pro;",

Some non-synonymous (encoding for aa changes Ile60Val and Leu630Pro) and synonymous (A51G, C159T, G1752A, A1800G) substitutions between European and Asian strains are located in the NS2-encoding sequence(Table 1). To our best knowledge, there is no full-length genomic sequence available for Asian CPV-2c strains, so that our strain CPV_IZSSI_2743_17 is the T A B L E 1 Nucleotide and deduced amino acid (in brackets) variations in NS1/VP2 sequences in analysed CPV strains",

The presence of different nt and aa changes between European and Asian CPV strains and the presence of high genetic identities among Asian strains support the Asian origin of the CPV strain detected in the imported pup, thus representing the first evidence in Europe of a CPV-2c strain with Asian signatures. In addition, determining the nearly complete genome of this Asian-like CPV contributes to gain new information about these Asian CPV strains for further studies. Trading and transport of dogs between countries and continents play an important role in introduction or re-introduction of novel or re-emerging viral strains, as already observed for other canine viruses",
