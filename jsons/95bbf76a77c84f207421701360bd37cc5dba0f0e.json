Researchers, technologists, doctors and other healthcare workers are working day and night on the development of vaccine and medicinesto control and treat this virus. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus responsible for causing COVID-19 disease, which is highly infectious and lethal.With exponentially increasing infections, proportionate fatalities are being reported both from developed and under developed countries. As of today, more than one million people across the world have been reported infected with this virus, and more than 65,000 people have died of this disease. Hence, there is an urgent requirement for conducting academic research on several aspects of this highly contagious disease, to find effective means of containment and treatment of the disease, for now, and in future. We have identified some opportunities for academic research related to COVID-19 and have also provided suggestions to contain, prevent and treat this viral infection.",

The costs involved in the containment and treatment of this infectious disease are exorbitantly high, which even the wealthiestand developed countries are finding it difficult to sustain. COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the crude, stock market, gold and metals and almost all areas of the global market [1] . Large research laboratories and corporate houses are working with a high speed to develop medicines and vaccines for the prevention and treatment of this dreaded disease. To deal with these current health management challenges, we need a comprehensive understanding of the effect on the health system, global business, and culture. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO on11th March 2020 [2] . COVID-19 has become an international emergency in a short period and will have long-lasting effects. There is an urgent need to identify and study the areas of academic research which will be impacted by COVID-19 [3] .",
