The objective of this study is to determine prospectively the etiology of community-acquired pulmonary infections in hospitalized adults living with HIV. Patients were submitted to an extended microbiological investigation that included molecular methods. The microbiological findings were evaluated according to severity of the disease and pneumococcal vaccine status. Two hundred twenty-four patients underwent the extended microbiological investigation of whom 143 (64%) had an etiology determined. Among the 143 patients with a determined etiology, Pneumocystis jirovecii was the main agent, detected in 52 (36%) cases and followed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis accounting for 28 (20%) cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Rhinovirus were diagnosed in 22 (15%) cases each and influenza in 15 (10%) cases. Among atypical bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae was responsible for 12 (8%) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae for 7 (5%) cases. Mixed infections occurred in 48 cases (34%). S pneumoniae was associated with higher severity scores and not associated with vaccine status. By using extended diagnostics, a microbiological agent could be determined in the majority of patients living with HIV affected by community-acquired pulmonary infections. Our findings can guide clinicians in the choice of empirical therapy for hospitalized pulmonary disease.",

            "text": "Pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV). Its incidence has decreased after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), but these patients still have a higher risk of acquiring this type of infection than the general population and have higher mortality rates. [1] The epidemiology of HIV-associated pulmonary disease is complex and influenced by various factors, notably the regional prevalence of pathogens, such as tuberculosis, and the accessibility to health care, mainly the access to effective antiretroviral therapy and antimicrobial prophylaxis. [2] The study of the etiological agents of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is important to guide empirical therapy, requires constant updating, and has a substantial impact on the prognosis of patients. [3] However, few studies have systematically investigated the etiology of pneumonia in PLHIV and there is no consensus on a diagnostic algorithm for these patients. [4] A recently studied algorithm among non-HIV patients showed that, by supplementing traditional diagnostic methods with new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, a high microbial yield is achieved among adults admitted to a general hospital due to CAP. This study also showed that mixed infections are frequent in this setting. [5] The main purpose of this study was to determine prospectively the etiology of community-acquired pulmonary infections in hospitalized adults living with HIV. This study also aimed to analyze the contribution of different diagnostic methods, including those PCR-based, as well of the impact of different approaches to microbiological evaluation and to evaluate the microbiological findings in relation to the CD4+ T-cell count, the severity of disease, and pneumococcal vaccine status.",

Our finding of high rates of atypical bacterial infections may support atypical coverage in the empirical treatment of these patients. In Brazil, for PLHIV, the use of 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine is recommended. In this study, approximately one-third of the patients who knew about their vaccination status referred antipneumococcal vaccination. The frequency of S pneumoniae infection was similar for vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals. This finding is in agreement with a systematic review that concluded that clinical evidence provides only moderate support for recommendation of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination in PLHIV, [14] however the number of confirmed pneumococcal pneumonias in our study was small and this may have limited the statistical power to detect differences.",

Thus, our population were late presenters and presented poor adherence to HAART, as described previously [10, 15] in CAP cohorts of PLHIV and that appears to be the general profile of PLHIV who require hospitalization.
