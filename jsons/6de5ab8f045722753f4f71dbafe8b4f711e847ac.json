            "text": "The intermediates 22e, 22k, and 23k were subjected to further manipulations to obtain the functionalized derivatives (Scheme 3.4) . The nitro group of 22e was reduced by hydrogenation to form the 9-amino derivative 28. Alkylation of 28 afforded the 9-(N-methylamino) derivative 22b (eq 1). The 9-acetamide derivative 22c was obtained by treatment of 28 with acetic anhydride (eq 2). Sandmeyer reaction of 28 gave the 9-azide derivative 22p (eq 3). Me 2 N-and MeO-substituted derivatives (22a, 23a, and 23f) were obtained by Me 2 NH-mediated N-arylation [4, 5] of the 9-bromo 22k and 10-bromo derivatives 23k, and NaOMe-mediated Reagents and conditions (a) p-TsCl, pyridine, CHCl 3 , rt; (b) PCC, silica gel, CH 2 Cl 2 , rt, 80 % [2 steps (a, b) ]; (c) 1,3-propanediamine, I 2 , K 2 CO 3 , t-BuOH, 70\u00b0C, 98 %; (d) conc.

The 9-acetyl derivative 22d was obtained by Heck reaction [7] of 22k with 2-hydroxyethyl vinyl ether (eq 5). Other derivatives with a variety of functional groups (22, 23, 29, and 30) were synthesized by Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions [8, 9] of 22k and 23k with boronic acids or their pinacol esters (eq 6 and 7). Final deprotection of the tert-butyl group in 22, 23, 29, and 30 afforded the 9-or 10-substituted pyrimido [1,2-c] [1, 3] benzothiazine derivatives 25, 26, 31, and 32, respectively. Benzo [e] [1, 3] thiazine derivatives with various ring-sized and/or modified cyclic amidine moieties 36 were synthesized using standard synthetic methods (Scheme 3.5) . Oxidative addition using a number of diamines 33 proceeded efficiently to form five-or six-membered rings (34a-d). The same reaction for the seven-membered amidine (34e) was incomplete, but purification of the Boc-protected amidine 37 followed by subsequent deprotection of the Boc group gave the pure seven-membered amidine 34e. The resulting amidines were converted to cyclic-amidine-fused benzo [e] [1, 3] thiazin-2-imines 35 via tert-butyl isothiocyanate addition and an S N Ar reaction. TFA-mediated deprotection gave the expected derivatives 36. The synthesis of the spiropyrimidine-fused derivatives started with the dialkylation of malononitrile with dihaloalkanes (38, 39, or 41, Scheme 3.6) . BH 3mediated reduction of the alkylated malononitriles (42-44) followed by oxidative amidination with 4-bromo-2-fluorobenzaldehyde gave the 2-phenyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives (45-47) . Subsequent exposure of compounds 45-47 to tert-butylisothiocyanate provided the tetracyclic compounds 48, 50, and 52a. Deprotection of the tert-butyl groups in compounds 48, 50, and 52a afforded the desired spiropyrimidine-fused benzothiazinimine derivatives (49, 51, and 53a) .",

The antiviral activities against the HIV-1 IIIB strain were evaluated using the MAGI assay [10] .

The addition of positively charged N,N-dimethylamino (25a) and Nmethylamino groups (25b) at the 9-position significantly decreased the anti-HIV activity. The 9-acetamide group (25c), which has hydrogen bond donor/acceptor abilities, also attenuated the bioactivity. The acetyl (25d) and nitro (25e) groups, with hydrogen acceptor properties, induced slight decreases in the anti-HIV activity. In contrast, derivatives with less-polarized substituents (25f-o and 25q) at this position generally reproduced the potent anti-HIV activity of 1. In terms of the electron-donating or -withdrawing properties of the substituent groups on the benzene substructure, good correlations were not observed. For example, the electron-donating methoxy (25f), methyl (25g), and n-butyl groups (25h), and the electron-withdrawing fluoro (25i) and trifluoromethyl groups (25j) exhibited similar anti-HIV activities (EC 50 = 0.44-0.57 lM), indicating that the antiviral activity is independent of the electronic state of the 1,3-benzothiazin-2-imine core in forming potential p-stacking interaction(s) with the target molecules.

The naphtho [2,3-e] [1, 3] thiazine derivative 27r, with a 9,10-fused benzene, exhibited anti-HIV activity equipotent to that of the parent 1 (EC 50 = 0.56 lM). A 6-fold decrease in the anti-HIV activity of the pyridinefused pyrido [3,2-e] [1, 3] thiazine derivative (27s) was observed (EC 50 = 2.55 lM). In addition, introduction of 8-bromo (27k) and 8,9-fused benzene (27t, naphtho[2,1-e] [1, 3] thiazine) substituents on benzothiazine resulted in a loss of activity, suggesting that modification at the 8-position was inappropriate for favorable interactions with the target molecule(s). The 11-fluoro derivative 27i and thiophene-fused 27u, the latter of which has 5-6-6 framework (thieno [2,3-e] [1, 3] thiazine), exhibited four times lower and no inhibitory potencies, respectively. On the basis of the above SAR data for the benzene substructure in 1 (PD 404182), the author expected that introduction of a hydrophobic group at the pyrimido [1,2-c] [1, 3] benzothiazine 9-position would be the most promising. The next optimization to obtain more potent derivatives was therefore focused on modification of the benzothiazine scaffold at position 9 with an additional aryl group (Tables 3.3, 3.4) . The author initially examined substituent effects at the para-position on the 9phenyl group of compound 25l. Modification with methoxycarbonyl (31a), cyano (31b), nitro (31c), and trifluoromethyl (31d) groups slightly reduced the anti-HIV activity (EC 50 = 0.44-0.81 lM), whereas a significant decrease in the anti-HIV activity was observed for a carbamoyl group (31e), with hydrogen bond donor/ acceptor properties (EC 50 = 8.71 lM). The hydrophobic methoxy (31f, Similar effects as a result of modification at the meta-position of the 9-phenyl group were observed. Addition of electron-withdrawing methoxycarbonyl (31i), cyano (31j), and nitro (31k) (EC 50 = 0.39-1.26 lM) groups resulted in slight decreases in anti-HIV activity. Hydrophilic (1-hydroxy)ethyl (31l, EC 50 = 1.19 lM), acetylamino (31m), mesylamino (31n), and hydroxyl (31o, EC 50 = 2.62 lM) groups induced reduction or loss of anti-HIV activity. In contrast, a methoxy group (31p) improved the inhibitory activity (EC 50 = 0.15 lM). The more hydrophobic isopropoxy group (31q) maintained the anti-HIV activity of 25l (EC 50 = 0.32 lM), whereas a phenyl group (31r) decreased the inhibitory activity (EC 50 = 1.35 lM). Similar anti-HIV activities of the ortho-methoxy (31s) and ortho-phenyl group (31t) to that of 25l were exhibited (EC 50 = 0.41 and 0.32 lM, respectively), suggesting that the twisted conformations of these 9-phenyl PD 404182 derivatives might not prevent the interaction with the target molecule(s).",

            "text": "To gain additional insights into the mechanism of action of PD 404182 derivatives, the antiviral activities against other HIV subtypes were evaluated (Table 3 .7). Compound 1 was effective against not only HIV-1 IIIB but also other two HIV-1 strains (HIV-1 NL4-3 and HIV-1 BaL ) with similar potency. Both HIV-1 IIIB and HIV-1 NL4-3 strains utilize CXCR4 as a coreceptor for entry, while HIV-1 BaL strain does CCR5, indicating that chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 are not the molecular targets of PD 404182 derivatives. The similar level of antiviral activity of 1 against HIV-2 (HIV-2 EHO and HIV-2 ROD ), which is mainly distributed in West Africa, was observed. Highly potent inhibitory activities of derivatives 32c and 36d 2 against these HIV strains were observed, as in the case of the SAR study of the HIV-1 IIIB strain discussed above. It has been well-known that NNRTIs are not effective against HIV-2, highlighting that PD 404182 derivatives do not act as NNRTIs. Although PD 404182 derivatives and enfuvirtide showed similar anti-HIV-1 profile in the time of drug addition assay, HIV-2 EHO and HIV-2 ROD infection were affected by PD 404182 derivatives, in contrast with the less effective enfuvirtide [21] , suggesting that PD 404182 derivatives may not be directed at the HIV gp41 envelope protein. Recent reports have suggested that the antiviral activities of compound 1 against HIV, HCV, and pseudotype lentiviruses were derived from disruption of the structural integrities of virions [2] . Although the mechanism of action of PD 404182 derivatives is not fully understood at this In conclusion, the author have designed and synthesized PD 404182 derivatives for a novel series of anti-HIV agents. Comprehensive SAR studies demonstrated that the 6-6-6 fused pyrimido [1,2-c] [1, 3] benzothiazine scaffold and the heteroatom arrangement in the thiazinimine moiety are indispensable for the inhibitory activity of 1 (PD 404182) against HIV infection. Optimization studies of the benzene and cyclic amidine rings indicate that the introduction of a hydrophobic group on the benzene ring is more effective in improving the antiviral activity, giving potential favorable interaction(s) with the target molecule(s). The most potent compound, 32c, had anti-HIV activity three times higher than that of the parent 1. In addition, PD 404182 derivatives could be promising agents for treatment of HIV-2 infection. The author also revealed, using a time of drug addition experiment, that PD 404182 derivatives prevent the HIV infection process at a fusion or binding process.",

On the following day, the cells were inoculated with the HIV-1 (60 MAGI U/well, giving 60 blue cells after 48 h of incubation) and cultured in the presence of various concentrations of the test compounds in fresh medium. Forty-eight hours after viral exposure, all the blue cells stained with X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside) were counted in each well. The activity of test compounds was determined as the concentration that blocked HIV-1 infection by 50 % (50 % effective concentration [EC 50 ]). EC 50 was determined by using the following formula:EC 50 = 10^[log(A/B) 9 (50 -C)/(D -C) ? log(B)], wherein A: of the two points on the graph which bracket 50 % inhibition, the higher concentration of the test compound, B: of the two points on the graph which bracket 50 % inhibition, the lower concentration of the test compound, C: inhibitory activity (%) at the concentration B, D: inhibitory activity (%) at the concentration A.",
