            "text": "One of the major drawbacks of conventional BRTO is that BRTO is a time-consuming procedure. Although sclerosis can be obtained within 3 h after injection of the sclerosant, an inflated balloon catheter is left in place for 4\u201324 h in patients at risk of coil migration or sclerosant leakage. There are many reports regarding BRTO being performed in this manner [6, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16]. The length of this procedure potentially carries a risk of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolization, and balloon rupture in addition to the burden on the patient in terms of discomfort and limitations on movement. To overcome this drawback, the new strategy of plug-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration (PATRO) was developed [2]. Although this procedure is associated with a relatively high rate of GV recurrence, procedure time was shortened because immediate removal of the catheter is achievable with the Amplatzer vascular plug. Lee et al. then introduced coil-assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration (CARTO) [10], using coils instead of an inflated balloon catheter. This procedure can be performed in patients with smaller and larger shunts because of the availability of a wide variety of coil diameters. In this procedure, two catheters were inserted into the drainage vein and the narrowest portion of the gastro-renal (GR) shunt. After coil embolization via the catheter into the GR shunt, gelfoam slurry or sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) was injected through the microcatheter in the GV. Here, we report on our experience with a modified CARTO procedure. We follow a standard BRTO with a balloon catheter, deploying multiple coils through the balloon catheter to prevent migration of the sclerosant. After the coils are placed, the occluding balloon can be removed. This technique was introduced as CARTO-II by Kim et al. [4]. In the review report, only one case was shown in a figure regarding this approach. The purpose of this study was thus to confirm the utility of CARTO-II by evaluating the feasibility, safety and clinical outcomes.",

The study was initially designed to include 41 consecutive patients who had undergone BRTO for GV in our institute between June 2016 and April 2018. Thirty-six patients were finally enrolled, after excluding five patients who underwent emergent BRTO (n = 3), were found to be ineligible for BRTO due to high wedge pressure of the hepatic vein (45 mmHg) after temporary occlusion of the GR shunt (n = 1), or who did not undergo BRTO due to visualization of apparent portopulmonary vein anastomosis (PPVA) during the procedure (n = 1). Endoscopic findings of GV were classified according to the criteria proposed by the Japanese Society for Portal Hypertension [14]. Briefly, the form of the GV was classified as: F1, straight, small-caliber varices; F2, moderately enlarged, beady varices; or F3, markedly enlarged, nodular, or tumor-shaped varices. Treatment was performed for GV that were endoscopically categorized as F2 or more, showed positive results for the red color sign, and were progressing.",

The basic system involved introduction of a catheter into the right femoral vein with a 9-Fr/5-Fr double coaxial balloon catheter system (CANDIS, Medikit, Tokyo, Japan) or 5-Fr balloon catheter (Selecon MP cobra catheter; Terumo Clinical Supply, Gifu, Japan) for GR shunt access, introduction into the right femoral vein or left internal jugular vein with microballoon catheter (Pinnacle Blue, Tokai Medical, Kasugai, Japan, or Masamune, Fuji Systems, Tokyo, Japan) for IPV shunt or PCV access. Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous venography (BRTV) was performed to classify patients according to Hirota\u2019s criteria. All patients were confirmed to be free of PPVA by BRTV. Before embolization of GV, wedge pressure of the right hepatic vein was measured through the additional balloon catheter inserted into the right hepatic vein to confirm the portal pressure. Patients underwent treatment with 5% ethanolamine oleate iopamidol (EOI) [10% ethanolamine oleate (Oldamin, ASKA Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) mixed with the same volume of nonionic contrast medium (iopamidol 300 mg I/mL, Iopamiron 300, Bayer Schering Pharma, Osaka, Japan)] with or without gelatin sponge particles. At least 10 min after finishing EOI injection, coil embolization of the drainage vein was performed through the balloon catheter or microcatheter inserted in the balloon catheter (Fig. 1). At least 30 min after EOI injection, the balloon catheter and sheath were removed. To prevent renal dysfunction caused by EOI-induced hemolysis, drip infusion of 4000 U of haptoglobin was performed during injection of the 5% EOI.",

Because large coils > 30 mm are available and the narrowest portion of the GR shunt was thought to be less than the maximum short diameter of the coils, this technique could be applied to almost all varices. In PARTO, the maximum diameter of available Amplatzer vascular plugs was 22 mm. This procedure cannot be applied for GV with a large shunt. Moreover, CARTO-II was performed via the IPV and PCV. Although these veins have not been frequently reported as drainage veins, BRTO through these veins has been described [1]. However, these veins are basically narrow compared to the GR shunt, and inserting a sheath to use an Amplatzer vascular plug is difficult. Because coil placement in CARTO-II can be performed through a microcatheter, CARTO-II could be performed from various kinds of drainage veins, even intercostal veins [12]. This is considered as one advantage of the CARTO-II technique.",

CARTO-II is considered much cheaper than CARTO. The reason for the lower number of coils used is the fact that total occlusion is not required in CARTO-II. In CARTO, sclerosants are injected after complete occlusion of the drainage vein, whereas CARTO-II places coils to prevent migration of coagulated blood and thus avoid pulmonary embolization. Sclerosis of GV was completed through the balloon catheter before coil embolization. This use of a relatively lower number of coils shortens the procedure time and reduces costs. Mean procedure length (time from entering the angiography room to leaving the room) was 132.8 min (2.2 h) in this study, compared to 2.82 h for CARTO [10]. This time included the time to ready the patient for the procedure in the room and the time to measure wedge pressure (at least 15 min). Mean procedure time for CARTO-II was under 2 h. Generally, procedure length appears shorter for CARTO-II than for CARTO. One reason for this short procedure length was the lack of any need to wait for complete occlusion before injecting sclerosants. CARTO-II can thus be considered less time-consuming and expensive than CARTO.",

With CARTO-II, the only difference from conventional BRTO using sclerosant is the use of coils after sclerosis. This technique does not place specific limits on the type of sclerosant. In the PARTO procedure with gelfoam slurry, the recurrence rate was initially relatively high (32.8% at 1 year) [5]. A modified method with gelfoam followed by STS has shown better outcomes approaching a 0% of recurrence rate [4], In a study of conventional BRTO using STS only, 1-year recurrence rate was reported to be 1.3%. In a study of conventional BRTO using lauromacrogol, complete obliteration of GVs was confirmed in all 31 patients (100%) on CT [11]. In a prospective study of conventional BRTO using EOI, the rate of complete thrombosis of GV according to CECT on day 90 was 93.0% (40 of 43 patients) [6]. In this report, the complete regression rate of GV according to endoscopy on day 90 was 97.2%. Theoretically, the clinical outcomes should be similar to those of conventional BRTO with EOI.",
