Thus many additional newsworthy events, including the release of the long-awaited NICE AAA guidelines (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng156), are passing by largely unnoticed. NICE, an acronym for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, is an executive non-departmental unit of the Department of Health in England. It regularly generates and updates guidelines regarding the optimal use of health technology, as well as clinical practice directives and guidance for social care services and health promotion in the United Kingdom (UK).",

This was followed by additional mandates to not offer endovascular repair simply on the basis of anatomic complexity or medical comorbidity or for complex AAA repair outside of the auspices of a clinical trial (draft guidelines 1.5.4, 5 and 6, respectively). EVAR was recommended only as an alternative for management of ruptured AAA (rAAA) vs. traditional open repair, with no specific preference for either method recommended for most patients.",

Feedback was distilled into sixteen distinct themes, ranging from evidence demonstrating an increased peri-operative mortality for open surgical repair (OSR), as well as increased theater time (and subsequent expense), hospital stay, and rehabilitation expenses as compared to endovascular repair, to concern regarding how proficiency and familiarity with EVAR for managing rAAA could be maintained by surgeons and centers if all other applications of this technology (elective, complex, etc.) were discouraged.",

And this interpretation is key to understanding these recommendations \u2013 for cost-effectiveness modeling, only UK-specific data was incorporated based on the assessment that the unique financial fundamentals of the NHS precludes consideration of non-UK derived data. Given their fixed expenses, reliance on in-patient care, etc., the potential for further evolution of standard EVAR to out-patient interventional platforms (as has been recently reported from Canada and elsewhere), for example, would not significantly impact their cost effectiveness analysis.",
