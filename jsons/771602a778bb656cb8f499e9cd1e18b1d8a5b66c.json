            "text": "Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) are antiretroviral protease inhibitors used in combination for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection since 2000. RTV is used together with LPV to increase the LPV half-life via inhibition of cytochrome P450 and acts only as its pharmacokinetic enhancer. 3 LPV acts against the viral 3-chymotrypsin-like protease and has been reported with promising results against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. 4-6 LOTUS China trial (Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in China), which is a randomized, controlled, open-label study, was initiated to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral LPV/RTV for SARS-CoV-2 infection in 199 adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either LPV/RTV (400 mg/100 mg) twice a day in addition to standard care (n = 99) or standard care alone (n = 100) for 14 days. The result showed no difference in clinical improvement between the two groups (hazard ratio = 1.24, 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality at 28 days was also similar in both groups (19.2% vs 25.0%, 95% CI, -17.3 to 5.7). The author concluded that no benefit was observed with LPV/RTV treatment beyond standard care in adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID- 19. 7 Remdesivir (RDV) is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead Sciences, originally for the treatment of Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. RDV is an adenosine nucleotide analogue with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, which acts as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). 8 RDV inhibits viral replication through premature termination of RNA transcription and has been demonstrated to improve pulmonary function and reduce lung viral loads in mice infected with MERS-CoV. 9 A recent in vitro study indicated that RDV potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 (EC 50 = 0.77 \u03bcM) in Vero E6 cells. 10 A single case report by Holshue et al 11 described clinical improvement after RDV used to treat the first US case of COVID-19. There are several randomized control trials currently being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RDV in patients with COVID-19. Two phase III trials initiated in China in February 2020, aimed to evaluate RDV in hospitalized adult patients with mild/moderate (NCT04252664) or severe (NCT04257656) COVID-19 (RDV 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg once daily for 9 days vs placebo). Preliminary Abstract: The emerging outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 continues to spread all over the world. Agents or vaccines of proven efficacy to treat or prevent human coronavirus infection are in urgent need and are being investigated vigorously worldwide. This review summarizes the current evidence of potential therapeutic agents, such as lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, interferon, ribavirin, tocilizumab, and sarilumab. More clinical trials are being conducted for further confirmation of the efficacy and safety of these agents in treating COVID-19.",

The preliminary results reported significant clinical differences between FPV (35 patients) and LPV/RTV (45 patients) with median viral clearance time (4 vs 11 days, p < 0.001) and chest image improvement rate (91.43% vs 62.22%, p = 0.004). 13 Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (H0) are aminoquinolines, which have been used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases for over 50 years. These two drugs are weak diprotic bases and can elevate the pH of the endosome, which prevents viral fusion into the cell. 14 Recent in vitro studies reported CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 with EC 50 = 2.71 and 4.51 \u03bcM in Vero E6 cells, respectively. 15 Several clinical trials are being conducted in China to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19, one of which revealed that chloroquine is superior to the control group in clinical improvement, promoting virus-negative conversion and shortening the disease course. 16 Meanwhile, the preliminary study in France evaluated the efficacy of HCQ in COVID-19 patients. There were two groups in this study, 26 patients received HCQ (200 mg tid for 10 days) and 16 patients received standard of care. Six HCQ group patients lost to follow up due to early cessation of treatment. Six patients in HCQ group received additional azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, 250 mg once daily for 4 days) to prevent bacterial superinfection. The result showed the virologically cured rate was significantly higher in HCQ combined with azithromycin-treated patients compared with the HCQ only group or control group (100% vs 57.1% vs 12.5%, p = 0.001). 17 Although this study demonstrated promising results, further larger trials are still needed to verify the efficacy and safety of HCQ alone or in combination with azithromycin in COVID-19. In addition, HCQ as postexposure prophylaxis/preemptive therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection is now under evaluation in the USA (NCT04308668), using the regimen of 800 mg orally once, followed in 6 to 8 hours by 600 mg, then 600 mg once a day for four consecutive days. The results shall be reported soon.",

Measures to stop the pandemic through discovering and identifying effective treatment or prophylactic agents are crucial. To date, several agents have demonstrated with some efficacy to COVID-19 in humans, but mostly through case reports or preliminary data from clinical trials with small sample sizes. Many ongoing randomized controlled trials are currently being conducted to further confirm these results. With the joint effort of the healthcare professionals and the scientific community worldwide, new evidence for managing COVID-19 is expected to be revealed shortly. Although the potential treatment agents discussed here may provide clinical benefits, it should also be noted that each of the medications may lead to substantial side effects. Healthcare professionals should take great caution during practice.",
