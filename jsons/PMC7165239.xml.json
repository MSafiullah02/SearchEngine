The first COVID-related death occurred 4 weeks later, associated with a separate site, a long-term care facility in Kirkland, Washington, which rapidly became a cluster of 30 fatal cases as of March 16th. At the writing of this article, March 17th, there are 1012 confirmed cases in the state of Washington, with 52 deaths, primarily in King County. Evergreen Health, the major medical center in Kirkland, has recently declared that they have no remaining critical care capacity.",

For the United States, public health experts worry that this outbreak will continue to escalate, at least in the short term.4 With this backdrop, cancer care remains an essential clinical need, for which timely radiation therapy is a cornerstone modality. Concurrently, patients with cancer may have a 5-fold relative risk for severe manifestations (eg, requirement for invasive ventilation) and death, compared with the general population.5 In this article, we report our experience with delivering high-quality, patient-centered radiation therapy at an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic within the United States.

On average, more than 220 patients are treated each day in our department, with cases ranging in complexity from whole-breast radiation therapy to immunocompromised, pediatric patients requiring anesthesia. Immediately after the public announcement of the presence of COVID-19 in our community, our department serially instituted policies and procedures that synthesized national, state, and institution-specific infection control guidance within a radiation oncology\u2013appropriate model. Three overlapping goals to mitigate transmission while continuing to deliver high-quality treatments were identified: social distancing, preservation of the pool of health care providers, and conservation of personal protection equipment.",

Using an extended susceptible, latent, infectious, and removed constitutive model fitted to empirical data from the outbreak in China, biostatisticians at the Broad Institute and Harvard University have shown that social distancing methods, ranging in aggressiveness from a city-wide lockdown to centralized quarantine, were effective in dampening the reproductive number of COVID-19, ultimately controlling the outbreak in Wuhan.6 In our application, employees who can perform duties remotely (eg, research coordinators, research residents, administrative staff, and some medical physics staff) are instructed to work from home. The minimum level of staffing to maintain safe treatments at each practice site is deployed based on patient volume and complexity. Meetings have been limited to 5 persons or fewer, with at least 6 feet of distance between any 2 individuals. Nearly all tumor boards have transitioned to virtual conferencing, with the exception of small meetings with 5 persons or fewer and 1 tumor board in which in-person coordination was considered indispensable to patient care. In this regard, our institution has expanded teleconferencing capacity to be able to support up to 50,000 simultaneous online conferences. Crucially, during the relatively short roll-out of distancing policies, a relatively user-friendly teleconferencing solution was promulgated. This empowered any single user to initiate an individualized, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u2013compliant teleconference session on demand.",

A site visit to our clinics by our institution\u2019s infection control team was highly valuable, and this experience directly led to specific interventions that bolstered the continued treatment of patients while mitigating transmission risk. This session incorporated end-to-end patient tracing to identify opportunities to mitigate patient-to-patient, patient-to-staff, and staff-to-staff transmission. Screening of patients and staff for upper respiratory symptoms (fever, cough, rhinorrhea) is crucial for infection control. At many of our sites, there are multiple ports of entry into the clinic. As such, all patients are screened twice: once upon entering the building and again upon entering the department. Patients who are positive on screening for symptoms are asked to wear a mask, are placed in a private room where they are evaluated by a provider over telephone, and are appropriately triaged. Details of our testing algorithm specific to our patient population can be found in Figure 1\n. All patients are asked to either thoroughly wash their hands or use effective hand sanitizers upon entering and leaving an examination or treatment room.",

Because radiation therapy is often a necessary part of lifesaving cancer care, we anticipate treating patients with presumed or proven COVID-19. For the standard treatment, our institution has recommended droplet precautions (surgical mask, goggles, gloves, gown) and the use of a private waiting room. These patients will be treated at the end of the day, in a particular vault that is extensively decontaminated afterward. For treatments with anesthesia, the risk of aerosol transmission is high, and airborne precautions are required (N-95 mask, face shield, gloves, gown, and a personal respirator in some instances). At our main facility, a negative-pressure vault is available for treating patients requiring airborne precautions.",

To mitigate this risk, immobilization devices such as VakLok bags are individually disinfected and wrapped in a plastic bag that is sealed and changed after each daily use (Fig 2\n). Other hardware that comes into direct contact with patients, such as treatment tables and positioning aides, are extensively disinfected between uses. For respiratory motion management, we have developed a protocol for the use of the Active Breathing Controller (Elekta Inc), which is used at several centers. Some elements of this device cannot be decontaminated, so the device will not be used in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and abdominal compression will be used instead.",

Balancing training and the principles of social distancing, provider preservation, and PPE conservation is a delicate task. Although immersion and availability have been beneficial tenets of training, they are subsumed by the need to mitigate transmission. Residents on a research block or on days without patient visits are instructed to work from home. All lectures and didactic activities have moved to videoconference. Most difficult of all in light of our collective appreciation of time with patients, minimization of redundant encounters requiring both residents and attendings to see the patient is encouraged. With specific focus on trainees, there are valuable lessons from prior viral epidemics. After the 2003 SARS epidemic in Toronto, trainees who were quarantined reported high levels of psychological distress, particularly those who were not contacted for wellness checks during their isolation.8 Effective rather than effusive communication from hospital leadership was found to facilitate coping. Coherent communication is uniquely important to trainees, who often straddle all sites of practice within a radiation oncology program. Empowering trainees to stay home if they have symptoms should be of utmost concern; during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, 67% of residents with influenza-like illness still reported to work at a US training hospital, despite perceiving the risk of H1N1 transmission to be high.9 It is imperative to have clear messaging from departmental leadership regarding expectations while simultaneously allaying concerns of any detriment to professional development as a result of missing work.",

Our department also recognizes that many of our residents and faculty have young children and face tremendous challenges as schools and childcare services have begun shutting down in the Seattle area. Furthermore, some have partners who are internal medicine trainees and have already been asked to directly care for COVID-19 patients or to cover clinics so others may care for COVID-19 patients as the health care provider pool becomes depleted. Many trainees have neither the resources to hire personal back-up care nor the social network to summon pro bono care. As a response, we have initiated a grassroots effort to pool childcare resources within the UW medical community. Many university and medical students on academic furlough due to the pandemic have volunteered to serve as childcare resources specifically for health care providers.",
