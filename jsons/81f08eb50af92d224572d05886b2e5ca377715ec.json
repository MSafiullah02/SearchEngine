Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for SARS-CoV-2 [3], the 36 origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, 37 denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats 38 collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October, 2019. Notably, 39 RmYN02 shares 93.3% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 at the scale of the complete 40 virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene, in which it is the closest relative of 41 SARS-CoV-2 reported to date. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity 42 (61.3%) to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to 43 angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, and in a similar manner to 44 8 using Simplot [10] also revealed that RmYN02 was more similar to SARS-CoV-2 than 137 RaTG13 in most genome regions ( Figure 1A ). Again, in the RBD, the 138 pangolin/MP789/2019 virus shared the highest sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure  139 1B). 140 141 Results from both homology modelling [2] , in vitro assays [3] and resolved 142 three-dimensional structure of the S protein [11] have revealed that like SARS-CoV, 143 SARS-CoV-2 could also use ACE2 as a cell receptor. We analyzed the RBD of RmYN02, 144 RaTG13, and the two pangolin beta-CoVs using homology modelling ( The S protein of CoVs is functionally cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2 [15] in a similar 171 manner to the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The insertion 172 of polybasic amino acids at the cleavage site in the HAs of some AIV subtypes is 173 associated with enhanced pathogenicity [16, 17] . Notably, SARS-CoV-2 is characterized 174 by a four-amino-acid-insertion at the junction of S1 and S2, not observed in other lineage 175 B beta-CoVs [18]. This insertion, which represents a poly-basic (furin) cleavage site, is 176 unique to SARS-CoV-2 and is present in all SARS-CoV-2 sequenced so far. The insertion 177 of three residues, PAA, at the junction of S1 and S2 in RmYN02 ( Figure 2H , and Figure  178 S2A for results from Sanger sequencing) is therefore of major importance. Although the 179 inserted residues (and hence nucleotides) are not the same as those in RmYN02, and 180 10 hence are indicative of an independent insertion event, that they are presented in wildlife 181 (bats) strongly suggests that they are of natural origin and have likely acquired by 182 recombination. As such, these data are strongly suggestive of a natural zoonotic origin of 183 SARS-CoV-2. 184",

Consistent with a previous research [6], the pangolin beta-CoVs 186 formed two well-supported sub-lineages, representing animal seized by anti-smuggling 187 authorities in Guangxi (Pangolin-CoV/GX) and Guangdong (Pangolin-CoV/GD) provinces 188 ( Figure 3A and Figure S4A ). However, whether pangolins are natural reservoirs for these 189 viruses, or they acquired these viruses independently from bats or other wildlife, requires 190 further sampling [6] . More notable was that RmYN02 was the closest relative of 191 SARS-CoV-2 in most of the virus genome, although these two viruses were still separated 192 from each other by a relatively long branch length ( Figure 3A and Figure S4A ). In the 193 spike gene tree, SARS-CoV-2 clustered with RaTG13 and was distant from RmYN02, 194 suggesting that the latter virus has experienced recombination in this gene ( Figure 3B and 195 Figure S4B ). In phylogeny of the RBD, SARS-CoV-2 was most closely related to 196 pangolin-CoV/GD, with the bat viruses falling in more divergent positions, again indicative 197 of recombination ( Figure 3C and Figure S4C ). Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the 198 complete RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, which is often used in the 199 phylogenetic analysis of RNA viruses, revealed that RmYN02, RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 200 formed a well-supported sub-cluster distinct from the pangolin viruses ( Figure 3D and 201 Figure S4D ). 202 11 We confirmed the bat host of RmYN02, Rhinolophus malayanus, by analyzing the 203 sequence of the cytochrome b (Cytb) gene from the next generation sequencing data; this 204 revealed 100% sequence identity to a Rhinolophus malayanus isolate (GenBank 205 accession MK900703). Both Rhinolophus malayanus and Rhinolophus affinis are widely 206 distributed in southwest China and southeast Asia. Generally, they do not migrate over 207 long distances and are highly gregarious such that they are likely to live in the same caves, 208 which might facilitate the exchange of viruses between them and the occurrence of 209 recombination. Notably, RaTG13 was identified from anal swabs and RmYN02 was 210 identified from feces, which is a simple, but feasible way for bats to spread the virus to 211 other animals, especially species that can utilize cave environments. 212",

The gaps between contigs of RmYN02 were 339 complemented by re-mapping the reads to the ends of the contigs, which produced the 340 full-length genome sequence of RmYN02. However, due to the limited number of reads 341 available, only a partial genome sequence of RmYN01 was obtained (23395 bp reading frames (ORFs) of the verified genome sequences were predicted using Geneious 354 (version 11.1.5).

We speculate that these deletions may cause conformational 151 variations and consequently reduce the binding of RmYN02 RBD with ACE2 or even 152 cause non-binding. It is possible that the bat SARS-related CoVs with loop deletions, 153 including RmYN02, ZXC21 and ZC45, use a currently unknown receptor.

As noted above, and consistent with the homology modelling, 164 pangolin/MP789/2019 possessed the identical amino acid residues to SARS-CoV-2 at all 165 six positions [6]. In contrast, both RaTG13, RmYN02 and RmYN01 possessed the same 166 amino acid residue as SARS-CoV-2 at only one of the six positions each (RaTG13, L455; 167 RmYN02, Y505; RmYN01, Y505) (Figure 2G), despite RaTG13 being the closest relative 168 in the spike protein.
