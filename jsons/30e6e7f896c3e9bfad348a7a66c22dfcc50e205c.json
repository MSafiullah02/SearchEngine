Our case is important as it demonstrates the need to differentiate between the Brugada syndrome and the Brugada-like ECG morphology.

These Brugada-like patterns usually disappear once the inciting event is removed.(3) Brugada-like ECG pattern presents an additional diagnostic and therapeutic challenge as it may be present in patients presenting with chest pain thus mimicking ST elevation. Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) that our patient developed has similarly been associated with Brugada syndrome.(4) Most recently, COVID-19 infection has been described as unmasking Brugada syndrome in a patient who presented with syncope.(5)",
