            "text": "Following the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945 from a cerebral hemorrhage secondary to longstanding uncontrolled hypertension, the problem of high blood pressure (BP) gained national attention as a health crisis for the first time [1]. Healthcare providers and researchers began to turn their attention to the detection and treatment of hypertension and the development of antihypertensive medications. The earliest medications to be approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for hypertension treatment were the alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine and the vasodilator hydralazine in 1953 (Table 1). Since then over 130 agents, many of which are available in single-pill combinations, have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of hypertension. Each of these agents uses one or more of the 17 mechanisms of action to lower BP [2]. Antihypertensive drug development and approval began in the early 1950s, peaked in the 1980s and 1990s, and decreased in the twenty-first century. Since 2011, only four antihypertensive drugs and drug combinations have been approved by the FDA, including azilsartan (Edarbi, Arbor Pharmaceuticals), azilsartan/chlorthalidone (Edarbiclor, Arbor Pharmaceuticals), perindopril/amlodipine (Prestalia, Marina Biotech), and most recently nebivolol/valsartan (Byvalson, Allergan) in 2016 [2]. In this review, we discuss new drugs and drug combinations that have undergone preclinical or clinical testing for the treatment of hypertension and its comorbidities since our previous review of the topic in 2015 [3\u2022\u2022].",

Similarly, other major guideline writing committees in Canada, Australia, and Europe have concluded that the SBP target for antihypertensive drug treatment in adults with hypertension and high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk should be lower than previously recommended [6\u20138]. Achieving these aggressive treatment goals will likely be a daunting task since approximately 50% of hypertensive patients are now uncontrolled to the traditional target of < 140/90 mmHg.",

            "text": "Failure to achieve BP control is often due to non-adherence to prescribed medication regimens [9]. Of all patients treated for hypertension, 40% stopped their regimen within 2 years of initiation and 61% stopped by 10 years [10]. In 2017, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported that one in five prescriptions is never filled and 50% that are filled are not taken properly [11]. Based on these data, it is apparent that a large gap exists between current treatment guidelines and long-term, successful BP control in the majority of patients. For these reasons, much of the ongoing research and development in hypertension treatment is dedicated to developing fixed-dose combination drugs, allowing for better BP control by improving adherence to medications. Recent research has been directed toward improving adherence by combining two or more antihypertensive agents and combining antihypertensive medications with medicines that treat comorbidities such as hyperlipidemia [12]. Currently, 16 fixed-dose combination medications are in ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of hypertension and related comorbidities [12] (Table 2). Each of these contains at least one FDA-approved antihypertensive medication and four combinations contain three or more agents. The majority of these are combinations of an ACE inhibitor or an ARB with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) and/or thiazide diuretic.",

Multiple phase III clinical trials of Tripliam have been completed, and it is currently in a phase IV study. The Perindopril-Indapamide plus AmlodipiNe in high rISk hypertensive patients (PIANIST) trial evaluated the BP lowering effect of the perindopril-amlodipine-indapamide combination in 4731 patients with difficult to treat hypertension who were high-risk for CVD and were uncontrolled on their current regimen, which included a wide range of antihypertensives [13]. The three-drug combination reduced office BP significantly from a baseline mean of 160/93 mmHg to a treatment mean of 132/80 mmHg and also significantly reduced ambulatory BP (ABP). In another study, similar reductions in 24 h ABP, daytime and nighttime BP, and pulse pressure were shown with the fixed-dose triple combination compared to the same three individual \u201cfree\u201d anti-hypertensive medications after 1 month of treatment [14]. The Once-daily Fixed combiNation vErsus freE-drug cOmbination of Three aNtihypertensive Agents in arteriaL hYpertension (ONE & ONLY) trial randomized 305 patients to receive either a fixed-dose combination of perindopril-indapamide-amlodipine-atorvastatin or a free-drug combination of perindopril, indapamide, and amlodipine with atorvastatin [15]. The study demonstrated that Tripliam significantly increased adherence and reduced SBP without increasing costs compared to the free-drug group. No significant difference in LDL lowering was found between the groups, though the fixed-dose combination group experienced greater CVD risk reduction overall.",

Subsequent studies found that Micatrio is more effective at lowering SBP and DBP compared to telmisartan and amlodipine combined. The Telmisartan/Amlodipine+Hydrochlorothiazide Versus Telmisartan/Amlodipine Combination Therapy for Essential Hypertension Uncontrolled With Telmisartan/Amlodipine (TAHYTI) trial was a randomized controlled trial of 310 patients that showed that addition of hydrochlorothiazide to telmisartan and amlodipine resulted in a clinically significant 12.3/8.4 mmHg reduction in office BP compared to telmisartan/amlodipine [17]. Another study revealed that the three-drug combination produced a significantly greater reduction in SBP (\u2212 5.3 mmHg difference) when adjusted for baseline BP compared to telmisartan-amlodipine [18].

However, the olmesartan group required more add-on therapy with either amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide to achieve the same BP reduction. The Efficacy and Safety of Crystalline Valsartan/Sacubitril (LCZ696) Compared With Placebo and Combinations of Free Valsartan and Sacubitril in Patients With Systolic Hypertension (RATIO) study examined the effectiveness of Entresto in reducing clinic sitting SBP compared to sacubitril and valsartan monotherapy [29]. Entresto produced significantly greater reductions in office BP, pulse pressure, and all secondary end-points (24 h mean BP, pulse pressure, mean daytime and nighttime ABP).",

            "text": "Polypill is a general term used to describe a fixed-dose combination pill (FDCP) with multiple therapeutic targets. The polypill was first proposed for the primary prevention of CVD in 2003 by Wald and Law as a combination of a statin, thiazide diuretic, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, folic acid, and aspirin [30]. Since that time, various polypills have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials for safety, efficacy, adherence, and cost and is now approved for use in over 30 countries [31, 32, 33\u2022\u2022, 34, 35]. Polypills have been shown to increase patient adherence by reducing a patient\u2019s pill burden, thus improving BP control [31]. Most polypill formulations are comprised of a statin and one or two antihypertensives with or without aspirin, though other formulations, such as atorvastatin, aspirin, and clopidogrel, have been proposed for chronic heart disease [36]. Globally, the prevention and treatment of CVD have advanced to the forefront of healthcare policy in recent years, thereby creating a new push for use of polypills [37]. Recently, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-3 (HOPE-3) trial showed an overall benefit of a multi-target FDCP consisting of rosuvastatin, candesartan, and hydrochlorothiazide compared to placebo in primary prevention for those at intermediate risk of CVD [38]. This FDCP has also been suggested as a primary and secondary prevention strategy for cerebrovascular disease [39]. Multiple studies have assessed the potential cost-effectiveness of polypills and have found them to be more cost-effective than the simultaneous use of each individual agent [32, 40]. There are many ongoing clinical trials of polypills worldwide, indicating continued interest and acknowledgement of their potential for improved public health globally. However, to date, polypills have struggled to gain widespread use because of low pharmaceutical interest, clinician concern, and a lack of advocacy for multi-target FDCPs [41\u2022, 42].",

The authors suggested that a better understanding of RAS effects in ARDS and of rhACE2 effects in pulmonary mechanics is needed if rhACE2 is to be further developed for this indication. Given the promising results from preclinical studies, it has been suggested that rhACE2 may be a reasonable candidate for the future treatment of HF due to its ability to decrease Ang II levels and protect against cardiac hypertrophy, remodeling, and fibrosis [62].

Early studies in animal models revealed favorable effects on BP in hypertensive subjects and on components of the metabolic syndrome such as glycemic control and lipid profiles by increasing insulin sensitivity and decreasing oxidative stress [63, 64\u2022]. Later studies suggested a beneficial effect of Ang (1-7) in rodent models of hypertension, cardiac remodeling, HF, and kidney disease via inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis/pathologic remodeling [65\u201369]. Ang (1-7) has especially promising effects in preventing progression of HF, a highly prevalent complication of hypertension [67, 70\u201372]. Due to the short half-life in vivo, conducting clinical studies with Ang (1-7) has been difficult. Only recently have multiple phase I clinical trials begun to evaluate the effects of Ang (1-7) on BP, the metabolic syndrome, and other CV parameters. Completion of these studies is expected by 2018 year-end [12].",

Aminopeptidase A (APA) converts Ang II to Ang III in brain by removing the N-terminal aspartic acid residue. Ang III in brain increases sympathetic nervous system activity and causes release of arginine vasopressin, thereby raising BP. Thus, APA has gained interest as a potential target for antihypertensive therapy. The APA dimer RB150 has been developed as an orally active APA inhibitor that crosses the blood brain barrier to inhibit APA in hypertensive rats. RB150 given orally to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) has been shown to inhibit formation of Ang III in brain and lower BP in a dose dependent fashion by decreasing sympathetic tone and vascular resistance [86, 87]. RB150 was found to work synergistically with enalapril to reduce BP in that study. Chronic treatment with RB150 has also been shown to reduce BP and plasma arginine vasopressin levels in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats [88]. RB150 was patented by Quantum Genomics and was renamed QGC001. QGC001 was well tolerated in phase I studies evaluating its efficacy and tolerability as a potential hypertension treatment [89]. The QUID-HF study is an ongoing multinational phase II trial comparing QGC001 to placebo in patients with NYHA class II-III HF. The primary outcomes are changes in NT-proBNP and BP, and results are expected later this year. QGC001 has recently been renamed FIRIBASTAT and is currently being investigated as a treatment for hypertension in a larger phase IIa trial, NEW-HOPE [12].",

Blockade of the L-type calcium channel with calcium channel blockers effectively lowers BP in hypertensive subjects. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor and mediator of inflammation when activating its type A and type B2 receptors. In contrast, ET-1 has vasodilator and anti-inflammatory effects mediated by its B1 receptor. Recently, a dual L-type calcium channel blocker/ET A/B2 antagonist, sargachromenol-D, was isolated from Sargassum siliquastrum, a marine brown alga [98]. Sargachromenol-D was shown to reduce ET-1 and K+ depolarization-induced vasoconstriction in basilar arteries of rabbits and to reduce BP in rodent models of hypertension. Further studies are needed to assess the potential role of sargachromenol-D in the treatment of human hypertension.",

Activation of cSRC over time can cause hypertension and HF, and ouabain has been shown to increase vascular resistance, leading to hypertension in rodent models [100]. Thus, ouabain inhibitors have been considered as potential therapies for hypertension and CVD. Rostafuroxin, which was developed to antagonize the action of ouabain on Na+/K+ ATPase, has been shown to lower SBP, facilitate endothelium-mediated vascular relaxation, increase nitric oxide production, and reduce oxidative stress in resistance arteries from DOCA-salt hypertensive rats [101]. Further investigation is needed to explore the role of rostafuroxin as a potential treatment for hypertension in humans.",

Most recently, two vaccines, ATRQ\u00df-001 and ATR12181, have revived the possibility of vaccine treatments for hypertension. Both contain peptides isolated from the AT1R attached to a virus-like particle in order to stimulate production of antibodies to the AT1R [104, 105]. Both vaccines reduced BP and resulted in favorable vascular remodeling and regression of CV complications when compared to controls in rodent models of hypertension [104]. ATRQ\u00df-001 also lowered BP and prevented streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy in a rodent model [106]. These newer antihypertensive vaccines have yet to be evaluated in clinical trials, but offer the potential advantage of not requiring daily dosing to effectively lower BP in hypertensive patients, thus improving treatment adherence and BP control rates in the population.",
