As part 63 of necessary pandemic planning, the majority of Canadian cardiac surgical programs have 64 prioritized and delayed elective procedures in an effort to reduce the burden on the health care 65 system and to mobilize resources in the event of a pandemic surge. While the number of 66 COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide, new cases have begun to decline in many 67 jurisdictions. This \"flattening of the curve\" has inevitably prompted discussions around re-68 opening of the economy, relaxing some public health restrictions and resuming non-urgent health 69 care delivery. 70",

First, all 74 recommendations from public health authorities regarding COVID-19 containment must 75 continue to be followed to minimize disease spread, ensure patient safety, and protect health care 76 personnel. Second, patients awaiting elective cardiac surgery need to be proactively managed, 77 reprioritizing those with high risk anatomy or whose clinical status is deteriorating. Finally, case 78 volumes should be steadily increased in a mutually agreed upon fashion and must balance the 79 clinical needs of patients awaiting surgery against the overall requirements of the health care The notion of ramping up, though, is a sensitive subject. While there is a desire to re-establish 94 what society once knew as being normal, there is a reluctance to return to \"business as usual\". 95",

            "text": "Cardiac surgical programs face a similar predicament. On one hand, significant efforts have 96 been made by cardiac surgery teams to prioritize and delay elective cardiac surgery cases so that 97 health care resources, in particular critical care resources, may be liberated in order to treat those 98 most severely affected by COVID-19. On the other hand, there is growing concern about the 99 increased risk that patients with surgical cardiac disease face by being asked to wait indefinitely 100 for their life-saving procedure. 101 102 As such, decisions to re-expand surgical case volume will require thoughtful and appropriate 103 caution as we navigate through this global pandemic. There will be a need to make collaborative 104 decisions, all the while maintaining the awareness and flexibility needed to readjust our 105 escalation strategy in response to new and emerging data. It is with this in mind that the CSCS 106 has proposed the following guiding statements. Based on the expert opinions of cardiac surgical 107 and critical care leaders from across Canada, these guiding statements provide a template 8 whereby cardiac surgical programs may increase cardiac care in a deliberate and graded fashion 109 as the COVID-19 pandemic burden begins to ease. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced challenges that cardiac surgical programs have never 207 experienced before. Elective cases have been scaled back, restricting programs to urgent and 208 emergent cases so that resources may be mobilized to care for patients with COVID-19. Wait 209 lists have grown, and those being asked to wait for surgery may be forced to experience 210 excessively prolonged wait times. In an effort to mitigate this, patients who were once deemed 211 surgical candidates have increasingly been referred for medical management or alternative 212 percutaneous therapies. Despite this, there remains a significant number of patients in whom 213 timely surgical intervention, even if during a global pandemic, outweighs the risk of further 214 delay. 215 216 It is with this in mind that the CSCS has postulated the aforementioned guiding statements in an 217 effort to support cardiac surgical programs across Canada and to provide them with a template 218 upon which to formulate their plans to ramp up. As new data emerges, these guiding statements 219 may change over time given the fluidity and scope of the current pandemic. Geographic 13 differences in epidemiology and practice patterns across Canada must be acknowledged, and we 221 hope that these guiding statements will allow for the deliberate and graded increase in cardiac 222 surgical care as the COVID-19 pandemic burden begins to ease.

To 113 this effect, cardiac surgical programs must continue to respect and enforce the 114 precautions and guidelines that have been put in place by their respective institutions and 115 by the public health authorities at all levels of government to manage and contain 116 COVID-19, limit the risk of nosocomial infection, ensure patient safety, and protect 117 health care personnel. These include, but are not limited to, hand hygiene, the use of 118 personal protective equipment (PPE), the creation of COVID-free units, social distancing, 119 self-isolation, and travel restrictions. 120 121 2. Comprehensive screening procedures to identify patients at increased risk for COVID-19 122 should continue to be respected and enforced as cardiac surgical programs begin to ramp 123 up. These include the following: 124 a. Standardized clinical screening questionnaires prior to admission to the hospital, 125ideally via telephone, focusing on the clinical history of patients and their co-126 habitants (including viral-like symptoms compatible with COVID-19) 127 b. Initial admission to an isolation room within the hospital where additional 128 screening and/or testing may be performed as needed.9 c. Once admitted to the ward, daily clinical screening of patients to elicit signs and 130 symptoms of viral illness and identify patients who may have been in the 131 incubation or pre-symptomatic phase of infection on admission 132 133 3. The validity of COVID-19 testing has been the source of significant debate, and there is 134 presently no test available that can reliably rule out COVID-19, particularly in the 135 absence of symptoms. Despite this, nasopharyngeal swab testing for COVID-19, 136 including rapid molecular tests, are being performed routinely across Canada with many 137 centres having the ability to obtain test results within hours. To this effect, the CSCS 138 provides the following guidance to COVID-19 test interpretation in the ramp up phase 139 based on best available evidence at time of writing. 140 a. Nasopharyngeal swab testing for COVID-19 has a diminished sensitivity with 141 false negative rates between 26-100%. 2 Clinical sensitivity is reduced due to poor 142 quality specimen collection 3 , timing of collection as it relates to an exposure or 143 the onset of symptoms (higher false negative rates have been noted in the 144 asymptomatic or pre-clinical period) 2 , or the presence of more advanced disease 145 at which time the virus may be more localized to the lung as opposed to the 146 nasopharynx. 4 147 b. Patients with negative molecular testing in whom the clinical suspicion of 148 COVID-19 infection remains high should stay in isolation per the guidance of 149 institutional infection control practitioners. Additional investigative tools that 150may be considered to help confirm the diagnosis of COVID-testing for serologic immunity becomes more readily available, patients should 154 be screened for antibodies, if possible, to assess for immunity secondary the protracted nature of this pandemic, cardiac surgery programs must continue to 158 proactively manage EVERY patient on their wait list despite re-expansion of case 159 volumes. Aspects of this management may include, but are not limited to, the following: 160 a. All waitlist patients must be contacted via telephone, teleconference or 161 videoconference at least every 2 to 4 weeks so that their clinical status may be 162 assessed and reassessed on a regular basis. 163 b. Each centre must have a clear mechanism in place to formally assess patients with 164 deteriorating symptoms, unstable clinical characteristics or high-risk anatomy and 165 to order any non-invasive tests as needed. 166 c. Peer review with other members of the heart team is highly encouraged Efforts to ramp up must be done within the local context of the pandemic, as a careful 170 balance must be struck between the clinical needs of patients awaiting cardiac surgery, 171 risk of nosocomial infection and the overall resource requirements of the health care 172 system. Any intention to escalate or re-escalate cardiac surgical volumes requires regular 11 administration, provincial department of health and/or public health officials. This 175 communication should occur frequently, with consideration given to daily meetings if 176 feasible. Ideally, a provincial dashboard that provides a real-time trend of resource 177 utilization (e.g. hospital admissions, ICU admissions, ventilator use, PPE availability) 178should be created to facilitate forecasting, communication and rapid decision making. 179 180 6. When ramping up, the CSCS proposes a phased implementation approach that is based 181 upon what phase your hospital is at with respect to its re-expansion or increase in hospital 182 capacity (Figure 2). We have defined increase in hospital capacity as the percentage of 183 resources previously allocated to the COVID-19 pandemic that have now been 184 reallocated to the management of non-COVID-19 patients. Phase 1 reflects a 0-25% 185 increase in capacity, Phase 2 a 25%-50% increase and Phase 3 a 50%-100% increase, or a 186 return to normal or near-normal institutional activity. Depending on which phase of re-187 expansion your institution is currently in, your cardiac surgical program will have a 188 defined approach to which elective cases will be given priority during the ramp up 189 (Figure 2). As far as the number of electives cases by which your program may ramp up 190 are concerned, this will depend upon the urgent case demands at your institution and your 191 overall institutional capacity. It should be noted that recently published ISCHEMIA trial5  192    supports the role of optimal medical therapy as first-line therapy in appropriately selected 193 patients with stable coronary artery disease, thus allowing for the deferral of surgical 194 revascularization in this patient population. It should also be noted that urgent case 195 demands may increase as the result of of having reduced or eliminated elective cardiac 196 care services during the COVID-19 pandemic at your institution, which, in turnsurgical programs must be prepared to immediately stop ramping up or to even 201 de-escalate cardiac surgical volumes should there be a resurgence in the number of 202 COVID-19 cases or COVID-19-related admissions and deaths.",
