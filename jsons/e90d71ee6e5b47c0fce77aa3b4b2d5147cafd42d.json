Intra-alveolar multinucleated giant cells, smudge cells and vascular thrombosis were present. The diagnosis was confirmed by reverse realtime PCR assay on a throat swab sample taken during the patient's admission. The positive result was reported fifteen days subsequent to autopsy.",

In 2018 he had been diagnosed with low grade, non-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. On admission he had neither hypertension nor diabetes mellitus. A chest X-ray revealed a bilateral interstitial infiltrate with a ground glass appearance involving the inferior lobes ( fig 1A) . A CT angiogram ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism. Antibiotic treatment with Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone was initiated but with no clinical improvement. As viral pneumonia was suspected, he underwent a panel of tests for respiratory viruses, all of which proved negative for: Influenza Due to his poor evolution, he was transferred to the ICU on the 13 th of February, 2020, where he died four hours later in shock with renal failure unresponsive to treatment.",
