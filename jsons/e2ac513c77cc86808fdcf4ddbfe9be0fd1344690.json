The AstV genome includes three open reading frames (ORFs) designated ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. ORF1a and ORF1b situated at the 5 0 end of the genome encode non-structural polyproteins including a protease and a RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) .

The family Astroviridae is currently divided in two genera; strains of the genus Mamastrovirus are found in infected mammals and strains of the genus Avastrovirus are found in avian hosts (Monroe, 2005) . According to the latest ICTV report, Knowledge of porcine astrovirus diversity and epidemiology remains limited. We used a broad range PCR approach to investigate the presence and diversity of astroviruses in healthy pigs of different ages on 20 farms and in 3 slaughterhouses situated in the province of Quebec, Canada between 2005 and 2007. Our study unexpectedly revealed remarkable levels of genetic diversity and high prevalence of astroviruses in pigs of this province. Astroviruses were detected on every farm investigated and in all age groups of pigs, from suckling piglets to adults. In addition, we found that nearly 80% of healthy finisher pigs harbour astroviruses in their intestine at slaughter. Phylogenetic evidence based on partial polymerase and complete capsid sequences, suggests that porcine astroviruses do not form a monophyletic group but are rather found on separate branches across the mamastrovirus tree. In addition to type species strains, we found highly divergent strains that form two additional lineages, one of which falls outside existing taxonomic groups. The presence of diverse astroviruses in a majority of healthy pigs likely represents a continuous source of infection to piglets and possibly to other animal species including humans. Porcine astrovirus strains appeared phylogenetically related not only to prototypical human astroviruses, as was already known, but also to novel human strains recently discovered suggesting multiple cross species transmission events between these hosts and other animal species. Overall, the findings reported in this study suggest an active role of pigs in the evolution and ecology of the Astroviridae.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 225, "text": "(Monroe, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 226, "end": 248, "text": "Jonassen et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 249, "end": 266, "text": "Zhu et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 267, "end": 287, "text": "Rivera et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 288, "end": 308, "text": "Atkins et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 309, "end": 329, "text": "Toffan et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 520, "end": 534, "text": "(Monroe, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Crown Copyright \u00df 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A remarkable and surprising diversity of AstVs was disclosed in these hosts.

Pairwise amino acid identities between strains within each of these lineages range from only 23% to 31%, which is comparable to distances between established AstV species. Porcine strains belonging to two of the lineages (group I and III) were more closely related to other animal's AstV strains than they were to each other suggesting different ancestral origin of porcine AstVs and past interspecies transmission involving sheep, mink, felines, humans and possibly additional yet unknown hosts. Likewise, a number of novel human AstV strains were recently shown to be genetically closer to animal AstVs strains and more distantly related to type HuAstV species suggesting different origins (Finkbeiner et al., 2008; Kapoor et al., 2009 ). In addition, Chu et al. (2008) and Zhu et al. (2009) have also shown that AstVs isolated from the same species of bats cluster in different groups following phylogenetic reconstruction.
