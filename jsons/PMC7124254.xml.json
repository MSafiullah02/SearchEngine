In aggregate, weight, crown-to-rump length, level of hair growth and its texture, and the presence or absence of erupted teeth will help define gestational age.",

This is a normal anatomic structure known as the marginal or perizonal hematoma. This structure is much narrower and less distinct in cats and is pale brown. Any abnormalities in the placenta should be noted and a sample collected for histopathology. An impression smear of the chorioallantois should be obtained in order to examine for evidence of inflammatory cells and/or bacterial organisms. Brucella organisms are particularly evident within placental impression smears, allowing for rapid diagnosis.

In cats, herpesviral infection as a cause of abortion is extremely rare and is most often associated with respiratory disease in the queen rather than direct infection of the fetus.13 As in dogs, neonatal death due to herpesvirus can be seen in kittens.10 For more information on herpesviral infection in dogs, please see article by Decaro and colleagues elsewhere in this issue.",

            "text": "The two most common causes of bacterial abortion and neonatal death in dogs are Brucella canis and Streptococcus spp infection.3, 21, 22, 23, 24 Additional information on these organisms is provided in article by Graham and Taylor elsewhere in this issue. Infection with other bacterial organisms, such as Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp, Leptospira spp, and Salmonella spp can occur sporadically.3, 25, 26, 27 Most bacterial causes of abortion and neonatal death will be isolated during routine aerobic cultures.26 Although Brucella spp will grow on routine blood agar plates, colonies often take several days to become visible. Because of this, routine cultures that are reported as \u201cno growth\u201d at 48 hours have not ruled out brucellosis. Other exceptions include Salmonella spp and Campylobacter spp, both of which require special culture techniques. Leptospira spp are extremely difficult to culture, and growth can take several weeks. Paired serology on blood from the bitch or queen is a rapid diagnostic tool for leptospirosis. It is important to remember that recent vaccination of the dam may interfere with serologic interpretation. Histopathology is recommended to confirm that the organisms isolated from routine bacterial cultures are indeed associated with an infectious process and not a contaminant. This is particularly true concerning isolates from the placentas it is often contaminated by feces and other material that may be present in the birthing area. Bacterial causes of abortion in cats are similar to those in dogs, with the exception of brucellosis.13, 17, 28, 29 Abortions due to fungal infection are rare in dogs and cats.",
