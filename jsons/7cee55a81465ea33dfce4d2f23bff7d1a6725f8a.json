The system consists of both epidemiological and virological surveillance. It is an important tool for monitoring the situation in the entire country, coordinated by the National Influenza Center situated at the National Institute of Public Health-National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH-NIH) in Warsaw, Poland. In the 2015/2016 epidemic season, more than 1600 samples were tested in the Sentinel System, of which 38.6% were positive. The samples were evaluated in seven age-groups: 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-25, 26-44, 45-64, and over 65 years of age. Significant differences were reported in the number of confirmed cases of infection caused by influenza and influenza-like viruses, depending on the age-group. The highest number of confirmed cases of infections was reported for the age range of 26-44 years, accounting for 30% of the total. In each age-group, the presence of infection caused by influenza-like viruses, collectively accounting for only 3.8% of all positive tests, was also confirmed.

The greatest havoc in the twentieth century was brought about by Spanish influenza, caused by the virus subtype A/H1N1/, which took place in the years 1918/1919. According to the latest data, it caused about 50 million deaths and large economic losses (WHO 2004) . For this reason, the WHO launched an international influenza surveillance system in 1947. It served to observe changes in the structure of the influenza virus and to rapidly detect newly formed virus variants (\u017b yci\u0144ska and Brydak 2007) .

Thanks to the reports it was possible to react quickly and focus on preventing the spread of the virus. A quick reaction was essential because according to the latest WHO estimates, 60% of infections caused by this subtype are fatal (Brydak 2014) . In 2003, the National Center of Influenza in Rotterdam identified a different dangerous subtype of the HPAI determined as A/H7N7/ (Elbers et al. 2004) , which reaffirms the notion of the influenza virus constantly undergoing modifications. In view of this unpredictability and the virus spread in the world, National Influenza Centers have been created in many countries. By 2008, 122 such centers were in operation throughout the world (Brydak 2008) . Currently, there are 142 National Influenza Centers that act as reference centers in different countries. In Poland, this center is placed at the National Institute of Public Health-National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH-NIH). Apart from the GISRS, surveillance of influenza activity in Europe also is conducted by the European Influenza Surveillance Network (EISN), which is overseen by the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC). The EISN conducts both epidemiological and virological surveillance.
