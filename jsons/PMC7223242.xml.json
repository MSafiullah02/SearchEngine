            "text": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive degenerative macular disease attacking the region of highest visual acuity, the macula. It becomes a leading cause of irreversible blindness in people over 50 years of age especially those living in industrialized countries [1, 2]. More than 30 million people across the globe have the condition, and the incidence of AMD is expected to be on the rise over the next 40 years [3]. Recent and widely used therapy for AMD involves intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies, viz. bevacizumab (Avastin), ranibizumab (Lucentis), or anti-VEGF receptor\u2014aflibercept (Eylea) and siRNA [4\u20136]. Intravitreal injections at times may result in retinal detachment, hemorrhage, high intraocular pressure, and endophthalmitis [7]. AMD is a chronic ocular disease and thus requires long-term, repetitive dosing, sometimes extending through the entire lifetime of the patient. General frequency of administration for intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF antibodies is 4 weeks. Since the therapy is invasive and painful and requires hospitalization along with a companion, hence, it results in a significant reduction in quality of life. Moreover, injection administration by an expert will add to the complexity and cost of the therapy. All these factors contribute to a reduced patient compliance [8]. Working out a non-invasive treatment option using a suitable agent, as topical drops, is the future endeavor of scientific community for management of AMD. However, it is very difficult to achieve therapeutic drug levels in the vitreous, retina, or choroid following topical application of drugs/drug solution [8]. This is because of the unique anatomical and physiological constraints to drug delivery existing within the eye. The novel drug delivery systems like nanosized particles are now reported to reach the internal sections of the eye [9, 10] following topical application in the form of eye drops via a variety of mechanisms and uptake pathways.",

            "text": "Several epidemiological and clinical studies indicate that cardiovascular disease (CVD) and AMD have similar pathology because of their shared risk factors (including analogous aging changes in vascular intima and Bruch\u2019s membrane (BM) [11], smoking, hypertension, and serum lipid status) and genetic predisposition [12]. BM lining lying below the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the inner margin of the choriocapillaris and is considered the structural analog of the vascular intima of arteries [13]. Furthermore, protein molecular composition of drusen of the eye and arteriosclerotic plug and their modification, oxidation, and aggregation leading to CVD and/or AMD respectively are also similar [2]. Based on these observations and the pleiotropic nature of statins, statin intervention highly supported for CVD is also being assessed for application in AMD [14]. Statins possess actions far wider than their presently claimed and widely exploited cholesterol-lowering properties for which they are often prescribed [15] and are now established to show anti-inflammatory [2], anti-oxidative [16], anti-tumor [17], and immunomodulatory [18] effects. Hall et al. showed a markedly lower rate of exudative AMD among a cohort of patients on HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor (\u201cstatin\u201d) [19]. However, subsequent clinical studies show inconsistent results on the benefit of statin therapy in AMD [20\u201322]. Reasons assigned for these conflicting reports include small sample size [23], non-uniform dose among the study subjects [23, 24], and studies combining wet or dry AMD cases together. Further, it is indicated that the dose of statin is directly related to its efficiency [25]. The PROVE-IT study [26] and REVERSAL and ASTEROID trials showed benefit of aggressive over moderate-intensity dosage therapy of statins [27, 28].",

However, the large molecular mass exceeding 500 Da, poor solubility, and high first pass metabolism result in a poor oral bioavailability of only 12% [29, 30]. Existence of blood-aqueous humor or blood-retinal barrier will further restrict its availability in the ocular tissues. Insolubility (0.00495 mg/ml) and photodegradation of ATS are also serious challenges to permeability and development of ATS as ocular drops [31]. Generally single or a mixture of surfactants is required for solubilization of any insoluble entity and for its encapsulation into nanocarriers. ATS is prone to degradation, including oxidation, in surfactant solutions such as polysorbate 80, the most widely employed and effective surfactant, which also makes nanoformulation development difficult. The oxidation so caused is not reversed even upon use of anti-oxidants [32]. Hence, surfactant and solvents need to be selected carefully for formulating ATS as a solution or nanodispersion.",

Following optimization, the final formulation was characterized extensively for (i) particle size, zeta potential, size distribution, and morphology; (ii) nature of formulated SLNs using DSC, FTIR, and XRD; and (iii) stability including photostability upon storage. The system was also evaluated for parameters, viz. pH, refractive index, osmolarity, in vivo safety, and sterility, which are important considerations for an ophthalmic formulation. Ex vivo corneal permeability, ocular residence, and in vivo pharmacokinetic profile of ATS-SLNs were compared with the corresponding free drug dispersion. Fluorescein-labeled SLN system was used to confirm the capacity of SLNs to target posterior eye tissue involved in the AMD pathology. Cell line studies were used (i) to confirm the safety of formulation to corneal and retinal cell lines; and (ii) for uptake and (iii) apoptosis studies. In vivo safety was established in rabbits using acute and repeat dose toxicity studies as per Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines.",

Selection of lipid and surfactant and their concentration are thus an important consideration for development of SLNs. However, high proneness of ATS to degradation, including oxidation in surfactant solutions especially polysorbate 80 (the most commonly employed surfactant in pharmaceutical formulations), was a serious challenge to its solubilization for preparing SLNs [32]. A series of surfactants and solvents, viz. Transcutol P, propylene glycol, Poloxamer (P) 188, PEG 300, PEG 400, and PEG 600, were thus tried in the initial prescreening studies for formation of ATS-SLNs. Minimum volume of surfactant required to completely dissolve the required quantity of ATS (0.25% w/v) along with protection from oxidation and hydrolysis was taken as criteria for their selection. However, safety and biocompatibility of selected components at their employed concentrations with ocular tissues and their amenability to steam sterilization were also a consideration [66].",

To improve drug loading and entrapment efficiency, it is important that the drug is incorporated in the SLN matrix in a soluble form [67] and for that purpose, an optimized concentration of PEG 400 was employed. Among the surfactants, not only did a 4% solution of P 188 enhance the solubility of ATS by 100 times (0.04 mg/ml), but also ATS was found to be stable (7 days) in this solution; hence, it was selected as the surfactant of choice. Both P 188 and PEG 400 can help achieve small size, high loading, and significant entrapment. Both these agents are permeation enhancers [68, 69], and PEG also has a P-gp efflux\u2013inhibiting property. In addition, PEG is a surfactant-supporting polymer which is known to reduce the gelation of SLNs [61]. P 188 protects against oxidation by getting adsorbed on the surface of lipidic nanoparticles due to its large hydrophilic blocks providing barrier for free radical chain reaction [70].",

Considering our prior experience with Compritol\u00ae 888 ATO for developing SLNs for a variety of drug molecules, its ability to form stable SLNs of sufficiently small size and its biocompatibility with ocular tissue [71], it was selected presently as the lipid matrix. Soya lecithin (Phospholipon 90H) was used as a co-surfactant and its addition improved the entrapment efficiency and stability of ATS-SLNs [72]. It is reported that oxidative stress is the initial pathological mechanism in the development of AMD which leads to oxidation of phospholipids present in the photoreceptors [73]. Excess accumulation of oxidized phosphatidylcholine was observed in immunohistochemistry of the eyes with AMD [13]. Hence, it is proposed that the anti-oxidant nature [74] of P 90H (i) will help in reducing the oxidative stress of AMD eyes and (ii) may also restore the level of unoxidized phospholipid in the photoreceptors.",

The particle size was found to decrease with the increase in Compritol\u00ae 888 ATO/P 90H ratio from 0.5 to 2.5. Beyond 2.5, SLNs of higher particle size were observed as shown in Fig. 1a. This increase in particle size beyond a certain lipid concentration is probably due to an increase in viscosity of developed system resulting in agglomeration of particles [77]. Increase in the P 188/PEG400 ratio resulted in a decrease in particle size up to mid-level and after that, particle size increased. Similar concentration-dependent surfactant and co-surfactant effect of P 188 on particle size of paclitaxel-loaded polymeric nanoparticles has been reported [58]. It seems that the hydrophobic propylene chain of P 188 aligns on the lipid/water interface along with PEG and P90H to cover the melted lipid droplets more efficiently, thus reducing the interfacial tension at the lipid\u2013water interface, resulting in a lower particle size. Further, P 188 may also offer steric stabilization to formed particles, thus avoiding their aggregation. However, as the concentration of P 188 increases beyond a certain level (3.25% in this case), the hydrophilic (PEG) chains of one particle of P 188 may interact with those of the other particles. These inter-particle interactions can result in agglomeration at higher concentrations [78].",

Compritol\u00ae 888 ATO is a complex lipid composed of mixtures of mono-, di-, and triglycerides which form less perfect crystals, and thus accord space to accommodate drug molecules [79]. P 90H is also reported to create space for drug incorporation, and the monomolecular P 90H layer stabilizes the particle interface [80]. A decrease in percentage EE at a high ratio of Compritol\u00ae 888 ATO/P 90H can be attributed to the availability of a lesser quantity of P 90H with respect to Compritol\u00ae 888 ATO.",

PEG 400 has a high affinity for water and since ATS had a very high solubility (56 mg/ml versus 0.00495 mg/ml in water) in PEG 400, hence at a high P 188/PEG400 ratio, the proportion of PEG 400 being small will partition towards water-carrying ATS with it resulting in its low entrapment in the lipid matrix [81].",

For each of these test runs, the experimentally determined response was compared with the response predicted by the mathematical model.

The PDI < 0.3 indicates a narrow particle size distribution. Small size offers a greater surface area for association and permeation through the cornea and conjunctiva [83]. Ample evidence of achieving therapeutic concentration of actives in the posterior eye tissue (including the retina) using these systems is indicated [84]. However, size is shown to influence the extent of absorption/permeation and disposition through the ocular static and dynamic barriers. Sakurai et al. studied the intraocular permeation efficiency of fluorescein-labeled polystyrene nanospheres of varying size (50, 200, 2000 nm). They observed that nanospheres with the particle size 200 nm could penetrate up to the retina while the particle size 2000 nm could not reach the retina and was seen in the vitreous cavity and trabecular meshwork only [85]. Similarly, uptake of PLGA particles in rabbit conjunctival epithelial cells was found to be higher for 100-nm particles in comparison with the corresponding 800-nm and 10,000-nm particles [86]. Size-dependent in vivo corneal uptake of indomethacin-loaded poly(epsilon-caprolactone) colloidal particles also indicates higher permeation of nanosized particles than microparticles after topical instillation into the albino rabbit eye [87].",

Systemic clearance via periocular blood or lymphatic circulation was indicated as a probable reason for rapid clearance of small particles [83, 89].

Further, no particles of size < 30 nm (frequency of 1.2% at 36 nm; Supplementary Fig. 2(a)) were observed.

Fitting of release data to the various mathematical models like zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, and Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas models indicated a first-order drug release (r2 = 0.986) pattern of ATS-SLNs. Higuchi release model (r2 = 0.932) was best fitted for ATS-SLNs at all the time points, indicating that drug release occurs by diffusion [92]. The latter was confirmed by the release exponent value (n) of 0.264, observed from the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas model indicating Fickian diffusion of ATS from ATS-SLNs.

The achieved autoclavability of the developed system could be due to the selected components, viz. P 188, P90H, and PEG 400. These components change their performance with temperature and hence are harmonious to steam sterilization [102]. PEG being a plasticizer increases the rigidity of the system facilitating stability to autoclaving and resists gelation [80]. Lipidic particles are established to be physically stable to autoclaving conditions. Capacity to resist change in particle size and entrapment efficiency after autoclaving is especially reported for P 188 [103] and other Phospholipon-based SLNs [35].

The longer residence of SLNs on the eye may be attributed to their mucus penetration effects. Mucus is the first protective barrier which checks entry of any foreign particles including bacteria into the eye, by entrapping them into luminal mucus layer (LML). The latter is rapidly cleared, preventing contact of such particles with the corneal epithelium. It may thus be said that mucoadhesive particles including nanoparticles will be eliminated from the eye as they are largely immobilized in the LML while mucus-penetrating particles quickly pass through the LML to reach the underlying adherent mucus which is cleared slowly. P 188\u2013based nanosized mucus-penetrating particles (MPPs) of loterprednoletabonate (LE) showed higher therapeutic drug levels in the posterior eye in comparison with conventional nanoparticles of LE [112]. Particles developed by us contain PEG 400 in addition to P 188, and both these polymers have been established as effective mucopenetrating agents [113]. Low molecular weight PEGs are especially studied for their mucus-penetrating effects [114]. P 188 (poly ethylene glycol (PEG)-poly propylene oxide (PPO)-PEG; known as pluronics) can coat lipidic particle surface by adsorption of the hydrophobic PPO segments, leaving a dense brush of uncharged, hydrophilic segments protruding from the particle surface [80]. The latter can help these particles to swim through the mucus and reach the corneal surface. Since the particles were observed on the corneal surface up to 7 h, hence, it may be said that they penetrated the mucus layer to reach and interact with the corneal surface.",

Free fluorescein solution (Fig. 10b) treatment did not show fluorescence in or near the cells. Entry of smaller SLNs (50\u2013100 nm, approx. 10% of total) through the cell membrane to reach the nuclear membrane could explain the perinuclear fluorescence. The granular pattern on the surface of the cells could be due to the bigger particles (> 100 nm; 90%) which do not permeate (Supplementary Fig. 2 particle size distribution) easily. These particles, however, either (i) may undergo erosion to smaller particles before their uptake or (ii) may release ATS which can permeate into cells in association with smaller particles. All particles however probably produce some permeability changes. This fact is supported by an enhanced UV-induced apoptosis (as discussed subsequently in the apoptosis study) observed with blank SLNs.",

However, the effect was completely abrogated and there was a trend (even if not significant) of ATS-SLNs to counteract the toxic effect of UV. Free ATS (ATS-SUS) did not show any effect both on viability and on apoptosis (Fig. 12). UV-irradiated RCE cells showed a viability loss of about 85% with respect to non-irradiated cells, while no differences were seen following treatments (data not shown).

SLNs probably produce some permeability changes in ARPE-19 cells, which enhance UV-induced apoptosis. It is reported that opening of permeability transition pore (PTP) in a mitochondrial cell membrane leads to apoptosis [115]. Induced apoptotic effect is however counteracted in the ATS-SLN group.

Similarly, 3.0-fold and 11.7-fold higher effects in vitreous humor were observed for Cmax and AUC, respectively. Significantly higher ocular delivery potential of ATS-SLNs in comparison with free ATS may be attributed to improved transcorneal and conjunctival uptake of ATS-SLNs because of their nanosize and penetration enhancing effect of Compritol\u00ae 888 ATO and P 188 [69]. Conjunctival pathway is now identified as the key pathway for posterior eye delivery [52]. Prolonged precorneal retention, mucus penetration and improved permeation, and probable p-gp efflux inhibition due to the presence of PEG 400 and P 188 in the ATS-SLNs are the several reasons assigned to improved ocular bioavailability observed with the latter.

Early Tmax of ATS-SUS may be due to the strong mucoadhesive nature of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose used as suspending/dispersing agent and the intrinsic lipophilic nature of ATS (log P = 4.41).

T1/2 of ATS in plasma is reported to be 14 h. However, ATS-SUS exhibited a T1/2 of 2.6 h and 4.7 h respectively in aqueous and vitreous humor. Anti-fungals like ketoconazole, fluconazole, and amphotericin B are also reported to show a higher T1/2 in plasma versus that exhibited in ocular fluids (as the T1/2 depends on the dose, dosage form, and route of administration) [121]. However, the T1/2 was significantly increased (by 3\u20134 times) to 9.2 and 14.4 h in aqueous and vitreous humor, respectively, following administration of ATS as ATS-SLNs. Furthermore, a sustained concentration of about 250 ng was maintained in the vitreous humor from 12 to 48 h while the value was negligibly low at \u2265 6 h with ATS-SUS. Since the macula is the major target for control of AMD, hence, higher and better sustained concentration of ATS in vitreous following topical application of ATS-SLNs is a highly promising indication. Vitreous humor is formed and removed at a much slower rate (0.45 \u03bcg/day) than aqueous humor (2.4 \u00b1 0.6 \u03bcl/min), such that it may be assumed that the limiting step for any drug delivery system is to reach the vitreous humor and once that is achieved, it may accumulate in the vitreous humor to a larger extent than in the aqueous humor [51]. However, viscous nature of the vitreous humor can at times limit the access of the carrier system to the posterior part of the eye including the retina and macula. SLNs prepared by us comprise PEG and P 188, both of which are expected to help these SLNs to stream through the vitreous humor due to their neutral surface and mucus-penetrating nature [112].",

For lipophilic drugs, it is indicated that only one-third of the drug in plasma can reach the aqueous and vitreous humor of the eye. Based on this, not more than or equal to 30 ng/ml of ATS is expected to reach the ocular fluids following its oral administration. In contrast, topical administration of 150 \u03bcl (equivalent to 375 \u03bcg ATS) of ATS-SLNs administered presently to rabbits achieved 1430 ng/ml of ATS in vitreous humor and 1110 ng/ml in aqueous humor which is around 30 times higher than the reported plasma concentrations or 48 times more than the expected ocular concentration. Localized concentration of ATS in vitreous humor will ensure minimal systemic side effects, viz. constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain associated with use of ATS. Furthermore, incidence of severe rhabdomyolysis (which at times may be fatal) in a significant patient population leads to discontinuation of oral ATS therapy. Such side effects will be significantly reduced while better therapeutics will be achieved following ocular application of ATS-SLNs.",

Presence of intact particles observed in the sclera, cornea, retina, and vitreous humor indicates that transport of developed SLNs occurs not only through corneal pathways (Fig. 14) but also via conjunctival/scleral route due to their small size and charge free surface. Higher permeation of ATS-SLNs may also be attributed to PEG-modified surface (both PEG 400 and PEG blocks of P 188) of developed SLNs. The latter have a capability to solubilize cell membrane due to their solubility in both polar and non-polar materials [107]. Presence of ATS-SLNs (even after 6 h) at precorneal site (Fig. 9) indicates their prolonged retention and/or mucus-penetrating nature. Presence of SLNs in the STF withdrawn by washing the rabbit corneal surface may be attributed to the forced blinking (5\u20136) of the rabbit eye induced by us prior to each sampling point, as this will detach the mucus entangled particles adhering to the corneal surface. Longer retention of presently developed nanosystem was also confirmed by presence of significant fluorescence in the cornea even after 2 h of administration (Fig. 15). Furthermore, the capacity of developed SLNs to reach the vitreous humor, retina, and RPE in intact form (as seen from fluorescence and confocal microscopy) is complemented with higher achieved therapeutic concentration of ATS (as seen from vitreous pharmacokinetic study). Cellular uptake of these particles was also confirmed in the in vitro studies (Fig. 10).",

Presence of developed F-SLN intact and/or higher diffuse fluorescence in the posterior eye including the retina following topical administration as drops, gives the direct evidence of their efficient target ability. Thus, the presently developed SLN system has special application for treatment of posterior eye diseases including AMD and diabetic retinopathy which are otherwise catered to by the invasive routes of administration of the active. The painful therapy compromises the quality of life of patients and may lead to depression. Therefore, availability of non-invasive treatment option is an unmet clinical need of high relevance for these posterior eye diseases. Presently reported system has a versatility to incorporate any other active of significance to the posterior eye.",
