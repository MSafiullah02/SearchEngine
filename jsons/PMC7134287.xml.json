Figure 1 indicates that the benefits department was the scope-of-interest. Furthermore, multiple actor roles may be involved (indicated as rectangles), acting as an initiator (when linked to a solid line) or an executor (when linked to a solid line that ends in a filled diamond). Actor roles interact with one another via several transaction kinds (TKs). Figure 1 includes two TKs, namely T01 (claim evaluation) and T02 (claim payment). The diamond-disc representation of the TK indicates that every TK consists of a production act/fact (represented by a diamond) and multiple coordination acts/facts (represented by a disc). The actor roles are either classified as elementary or composite. An elementary actor role (indicated by a white rectangle) is the executor of only one TK, as exemplified by the evaluator in Fig. 1. A composite actor role, indicated by a grey-shaded rectangle, is the executor of more than one TK. By default, actor roles that are outside the scope-of-interest, are modelled as composite actor roles [6]. Therefore, Fig. 1 indicates that the broker and finance department are composite actor roles. The actor role within the scope-of-interest (i.e. the evaluator) may need to have access to production facts and coordination facts that are produced outside the scope-of-interest. Figure 1 indicates that the evaluator needs information access (indicated with a dotted line) to an in-house software system facts, i.e. production and coordination facts that are produced outside the scope-of-interest.\n",

The functional requirements were primarily derived via the SCM. The participant-observer applied the 10-step SCM (see [5]) to extract the existing operational activities from enterprise participants. We shortly discuss an application of the 10-step method and also indicate two extensions for Step 1 and Step 10.Step 1: Inquire from a colleague to explain a short process (about 10 to 15 activities) that s/he is involved with. Figure 3 illustrates the main output of Step 1. The participant-observer extended this step, also mapping out the process represented in Fig. 3 to a business process model, using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) specification (see [16]). The extension allowed for critical analysis of the existing process, highlighting inefficient interaction between participants. Problem areas were identified, labelled (e.g. Problem A, Problem B) and described.\nStep 2: Take a picture (photo) of the process. See Fig. 3.Step 3: Discuss with your colleague all the actors that are involved and write down composite actors on yellow sticky notes, adding a smiley face, keeping actors aside. The smiley face sticky notes are illustrated on Fig. 3.\nStep 4: Explain Dietz\u2019s red-green-blue triangle of production acts, also explaining the complete transaction pattern for actor-collaboration regarding production acts. The participant observer briefly presented the concepts to the participants, only explaining the red-green-blue triangle of production acts. The complete transaction pattern was not explained, since it would be too time-consuming.Step 5: Have a discussion with your colleague as to identify original production acts from his/her process (as mapped out with sticky notes in Step 1). The discussion and classification followed.Step 6: Classify (in collaboration with your colleague) remaining acts as coordination acts vs. production acts. Additional classification was performed.Step 7: Remove the original production act notes from the flat surface and phrase appropriate transaction kind descriptions (using adjective + noun) on red sticky notes that are positioned as diamonds on your A1 paper. Collapse initial production act notes underneath re-phrased transaction kind notes. Figure 4 illustrates the re-structuring of sticky notes according to the OCD-format.Step 8: The remaining activities on your working space should be coordination acts or informational/documental production acts. Remove each of the remaining notes on your working surface and collapse them underneath the appropriate re-phrased transaction kind (red diamond notes) on your A1 paper. Figure 4 illustrates the re-structuring of sticky notes according to the OCD-format.Step 9: Position the yellow actor role notes on the A1 paper, drawing in (with a black pen) the initiator actors (+initiating links) as well as the executing actors (+executing links) to the transaction kinds, completing a composite OCD. Figure 4 illustrates the re-structuring of sticky notes according to the OCD-format.Step 10: Validate your composite OCD with your colleague. Validation was performed. The participant-observer extended this step, identifying those activities that had to be automated, using a red dot as illustrated on Fig. 4. The TK with the most red dots should be prioritized and had to form part of the same build cycle.\n",

Although light-weight agile software development approaches are favored by software development service providers, additional requirements elicitation practices should be incorporated when scaling factors apply, since design team members need to have a shared understanding of the operating context and high-level requirements. Research indicated that OCD could be useful to create a shared context for enterprise operation, linking detailed functional requirements to this shared context during software development. Although the OCD is concise, its associated concepts are abstract and an additional SCM is needed to transform existing enterprise implementations into an OCD. Since additional evaluation of the SCM was required, this study provided a real-world demonstration of the SCM within an agile software development context.",
