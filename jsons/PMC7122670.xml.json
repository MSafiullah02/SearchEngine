            "text": "World Health Organization (WHO) Risk Group (RG-) 4 pathogens are a relatively small group of high-consequence viral pathogens that can cause serious or life-threatening disease in humans or other animals and for which effective medical countermeasures (MCMs) are usually not available [1]. Handling replicative forms of these pathogens typically requires maximum (biosafety level 4 [BSL-4]) containment facilities (Table 1), of which there are only around three dozen globally [2]. Notorious examples of RG-4 pathogens include viruses that are associated with acute disease outbreaks, such as Ebola virus (EBOV) , which recently caused a human disease outbreak in Western Africa encompassing more than 28,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths [3] or Lassa virus, which in 2018 infected \u22481,500 people in Nigeria [4, 5], and viruses that cause temporally isolated small case clusters, such as Kyasanur Forest disease virus (9,594 human infections from 1957 to 2017) [6]. Several of these viruses are considered potential source material for the development of biological weapons [7, 8] and are therefore considered research priorities within national public health and biodefense programs [9, 10]. Accelerated and increasingly focused efforts to develop MCMs for the prevention and/or treatment of RG-4 pathogens are undertaken to alleviate potential community suffering and the associated socioeconomic impact.",

Cell culture has been used as a simple tool to research specific aspects of viral infection, such as screening candidate therapeutics for antiviral activity [11\u201321] or quantifying host immune responses, such as virus-neutralizing antibody titers [22, 23]. However, as current common cell culture methods cannot model the complexities of a body system, animal BSL-4 (ABSL-4) models, such as rodents or nonhuman primates, are generally used to model disease [24\u201328].",

Imaging has the advantage of being non-invasive and can detect signs of infectious disease at earlier timepoints than through clinical signs alone. Findings from qualitative radiology reports can be quantified according to standardized methods, including longitudinal image registration and organ/lesion segmentation, which measure morphological and physiological changes due to disease. However, these quantitative methods often require time consuming manual tracing of regions of interest, and tracings are subjective. Therefore, development of automated methods is needed to decrease time requirements, reduce variability, and increase accuracy, and such methods are now on the horizon.",

Since voxel values in MRI scans have arbitrary units (unlike CT scans, which are characterized by pixel values that are directly proportional to the density of the imaged tissue), parametric maps, which assign a quantity to each voxel, are created from multiple MRI sequences. Parametric maps to provide images, for example, in the form of T1 and T2 relaxometry maps [54]. These physical quantities, which represent the relaxation of proton spins in tissue, change with tissue composition. As an example, if brain edema results from a viral infection, the T1 values will increase due to the addition of fluid in the tissue. The regions delineated with \u201cfuzzy c-means clustering\u201d and \u201catlas-based registration\u201d can be directly applied to these parametric maps, and changes in disease status, such as accumulation of fluid or blood in the brain, can be predicted from abnormal findings. MRI of the brain of experimental animals will likely be exceptionally useful to refine the sequence of pathogenetic events in diseases caused by encephalitic RG-4 pathogens, such as Hendra virus, Nipah virus, or tick-borne encephalitis virus. For example, brain MRI scans of patients infected with Nipah virus have shown acute encephalitis with multiple lesions visible using T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images [55, 56]. These same MR imaging sequences performed in human studies may be performed and refined in animal models using clinical MR scanners within the BSL-4 environment.",

Therefore, segmenting liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and lymph nodes in collected images is needed to detect structural or physiologic changes. Deep learning convolutional neural networks can automatically segment multiple abdominal organs in CT and MRI modalities using the processes described above. Given this robust segmentation, radiometric features, such as texture and histogram analysis of voxels within the region of interest, can be used to classify stages of the disease process and correlate these features with clinical parameters, such as liver enzyme concentrations or virus titers. For instance, a method to quantify lung abnormalities in various disease models is now available [59]. Initially, the lungs are automatically segmented from a chest CT scan. Segmenting the lung field without any pathologic condition is done with standard image analysis methods, such as region growing, which starts with the initialization of a seed point within the region of interest and includes areas in the vicinity of the seed point based on whether the signal intensity is within a given threshold. This iterative process ends when values of neighboring voxels are not within the threshold. However, the region growing algorithm will fail in the initial lung segmentation when hyper-dense voxels in the lung are outside the threshold, requiring manual correction. Recently, an AI method was established to fully automate the lung field segmentation process when the lungs contain hyper-dense pathological areas [60]. This deep learning algorithm was trained with thousands of normal and abnormal human CT lung images to segment images of lung fields. Post-processing with morphological operators such as erosions (removal of areas) and dilations (inclusion of areas) is then needed to finalize the segmentation process. By modifying the post-processing parameters, accurate lung field segmentation was achieved in a nonhuman primate (Fig. 2), whereas the lung field was originally overestimated.",

Molecular probes, such as fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG; a marker of cellular glycolytic activity), can indicate increased cell metabolic activity in organs during infection with RG-4 pathogens [61]. Unfortunately, probes such as 18F-FDG are not entirely specific, and development of agent/disease-specific probes is urgently needed. Examples of more specific probes that have been investigated to study host responses in infectious disease imaging include PET fluorine radioisotopes such as fluoro-thymidine (18F-FLT) [62], fluorine-18 radio-labeled serum albumin (18F-albumin) [63], and 18F-N,N-diethyl-2-[4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl]-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-3-acetamide (18F-DPA)-714 [64]. 18F-FLT can be used to investigate cellular proliferation during cancers such as lymphoma or during infectious diseases. 18F-albumin can be used to detect vessel leakage. 18F-DPA-714 is a selective ligand for the translocator protein (TSPO) to investigate over-expression of activated macrophages and serves as a biomarker for neuroinflammation. This marker could prove useful in the study of disease caused by RG-4 pathogens such as Ebola virus as macrophage activation and increased vessel leakage are key pathogenic events of Ebola virus disease. In contrast to host-specific probes such as those mentioned above, probes that can attach to virions or reporter-encoding open reading frames that can be inserted into a RG-4 pathogen genome could directly localize a virus to specific areas of the body. Development of such reporter viruses has just begun. For instance, a gene encoding the solute carrier family 5 member 5 (SLC5A5, aka sodium/iodide symporter) was inserted into the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus genome (a RG-3 pathogen) and resulted in viable virus [65]. In the future, SLC5A5 and other imaging reporters could be incorporated into a variety of viral vectors to obtain in vivo visualization of location and aid in the evaluation of vaccine and therapeutic development. However, a major hurdle to overcome is virus attenuation after reporter gene insertion.",

Antibody-based methods (IHC) are severely limited by the availability of specific antibodies clones and by the conservation of the targeted epitope. Although NA-based methods, such as in situ hybridization (ISH), are ideal for identification of sequence-specific targets, these methods also have disadvantages, such as necessary signal amplification of targets, challenging experimental protocols, and complex probe design to achieve specificity and sensitivity. These disadvantages have largely been circumvented by the development of next generation ISH methods and probe design software [74\u201381]. RNAscope, an example of next-generation ISH, has been successfully implemented for the detection of RG-4 viruses (e.g., MARV, EBOV [82, 83]). RNAscope has also been used to follow single-integration events of simian immunodeficiency virus in tissues [76], demonstrating the sensitivity of the technology. Alternative enzymatic-based, virus-specific ISH has also been adapted for the surveillance of hepatitis delta virus [76, 84]. Currently, RNAscope as a method has demonstrated an ability to work on the IMC for the detection of highly abundant copies of RNA in FFPE tissues [81]. However, even with advances in these technologies, IHC- and ISH-based methods continue to suffer from the limits to the number of markers that can be examined simultaneously even if they are combined.",

To combat this limitation, researchers have begun developing chemical methods to render tissues transparent (tissue clearing), including entire adult mouse bodies following skin removal [86\u201390], and image these transparent tissues optically. For example, tissue clearing was used in combination with an antibody signal-boosting technique to produce high-resolution neuronal projection maps of adult mouse brains [91]. Additionally, these techniques were used in conjunction to detect cancer metastases in a transparent mouse and assess therapeutic antibody targeting of these cancer cells at the single-cell level [92].",

However, spectral overlap of the fluorescent marker-tagged antibodies used in flow cytometry limits simultaneous examination of a large number of cellular features. Replacing these fluorescent tags with metal ion antibody tags enabled the development of CyTOF, which overcomes traditional multiplexing limitations in blood or other dissociated cell profiling [101]. CyTOF has been applied to monitor immune responses to disease and vaccination [102]. Expanding the multiplexing capabilities of single-cell measurements offers exponential returns for profiling the complexity of immune cells [103]. Whereas flow cytometry is rarely performed with more than 12 parameters, limiting analysis to a subset of cell types or signaling readouts, CyTOF comfortably identifies 40 or more parameters on single cells. A single antibody panel can identify all major immune cell subsets in a blood sample, in addition to quantifying activation status, cytokine production, or signaling states of each of those cell types. In the case of RG-4 pathogen studies, sample volumes are frequently in limited supply as they are either sourced from rare human disease outbreaks or from the relatively few experimentally infected animals in the limited number of BSL-4 facilities. A fringe benefit of highly multiplexed technologies, including CyTOF, is that these small samples can now produce a greater number of measurements for evaluation of more hypotheses simultaneously. For instance, the gap between existing experimental and clinical data for RG-4 pathogens might be narrowed by carefully planned CyTOF studies in which rare patient samples are examined simultaneously for multiple cellular features observed in experimental models.",

To address this challenge, workflows are currently under development that will enable CyTOF analysis of virus-inactivated samples derived from RG-4 pathogen studies. A set of CyTOF reagents for direct comparison of immune system responses in humans, laboratory mice, and non-human primate animal models frequently used in RG-4 pathogens research is already available [108, 109]. Similar reagents should be considered for development of guinea pig, hamster, ferret, and other models.

In each case, multiple research groups collaborated with African partners to collect clinical samples, inactivate them with guanidinium-based reagents, extract viral RNA, reverse transcribe RNA to cDNA, and sequence by mNGS. In these cases, as specific causal pathogens were suspected, it was possible to perform multiplex PCR to enrich (concentrate) EBOV or LASV content and then to sequence on the universal serial bus (USB)-sized Oxford Nanopore minION device in the field [120]. In contrast, other groups have used non-targeted amplification methods [126], which can reveal intriguing co-infection dynamics between pathogens of interest and other pathogens that would normally be removed by the enrichment process (e.g., EBOV and Plasmodium [135] or EBOV and GB virus C [136]).",

Enzymes that cleave specific NA features or chemicals that modify specific bases can terminate reverse transcription or produce errors at structured regions [150] or biomarkers [151, 152] that are sensitively and accurately quantified by NGS. Though evaluation of NA features of RG-4 pathogens have been less frequent, these studies can be very informative. One study used NGS to map the RNA structure of an EBOV minigenome and identified that the trailer non-coding region bound to heat-shock protein A8 promoted minigenome replication [153]; better understanding of host-virus interactions essential for replication could identify new targets for MCMs. Though live EBOV was not used in this study, another group used a similar NGS approach for RG-2/3 viruses, Sindbis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Although it was expected that the genomes of these two alphaviruses fold into different RNA structures, it is noteworthy that these two structures directly led to differing viral infectivity [154]. In addition to these technologies, \u201cthird generation sequencing\u201d technologies (see Section 5.5) have the potential to facilitate sequencing of DNA and RNA base modifications directly [155\u2013157], which can distinguish unmodified from modified bases by measuring changes in electrical currents.",

            "text": "One promising technology that is starting to be used for virology is single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) [163\u2013167]. During scRNA-seq, individual cells are isolated, and unique DNA barcodes are applied to each cell\u2019s RNA followed by NGS to associate each RNA with its cognate cell. Home-brewed methods like Drop-seq [168] and commercial options like 10X Genomics are becoming increasingly popular because scientists can profile thousands of cells in mixed populations, such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or even dissociated tissues. Researchers can also use scRNA-seq to measure heterogeneity in viral replication. For instance, scientists sequenced 3,000\u20134,000 single cells infected at low multiplicity of infection with influenza A virus (FLUAV). Most cells contained <1% FLUAV mRNA, but a number of cells had \u224850% FLUAV reads, indicating extreme heterogeneity of infection, partly attributed to variability of the FLUAV replicative machinery [164]. However, as Drop-seq and 10X Genomics are droplet-based and require specialized equipment, platforms of alternative methods that are microchip- [169] or microwell-based [170], such as Seq-Well [171, 172], are advantageous. These platforms are portable, have minimal equipment requirements, and can be easily decontaminated and discarded. A new technique, Slide-seq, allows spatially resolved single-cell RNA sequencing after transferring RNA from tissue sections onto a new surface covered in DNA-barcoded beads. Using Slide-seq, cell types and their activation states can be directly determined using standard histological work-up [173]. Seq-Well and related technologies could therefore be used in BSL-4 laboratories or in the field, thereby facilitating functional and single-cell studies for RG-4 pathogens.",

The NIH also supports the Virus Pathogen Resource [174], which collates sequence data and experiments from host factor assays. Smaller data portals like virological.org and nextstrain.org [175] also exist and can rapidly disseminate pre-publication data. Advances in algorithms and computing power, described in other chapters of this book, will certainly facilitate searching [176], classifying [177], and processing these massive data sets.

            "text": "Some of the newest NGS technologies, often dubbed third-generation sequencing, have been driven by nanotechnology and possess unique properties that further expand the molecular biology toolkit [114\u2013116]. In contrast to Illumina, Roche 454, and Ion Torrent short-read methodologies that involve cleaving genomic material and sequencing-by-synthesis in cycles (\u2264600 bases per read), Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore methodologies both rely on nanoscale pores to processively read entire DNA strands, producing reads up to hundreds of kilobases long. Though the error rate is often much higher than that of short-read methodologies, long reads are particularly useful for de novo genome assembly, i.e., the assembly of an unknown genome sequence [178, 179] and reconstruction of large haplotypes with multiple mutations or variants [179]. Nanoscale pores also possess other unique benefits. Using Pacific Biosciences technology, a researcher can continuously sequence the same DNA strand in a circle, creating a circular consensus sequence, and thus reducing the error rate [180, 181]. Using Oxford Nanopore technology, a researcher can sequence RNA directly [155\u2013157] and also identify DNA and RNA base modifications [182]. Additionally, the direction of the pores can also be reversed [183\u2013185], and the same DNA strand is read twice for an improved consensus sequence. Perhaps the biggest advantages of Oxford Nanopore devices are their small sizes, typically resembling a USB drive, and the ease of their use [5, 120]. Continued developments in nanotechnology will further reduce instrumentation size and sample requirements and improve the error rate and selectivity of NGS.",

In particular, research in the area of respiratory infections has been greatly propelled using lung-on-a-chip and small airway-on-a-chip technologies [200, 201, 206\u2013210]. For instance, a small airway-on-a-chip was used to model respiratory infection through use of a toll-like receptor 3 agonist, poly-inosinic-poly-cytidylic acid (poly-IC), thereby mimicking cellular events during viral infection of lung epithelial cells [201]. This model replicated complex disease states, such as viral exacerbation of disease in patients suffering from COPD and asthma, and helped identify new potential biomarkers for COPD exacerbation, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor [201]. Meanwhile, additional lung model systems have been used to study fungal and bacterial infections in the lung. For instance, a multi-compartment human bronchiole was created to investigate the production of inflammatory cytokines during colonization with an eurotiomycete (Aspergillus fumigatus) and a gammaproteobacterium (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) [211]. Interestingly, this work showed that colonization of the artificial bronchiole with less virulent A. fumigatus strain results in increased production of inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of leukocytes, a finding that would be less likely made if the experiments were performed on cell monolayers in vitro [211]. Moreover, inflammatory cytokine production differed when the bronchioles were exposed to volatile compounds produced from co-cultures of P. aeruginosa and A. fumigatus compared to monocultures of either microbe [211].",

For instance, primary human hepatocytes were used in combination with organ-on-chip technology to facility the study of hepatitis B virus infection in vitro [212]. The hepatitis B virus life cycle and host immune responses (e.g., cytokine responses) to infection were successfully modeled. In addition, cutting-edge micro-extrusion three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques were adapted to develop a \u201c3D nervous system-on-a-chip\u201d for the study of viral infections of the central nervous system [213]. Using this system, it was found that Schwann cells were refractory to pseudorabies virus infection, but that these cells still nevertheless participated in axon-to-cell spread of the virus. Additionally, infection with a human enterovirus, coxsackievirus B1, was successfully modeled using a human gut-on-chips. The virus infected and replicated within intestinal epithelium and stimulated inflammatory cytokine release in a polarized fashion [214].",

One of the advantages of organoids is the capacity to mimic some of the complexities and functions of natural organs [219]. Given the structural and functional similarities to natural organs, organoids have been used extensively to study infectious disease with human samples [199, 217, 220]. Human respiratory syncytial virus, Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C virus, and Zika virus infection have all been modeled using organoids derived from the lung, gastric, liver, and nervous systems [220]. Recently, human airway organoids were used as a screening platform to study the infectivity of emerging FLUAVs [221]. FLUAV strains known to be highly infectious for humans were associated with higher replication rates in the organoids compared to strains known to poorly infect humans [221].",

In addition, accurately accessing the luminal content of organoids for biochemical analysis is challenging if not impossible. Integrating emerging genetic engineering tools such as CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) or transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALENs) with organoids or organs-on-chips would be of high value. With this integration, researchers can introduce new sensitivity to pathogens (when absent) or to dissect underlying mechanisms of host protection or organ injury during host-pathogen interactions (e.g., through CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion of genes proposed to play roles in protection and susceptibility of infection with pathogens).",

Computationally-aided improvements through design of experiments (DOE) is another approach with the potential to improve the efficiency and yield from studies Although also significantly reducing the burden of research. Improved efficiency is especially relevant given the expense and general difficulty associated with performing research in BSL-4 facilities. Although not a new field, DOE is generally applied to chemistry and pharmaceutical development more than biology, and its core concepts have recently been enhanced by machine learning concepts [223]. For example, fractional factorial DOE could be used for multivariate drug screens to reduce the number of actual conditions required to be measured, without reducing the experimental yield. The same technique could possibly be used to reduce the number of animals required in in vivo studies. Inference-based and machine learning-based methods for drug repurposing are improving (reviewed in [224]). Given the low incidence of most RG-4 pathogen infections, drug repurposing is an important source of potential therapeutics.",

If these futuristic technologies are housed within the BSL-4 laboratory spaces, required machinery will have to be able to withstand repeated, yearly decontamination processes (e.g., paraformaldehyde gassing with subsequent neutralization, Microchem Plus surface decontamination) as the laboratory space is prepared for servicing. Additionally, as use of a BSL-4 facility requires extensive training and registration, outside technicians do not generally have the ability or permission to enter laboratory spaces and service instruments. Instruments, therefore, should not be too complex so that a BSL-4 scientist could troubleshoot them effectively. Alternatively, these instruments can also be housed in a lower biosafety level if test samples can be safely inactivated and removed from the BSL-4 laboratory. Researchers have used this method as part of multiple techniques, including many diagnostic tests that begin with an inactivation step and sample removal from containment before testing [225\u2013227]. As technologies are not generally developed with inactivation methods in mind, a viral inactivation method for safe handling of samples in a lower BSL laboratory that maintains the integrity of sample components will need to be identified. After identification, the effects of these inactivation methods on test integrity (e.g., sample dilutions, signal loss) will require further study.",

Deployment of these technologies to outbreak regions provides the opportunity to further characterize human disease progression and correlates of disease outcome, without the caveats associated with disease models. Use of CyTOF and single-cell sequencing on patient samples collected during disease, for example, could provide valuable data on immune responses that lead to disease survival. Additionally, as autopsies of deceased humans infected with RG-4 pathogens are rare, utilizing CODEX and MIBI could glean valuable information about human disease, even with a single autopsy. However, as outbreaks generally occur in developing countries, challenges to overcome may include lack of infrastructure (including electricity), transportation, and/or staffing. Newly developed technologies will need to be robust enough to counter changes in humidity, temperature, and many other potential stressors occurring in an outbreak setting. Given these complications, the futuristic technologies described in this chapter provide the opportunity to advance the understanding of highly pathogenic and consequential viruses and the diseases they cause.",
