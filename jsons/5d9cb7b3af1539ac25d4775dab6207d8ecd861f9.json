As part of our local experience of stepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology clinics to minimise COVID-19 infection, we installed protective shields on slit lamps (Fig. 1) . We believe the close proximity between ophthalmologists and patients during slit lamp examination could put doctors at risk of infection, as droplets from coughs or sneezes could spread the virus to anyone less than 6 ft away [2] . The measured distance between the doctor's and patient's face on a standard tower slit lamp is just about 1 ft, while that with a portable slit lamp is about 7-8 in. These distances are indeed closer that that seen on routine physical examinations, for example, respiratory examination on a medical ward. These shields can therefore act as an effective barrier in addition to other personal protective equipment.",

Also, they may not be readily available due to limited stock, current high demands and shipment time. We are delighted to share our local experience of custom-made, low-cost shields with all readers. We bought durable plastic sheets of A3 size from stationery shops, i.e. approximately 16 by 12 in. (Height \u00d7 Width). A central cut-out circular area (ranging from 2 to 3 in., size depends on the actual calibre of the slit lamp) is created with scissors (Fig. 2) . A3 is the optimal size to still allow the examiner to place his hand comfortably on the patient's head. The shield can be installed after detaching the biomicroscope from the viewing arm then reattaching it to secure the shield firmly. Installing the film around the eyepieces is also an option for some older slit lamp models.",

            "text": "The material chosen can be a consensus among ophthalmologists locally. Our experience is that the film should ideally be transparent to allow the examiner and the patient to see each other, and firm enough. We found that the spectrum of suitable material ranges from those that are firmer and stiffer, e.g. acrylic, to softer and more flexible, e.g. document folders and binding covers made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polypropylene. Firm plastic is ideal as it minimises the chance of the film springing back and forth, the movement which can be easily caused by the examiner's hand accidentally touching the film during examination. However, one should note that thicker plastic may not be able to fit and it is not possible to cut safely with office tools. Sticking a few pieces of thinner films together by thermal lamination is therefore an option. Chang et al. also suggested using X-ray or MRI photographic film [3] . One may also expose the film to achieve transparency.",
