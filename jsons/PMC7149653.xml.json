In fact, most of our medicines trace originally to chemical compounds from plants\u2014humans did not invent these compounds, nature did. Species in nature have evolved numerous chemicals with diverse purposes and roles\u2014the benefits range from defense to capturing prey. Those same chemicals may also be of value to our own species. Many of these useful compounds are discovered by chance through the basic research of an observant/inquisitive biologist, or traced to a long history of use in traditional medicines. On the one hand, it is therefore important to preserve the Tree of Life simply because there is so much hidden, as-of-yet untapped medical value in the species that compose the Tree of Life. Numerous chemical compounds of direct medical value to our own species await discovery.",

However, as species are lost to extinction, that potential utility is also lost forever\u2014hence, the importance of protecting the species that constitute the Tree of Life, simply for utilitarian reasons. Imagine the loss of a species that held the cure to a disease that might have saved your life, or the lives of your friends, relatives, or children. But imagine that this same species was driven to extinction before that knowledge was realized. How many potential medicines have already been lost due to species loss in the Anthropocene, and how many more will soon follow? If half of all plants (the major source of medicines) go extinct by the end of the century as predicted (see Chapter 6), imagine the human impact on medical loss alone!",

Pitcher plants are carnivorous, widely known for trapping insects and other prey items and digesting them as a source of nitrogen. Prey items fall into a pool of fluid located inside the modified leaf (pitcher) (Fig. 5.2B) that contains digestive enzymes. Basic research has revealed that the pitchers of these plants have also evolved compounds that are antifungal\u2014special enzymes that dissolve the cell walls of fungi. By producing these enzymes, the plants are able to inhibit fungal growth and by so doing the plants do not lose the resources in the prey trapped in the pitcher to fungi (Eilenberg et al., 2006). Significantly, these enzymes have shown great promise as new antifungal drugs in treating infections in our own species. Drugs derived from pitcher plants have been used to treat sciatic pain, symptoms of the herpes simplex virus (Mishra et al., 2013), diabetes (Muhammad et al., 2012), and tumors.\n",

Years of research on the toxic compounds in these venoms resulted in the discovery of ziconotide, a nonaddictive drug, more powerful than morphine, that is used as a treatment for the chronic pain associated with cancer and AIDS.",

There are many such examples, but a classic case involves the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia; Fig. 5.3A\n) from western North America. This relative of pine trees is the original source of the drug paclitaxel (PTX0, sold using the brand name Taxol), a medicine that has been used to treat several types of cancer (Jordan and Wilson, 2004). From 1967 to 1993, nearly all paclitaxel was derived from bark obtained from the Pacific yew. But because the Pacific yew is uncommon and the process of obtaining the bark for medicine is a destructive process that kills the tree, the species is a problematic long-term source of the drug. Consequently, another source of the drug was needed. To find chemicals similar to what the Pacific yew produces, where do we look? Rather than randomly examining all 350,000 species of seed plants, the best approach is to use the Tree of Life to focus on the closest relatives of this species\u2014and that is what was done. A commonly grown related species, the European yew, Taxus baccata, was then instead widely used in medicine until Taxol ultimately was made synthetically.",

But, two distinct species can appear so similar that biologists may have mistakenly considered them a single species. This topic was covered in Chapter 4. But to review, there are frog species that look nearly identical, but differ in their vocalizations, or calls; although difficult for us to distinguish by appearance, the frogs have no problem distinguishing each other. Similarly, there are plant populations that are very much alike in appearance and differ only in chromosome number\u2014they cannot interbreed and have different environmental ranges. Distinct butterfly species may differ only slightly in spot pattern, or species that appear similar may have different behavior patterns. There are many other examples of cryptic species in other lineages, and they abound in nature, as reviewed in Chapter 4. As a result, we have grossly underestimated the number of species on our planet, even in those parts of the Tree of Life where we think we know a great deal (see Chapter 4). By using DNA sequence data and the Tree of Life, it is possible to more rapidly identify cryptic species. DNA sequence data and tree building (often referred to as phylogenetic reconstruction) have been applied to address this question of cryptic species. This approach may reveal that two entities that look similar differ in DNA sequence and have different placements in the Tree of Life. This type of investigation has been applied to several geographic regions thought to harbor large amounts of still undetected biodiversity; using DNA data and comparisons with species already in the Tree of Life can identify such cryptic biological entities quickly (e.g., Lahaye et al., 2008). Such DNA approaches and use of the Tree of Life are becoming more commonly applied by specialists in the continuing search for as yet undiscovered and unnamed species.",

An estimate of PD is not the same as an assessment of either the total number of species or the number of rare species in an area, both commonly used metrics when discussing conversation. While all three measures are incredibly important, they reveal very different things. Imagine two areas in a very simple example (Fig. 5.10\n). Which do you protect? The most species, the rare species, or the largest swathes of the Tree of Life (i.e., protecting PD)?

China is amazing in its extent of plant diversity\u2014the country is home to nearly 10% of the ~350,000 species of flowering plants in the world. Using a large phylogenetic tree for all the genera of China, as well as a second tree for the 26,978 named flowering plant species there, it was possible to assess how the major components of the present-day vegetation came together and what areas are home to the highest PD. In their study, Lu et al. (2018) discovered that the flora of eastern China harbors many of the older lineages in China; distant relatives often co-occur in this part of China, and it has higher PD than does western China. In contrast, western China shows the co-occurrence of closely related plants that appear to be the result of recent mountain uplift, the formation of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and a resulting rapid radiation in that area; as a result, it has lower PD than observed in eastern China (Fig. 5.11\n). These results are important because they\nidentify areas of high PD and provide important data for conservation efforts. For example, the areas of high PD in western China are largely protected, but the same is not the case for areas of high PD in eastern China (Fig. 5.11). This lack of preservation of land in eastern China is often due to urbanization and the division of areas into different administrative units. Because the PD data indicate such high biodiversity in eastern China, an effective and supportive argument can be made for the necessity of more connectivity between national parks and nature reserves in that area (Lu et al., 2018).",

In the case of saxifrages, once a lineage is cold-adapted, it is hard to switch\u2014that is a phylogenetic constraint. These are the additional major features that a phylogeny can reveal.

Farmers and nonfarmers alike remain aware of the traditional process of crop rotation, in which a legume crop (e.g., alfalfa) is grown after a grain crop, such as corn, to enrich the soil with nitrogen. This is made possible because many legumes have special structures on their roots called nodules, which house special bacteria that can convert nitrogen from the air into nitrates that the plant can use. This adaptation enables legumes to thrive in poor soils. In many regions, crop rotation has largely been replaced by the application of large amounts of nitrogen-containing fertilizers.",
