            "text": "Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan has spread throughout China from December 2019, which has seriously threatened human health (Huang et al., 2020). On 30th January, WHO announced the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP, later renamed as COVID-19) epidemic as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (WHO, 2020). According to the statistics of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 81,054 confirmed cases, 687,680 suspected cases and 3261 deaths had been reported in Chinese mainland up to 24:00 on March 21 (NHCPRC, 2020). The outbreak of COVID-19 as a major health care event has exerted a negative impact on daily life, threatened people\u2019s health both mentally and physically, and endangered social and economic development (Ma et al., 2020). In the face of such a severe situation, the government and the health department have issued various prevention and control policies, and actively taken various prevention and control measures to contain the epidemic. Since COVID-19 is the largest public health emergency in China in the past ten years, many young health care workers take active part in battling the COVID-19 epidemic. Different from the experienced ones who have ever joined the Public Health Emergency such as SARS, H1N1, the fresh health care workers at around 30 years old are confronted with the much more occupational stress, which is also a big challenge to their resilience and mental health.",

The current study further revealed that people without public health emergency experience showed worse mental health, resilience and social support, and tended to get psychological abnormality on interpersonal sensitivity and photic anxiety. Apart from working at the front line, they stayed at room alone without any face-to-face interpersonal communication. Lack of social support leads to much more depression and anxiety especially in high-risk working conditions (Plaisier et al., 2007). In order to prevent cross infection, the social distance between people had to be increased. When others had fevers or cough, people became more sensitive and tended to show some obsessive-compulsive symptoms such as washing hands repeatedly. The daily increasing numbers of confirmed cases and deaths also increase the level of anxiety and terror in the fresh staff. Nevertheless, majority of the experienced staff had taken part in previous public health emergence before, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H1N1. They knew how to protect themselves better and had the confidence to overcome the disease compared with fresh staff, which was of benefit to enhance their resilience and mental health. Therefore, constructive peer-support (Banerjee, 2020), effective online mental health service (Yao et al., 2020) and early screening and interventions (Zandifar and Badrfam, 2020) were necessary to address mental health needs in health care workers.",

Resilience is regarded as a protective factor to mental health (Hu et al., 2015a, b). The fresh staff with high strength and tenacity showed greater courage and would not quit in this medical battle. Certainly, good social support might also have buffered the average severity of symptom among people in high risk work (Chen et al., 2005; Dyregrov et al., 1996). Therefore, it is important to have a high level of training and professional experience in health care workers engaging in public health emergence, especially for the fresh staff.",
