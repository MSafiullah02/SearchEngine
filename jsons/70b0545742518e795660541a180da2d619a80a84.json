Addition of p33C to the standard p88C RdRp assay with dsDI-72 template revealed slight inhibitory effect on p88C RdRp activity (Fig. S1B) , instead of the expected stimulatory effect. P33C also strongly inhibited p88C RdRp activity on dsDI-72(5'\u039469) template (Fig. S1C ). Based on these observations, we suggest that p33C does not have an RNA chaperone activity comparable with the full-length p33.",

Therefore, we tested if the N-terminal segment of p33 could bind to the viral RNA in a gel mobility shift experiment. Indeed, construct p33-N1-82 carrying the N-terminal 82 aa bound to the labeled RNA template in vitro, whereas the shorter version (termed p33-N1-72 with 72aa segment) bound less efficiently (Fig. S1D ). These dada suggested that the N-terminal portion of p33 contains ssRNA binding activity. Further experiments have demonstrated that ssRNA-binding by p33-N1-82 is non-specific and much weaker than ssRNA binding by p33C (not shown).",
