Since then, no transmission of any enveloped viruses has taken place by SD treated products, including coagulation factor concentrates. Pasteurization, dry\u2010heat treatment and nanofiltration (although the last one introduced approximately 10 years ago), have similar robust safety records for enveloped viruses. The combination of more than one effective step, based on different virus elimination mechanisms (e.g. inactivation or removal) increased the safety margin of plasma products to unprecedented levels, quite comparable to those of any existing biological product. Table 1 shows a summary of experiments performed on Grifols\u2019 FVIII/VWF and FIX products, for SD treatments and nanofiltration (data on file, Instituto Grifols, S.A.).",

This plasma is submitted to an inventory hold of 60 days or over, and at least the donor has to donate twice before the plasma can be accepted for manufacture (qualified donor). During the inventory hold period, if the donor seroconverts or is subject to any other cause of rejection, all previous available units in inventory will be discarded. While the hold period is taking place, all collected plasma is subjected to Nucleic acid testing (NAT) in pilot sample minipools for HIV, HBC, HCV, Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and B19 virus (B19V). Given the extreme sensitivity of NAT testing, this measure is very effective in practically closing the \u2018window period\u2019, i.e. when a unit can be negative for serological markers but already viraemic. The introduction of NAT testing of plasma for fractionation multiplies the safety margin for both enveloped and non\u2010enveloped agents. Finally, the actual starting plasma pool for fractionation is retested for the above mentioned serological markers and for HIV, HCV and HBV nucleic acids by NAT.",

In case of biotechnological products, bovine derived materials which were commonly used in the past are avoided or sourced from \u2018BSE\u2010free\u2019 countries. In case of plasma derivatives, in spite of the absence of transmissions, several additional precautionary measures have been introduced, which are included in the donors\u2019 questionnaire and deal with CJD antecedents or travelling to UK or Europe for specific duration periods. But, undoubtedly, the most effective precautionary measure is avoiding the fractionation of UK plasma. Although probably unnecessary because of the capacity of plasma fractionation to remove TSE agents, this measure eliminates in practice the major source of risk, given the differences of magnitude of the BSE and associated vCJD epidemics in UK vs. the rest of the world. Currently, the UK plasma manufacturer employs plasma from plasmapheresis obtained in the USA. The second country in terms of number of vCJD cases, France, still fractionates locally collected plasma, because of the results of a product specific TSE risk assessment [16].",
