            "text": "A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread throughout many countries including the United States since its discovery in December 2019.1 Many locations in the US are looking to rapidly expand their testing capabilities for this virus as they believe this could provide an important means to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.2\u20136 However, the benefit of widespread testing depends on the accuracy of the test, and how the results of the test will affect treatment. For mild cases of COVID-19 (which are the primary target of the outpatient testing facilities), no specific medications are indicated, so in most cases, the results of the test would not change treatment. With regard to the accuracy of the test, the most commonly used test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 is a nasopharyngeal swab that uses a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to identify viral RNA. Data from in vitro analyses suggest that the RT-PCR test is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2, as it is not positive when exposed to the nucleic acid of other common viruses.7 Similarly, the in vitro sensitivity of RT-PCR tests is high, but in clinical settings the sensitivity of the nasopharyngeal RT-PCR swab tests for diagnosing COVID-19 is questionable. This article will review the clinical data regarding the accuracy of the COVID-19 RT-PCR test.",

However, the available in vitro data along with minimal clinical data suggest that the test has very high specificity. On the other hand, the sensitivity is moderate (perhaps between 63\u201378%). Among the various ways of performing RT-PCR, pharyngeal swabs seem to have lowest sensitivity; nasal swabs may be a bit more sensitive than pharyngeal swabs. RT-PCR analysis of BAL fluid seems to be the most accurate means of virologic confirmation, but BAL fluid can only reasonably be collected on the sickest cohort of patients. For patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms, identifying characteristic findings on CT imaging of the chest may be more sensitive than RT-PCR testing.",

However, in cities where COVID-19 is already widespread, the testing of large numbers of individuals with mild illness will have minimal effect on treatment but will require massive resources. There is epidemiological benefit to testing, but in cities already being devastated by COVID-19, the numbers of hospitalizations and mortalities associated with it can be used as indicators of disease impact. Reduced testing of patients with mild disease could save testing materials so that sicker patients and healthcare professionals will have access to testing. Additionally, a large amount of personal protective equipment could be saved by not attempting to test the many thousands and perhaps what will be millions of mild COVID-19 cases.",
