Given that a fraction of the agents have the choice of staying in any two given states, we show that the total infected population in the country could be as low as that achieved with a complete stoppage of inter-state movements for a prolonged period, provided that the agents follow a stochastic strategy, used in the Minority Game, for their movement decisions. Due to the random (but fixed in time) choices of the agents, the system essentially forms a set of D/2 coupled Minority Games, played simultaneously. We further show that it is the agents moving once between any two states following the stochastic strategy who are less likely to be infected than those not having (or not opting for) such a movement choice, when the risk of getting infected during the travel is not considered.",

At times when such restrictions are fully or partially lifted, an inevitable question for a significant fraction of the population would be to change their locations in order to escape the regions of higher infections. But given an influx of population, some of whom could be a carrier of the disease, to a relatively less infected region can increase the infection rate in those regions. Therefore, a region which was initially had low infections, could become a less viable option in the subsequent times, due to movements of population there from other higher infected regions. Furthermore, if a country has D states with different rates of infection, one person may have a rather limited option in terms of the number of states in which they can live for a long time. Also, in a given state, different persons will have their options distributed between the rest D \u2212 1 states. We can consider the relatively safer places from the perspective of one agent as a limited resource that is being sought by a large number of agents. Due to the inherent coupling arising out of the possible parallel choices of one state by agents from multiple other states, the problem finding the said resource of safe locations can now become a cooperative, multi-agent, complex optimization process with emergent statistical properties.",

There have been many attempts to address these problems from a game theoretic perspective (see e.g., congestion games [2] ). When the number of choices for an agent is limited to two, the resource allocation problem generally falls within the category of the Minority Game (MG) [3] [4] [5] [6] , where an odd number (N = 2M + 1) of agents try to be, through repeated and parallely decided autonomous choices, in the minority group, thereby winning a higher share of the (conserved) resources, or in the language of game theory, a positive pay-off. Clearly, the Nash equilibrium state for the problem is when the populations P 1 and P 2 in the two choices are M and M + 1, such that one agent cannot benefit by their own action alone provided that the others stick to their respective choices. The objective is to reach this state of minimal fluctuation \u2206 = |P 1 \u2212 P 2 | between the two choices in the least possible amount of time.",

            "text": "In the usual Minority Games, the variations in the target variable i.e., the populations in the two choices, take place due to the movements or switching of choices between the two options. In this work, we study the situation where D number of total choices exists, but one agent tries to be in the minority group in terms of the infection number, by moving between only two choices. The two choices for the N agents are random. Therefore, the infected population in a given region can change due to (a) movements of agents from the other D \u2212 1 regions and (b) due to the evolution of the epidemic within the region. The evolution of epidemic in our case follow the dynamics of a Susceptible (S)-Infected (I)-Recovered (R) model. Given that the target variable for minimizing fluctuation (infected population) is not a conserved quantity, an equilibrium state is not defined. However, a well defined quantity is the total infected population in the country after the end of the epidemic. We show here that a stochastic strategy for switching choices, with a restriction on the total number of allowed switches, can reduce the total infected number compared to a temporary ban on inter-state movements. Furthermore, it is the agents opting for switching of their choice who are less likely to be infected. This shows an individual incentive exists for a strategy which is good for the whole population.",

As there are D choices, the problem reduces to D/2 decoupled Minority Games, if the agents in a pair of choices are completely non-overlapping with the agents of any other pair of choices. The strategy that has proved to be the most efficient [7] in reducing fluctuations in such cases is that agents in the majority choice at an instant t will switch with a probability p + (t) = (\u2206(t)\u22121)/2 M+\u2206(t)+1 and the agents in the minority will not switch (p \u2212 (t) = 0). However, the choices here could be overlapping i.e., the agents in one choice at a given instant may have their other choice distributed between D \u2212 1 options (see Fig. 1 (a)). We keep the switching probability for a given (\u03b1-th) agent in the majority at a given instant to be p + (t) =",

We ensure the initial condition such that a given region is a possible choice for 2M + 1 agents. Therefore, a global minimization of fluctuation is achieved when D/2 locations have population M and the other D/2 locations have population M + 1. Nevertheless, due to the random assignment of choices between the agents, a given agent can end up with two choices, both having populations M +1. We call that a 'majority locked' agent. In Fig. 1 (b) we show the variation of the fraction of this majority locked agents with time as D is increased. The fraction does not always go to zero, and the time taken to reach a minimum value increases exponentially with D. We then impose a constraint that one agent can switch only once (see Fig.  1 (c)). Then the fraction of the majority locked agents still does not go to zero, but a reduction, although comparatively low, can be achieved in a time scale with no significant variation with D in the rage of the simulations. Therefore, we see that the this movement strategy still works considerably better than a random choice, where fluctuation grows with population involved with \u221a N or variations of that which does not change such scaling but only reduces the fluctuation by a constant factor at best. We then proceed with this stochastic strategy of movement to apply in the case where an epidemic dynamics is present in the D states (see e.g., [11] [12] [13] [14] for very recent works on the COVID-19 spreading and its effects). We consider the sites of a square lattice (L \u00d7 L) to represent possible locations for agents in one state. The simplest possible case where a parallel Minority Game could be defined is when D = 4, which we take here. We take L = 160 and each state is initially occupied with 10000 agents i.e., an occupation fraction of about 0.39. This is less than the site percolation threshold [9] , which represents a reasonable restriction in interactions among the populations in terms of either the imposed social distancing or due to other factors seen in epidemic spreading [10] (see Supplemental Materials Fig. for variations of infec-tion with occupation fraction). The agents are in one of three states: Susceptible (S), Infected (I) or Recovered (R). At any instant, one infected agent can infect its neighboring 8 agents (nearest neighbors and diagonal neighbors) with probability \u03b2, provided the neighbors are in S-state. An infected agent remains infected for a period \u03c4 = 14 days and then recovers. Given that the reproduction rate R 0 for the COVID-19 pandemic is about 2.28 [15] , we keep the infection probability \u03b3 = 2.28/(\u03c4 z) \u2248 0.02, as \u03c4 = 14 and z = 8. While this gives a correct order for the infection probability, this is by no means a precise estimate, which will vary due to the clustering of the locations, immunity variations of the agents and so on. Inevitably, a spike in the movement is noted immediately following the lifting of lock down. This almost in all cases results in a second peak for the total infected fraction. When the effect of lock down is minimal (very late imposition), the restricted movements following the strategy mentioned in Eq.",

Invariably, a spike in the movement is noticed immediately following the lifting of a lock down, which then subsequently decreases. This is intuitively clear, as a lock down will keep the initially infected region highly infectious and immediately after the lifting of the lock down, agents will move out of it (see SM Fig.  4 for details) . Almost in all cases, the lifting of the lock down induces a second peak in the total infected fraction. Clearly, this is due to deconfinement and spreading of infections among the different regions. Indeed, the total infected fraction becomes rather limited, when the imposed lock down is very late, which basically amounts to only following the restricted movement rules mentioned above.",

Also, if the ratio of the infection probability is calculated for the agents opting for a switch in their choices following Eq.

A measure of such a risk is the difference between the number of infected agents in region 1 and the average number of infected agents in the remaining regions. In Fig. 4 we plot the relative risk, with the changes in the population in region 1 from its starting value 10000 for various duration of lock downs and their starting times. There is a symmetric oscillatory pattern in the population change in region 1, when the total infected fraction is high. For lower total infection, the symmetric property vanishes. We show in Fig. how does the curve vary for the case without a lock down. We also show that the total infected fraction is a monotonically increasing (almost linear) single valued function of the number of infected agents moving during the entire epidemic dynamics (see Fig. 5 ). This is true irrespective of the lock down duration and the starting point, or even without a lock down. This implies that the epidemic dynamics and the movement strategies are largely independent. It is only the total infected people moving that affects the total infected fraction.",

A filled shape represents a site occupied by an agent and a similar empty shape, connected by black line, represents their alternative choice. Here all agents have an alternative choice. If only similar agents and their alternative choices exist between a pair of regions, say the yellow or green regions, then the problem reduces to a pair of decoupled Minority Game. However, the games are coupled when an agent has two choices between two types of regions, marked by red lines. (b) The fraction of majority locked agents (see text) are shown with time for different numbers of regions. The fraction decreases with time, but with a time scale that grows exponentially with D. The number of movements by any given agent is completely unrestricted. (b) The fraction of majority-locked agents are shown when a restriction of only one switch of choice is imposed on the agents. The decrease in the fraction is low, but almost independent of D.",
