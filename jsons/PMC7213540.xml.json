Managing the \u201cinfodemic\u201d3 includes filtering out the expansive false information about the COVID-19 outbreak, and in some respects is just as important as fighting the pandemic itself.4 Nevertheless, social media can also have a positive effect by bringing people socially closer to each other while still maintaining physical distancing. It is a strategy that may be able to overcome the psychologic effects of the crisis in the long run. This approach needs public education and revising the culture of using social media. In addition to all the advice given to preventing the negative psychologic consequences of the disease, it should be emphasized that distancing oneself from others does not mean being emotionally or socially distant. Maintaining connections with others is essential for our mental and physical health, and for this purpose, social media is a unique tool.5 This kind of connection needs social closeness that cannot be provided by social distancing.",

There are many studies that confirm the impact of social distancing on mental health, particularly if it results in social isolation.3 Although the definition of social distancing in current distancing guidelines refers to the physical aspect,1 it is feared that in the long term, forgetting this concept will lead to human error and social isolation. Therefore, it seems that instead of using the term \u201csocial distancing\u201d, it is better for us to use \u201cphysical distancing\u201d to make it clear that it is necessary to maintain and promote social closeness now more than ever to protect the mental health of our community.",
