More surprising was the recent discovery that eukaryotic genomes contain sequences from RNA viruses that have no DNA stage in their life cycle. Similarly, several single-stranded DNA viruses have left integrated copies in their host genomes. This review explores some major evolutionary aspects arising from the discovery of these endogenous viral elements (EVEs). In particular, the reasons for the bias toward EVEs derived from negative-sense RNA viruses are considered, as well as what they tell us about the long-term ''arms races'' between hosts and viruses, characterized by episodes of selection and counter-selection. Most dramatically, the presence of orthologous EVEs in divergent hosts demonstrates that some viral families have ancestries dating back almost 100 million years, and hence are far older than expected from the phylogenetic analysis of their exogenous relatives.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Although it has long been known that the eukaryote genome contains a myriad of complete and partial relatives of retroviruses called endogenous retroviruses that are now inherited passively with the host genetic component, it was surprising to discover that sequences of RNA viruses, which do not make a DNA intermediate and usually do not enter the host cell nucleus, were also present in eukaryotic genomes (Crochu et al., 2004) . Although integrated copies of single-strand DNA (ssDNA) viruses were found in the genomes of plant viruses some years ago (Bejarano et al., 1996) , a number of endogenized ssDNA viruses were recently described in a diverse set of animal genomes (Belyi et al., 2010a; Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010) . Such an array of virally derived genetic material raises a number of important evolutionary questions, which forms the basis of this review. Perhaps the most important theme is that more than expanding our basic knowledge of the composition of eukaryotic genomes, the presence of endogenous viruses has had a profound impact on our understanding of the time-scale of virus evolution, the consequences of which are yet to be fully understood.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 409, "end": 430, "text": "(Crochu et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 555, "end": 578, "text": "(Bejarano et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 678, "end": 699, "text": "(Belyi et al., 2010a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 700, "end": 730, "text": "Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Although endogenous viruses have been classified in different ways, a useful collective term for them all that reflects their generally fragmentary nature is ''endogenous viral elements'' (EVEs) (Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010) . From here on, the term EVE will be used to refer to all endogenous viruses, whether derived from retroviruses, DNA viruses, or RNA viruses, although this review will generally focus on the latter group. EVEs are generated when a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) copy of the viral genome is integrated into the host germline ( Figure 1 ). Although the production of dsDNA intermediates that integrate into host genomic DNA is an obligatory part of the retroviral life cycle, germline as opposed to somatic cell integration is expected to be a rare event. Despite this, endogenous retroviruses are surprisingly common; for example, approximately 5%-8% of the human genome is composed of endogenous retroviruses (Katzourakis and Tristem, 2005) . These comprise at least 31 distinct families, such that there have been at least 31 separate integration events, and likely many more. In some animal species, it has even proven possible to see retroviral endogenization in action (Tarlinton et al., 2006) . Not surprisingly, those EVEs derived from nonretroviruses are far rarer and hence represent the consequence of sporadic evolutionary events.

This example involved the insect flavivirus cell fusing agent (CFA), fragments of which were found to be integrated into the genomes of Aedes spp. mosquitoes (Crochu et al., 2004) , and which has also been observed in some other insect flaviviruses (Roiz et al., 2009) .

Although novel exogenous filoviruses have recently been discovered (Barrette et al., 2011) , they generally infect a small number of mammalian species-particularly primate and bat species from equatorial Africa-with occasional high-profile spillovers into human populations. Indeed, there has been a long running debate as to the natural reservoir of filoviruses, with various species of fruit bat being perhaps the most likely candidate (Leroy et al., 2005) . In contrast, endogenous filoviruses have been detected in the genomes of diverse mammalian taxa, including both placental and marsupial mammals (Belyi et al., 2010b; Taylor et al., 2010) . While much of the evolution of these endogenous filoviruses can be measured on time scales of millions of years-especially as EVEs from rat and mouse are inserted at homologous loci, strongly suggesting that they have codiverged with these species-it is evident that a number of independent insertion events have occurred (Taylor et al., 2010) . Most notably, those filovirus EVEs infecting placental and marsupial mammals are not sister taxa, as expected given ancient virus-host codivergence, with the EVEs from marsupials more closely related to the exogenous filoviruses. This is a remarkable observation, given the geographic separation of these two groups; most known exogenous filoviruses are of African origin, whereas the marsupial endogenous filoviruses are largely from Australian species, with a single representative found in an American opossum that constitutes the closest relative of the exogenous filoviruses (Taylor et al., 2010) . Such a disjunct distribution is highly suggestive of the presence of further, currently uncharacterized, exogenous filoviruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 199, "text": "(Barrette et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 547, "end": 567, "text": "(Leroy et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 714, "end": 735, "text": "(Belyi et al., 2010b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 736, "end": 756, "text": "Taylor et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1081, "end": 1102, "text": "(Taylor et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1706, "text": "(Taylor et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 105, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "The Types and Phylogenetic Distribution of Endogenous Viruses"}, {"text": "Despite the evident under-and biased sampling of EVEs, there is a striking imbalance in the taxonomic origins of those EVEs derived from RNA viruses described to date; at the time of writing, only eight families of RNA viruses have been shown to possess endogenous relatives, five of which represent viruses with negative-sense genomes (ssRNA \u00c0 viruses), and three of these falling into the Mononegavirales-a higher-order grouping of multiple families of ssRNA \u00c0 viruses with unsegmented genomes (Table 1 ). In addition, those EVEs derived from positive-sense RNA viruses (ssRNA + viruses) are at extremely low copy number; one genomic copy in the case of the Reoviridae, five in the case of the Flaviviridae, and probably a small number in PVY. Such a bias toward ssRNA \u00c0 viruses merits explanation. In the case of the bornavirus EVEs, at least part of the explanation must relate to their nuclear replication cycle, increasing the chances of endogenization (see below). Similarly, there will be an elevated chance of endogenization for those viruses that The presence of EVEs in related species A and B and integrated into the same genomic position such that they are orthologous indicates that this integration event occurred prior to the divergence of these two species (species C is an outgroup). If it is known when species A and B diverged, then the minimum age of the insertion event can also be estimated. See Katzourakis and Gifford (2010) for more details. Figure kindly provided by Rob Gifford. cause persistent as opposed to acute host infections. However, as ssRNA + viruses are as likely to generate persistent infections as ssRNA \u00c0 viruses, this cannot explain the extreme distribution bias. It is also possible that some EVEs are better able to achieve germline integration than others (Horie et al., 2010; Johnson 2010) , although the determinants of this process are currently unclear, nor is why it might occur more frequently with ssRNA \u00c0 viruses. One possibility is that the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of ssRNA \u00c0 viruses are more favorable templates for L1-mediated reverse transcription than those of other viruses (Horie et al., 2010) , although why is again unclear. One clue to the preponderance of ssRNA \u00c0 viruses comes from the strong bias toward the integration of nucleoprotein (NP) genes (Figures 2 and 3) . The Mononegavirales share a common genome organization, in which the NP gene has the most 3 0 location and the L gene, which encodes the RdRp, the most 5 0 . In all Mononegavirales except the filoviruses genes are transcribed in a sequential manner from 3 0 to 5 0 and with stepwise attenuation. This results in discrete mRNAs for each gene and means that the most 3 0 gene (NP) is the most abundant RNA, and the most 5 0 (L) gene the least abundant, and hence that whole genomes of Mononegavirales are not expected to be endogenized. That most EVEs represent NP genes also suggests that endogenization is at least in part a function of relative mRNA abundance. Indeed, many ssRNA + viruses produce a single large polyprotein, and it may be that L1-mediated reverse transcription occurs more efficiently on the shorter mRNAs produced by ssRNA \u00c0 viruses. Similarly, it is possible that the life cycle of ssRNA + viruses, in which translation occurs before transcription, also influences mRNA abundance and hence the probability of endogenization.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1419, "end": 1449, "text": "Katzourakis and Gifford (2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1506, "text": "Gifford.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1803, "end": 1823, "text": "(Horie et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1837, "text": "Johnson 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2134, "end": 2154, "text": "(Horie et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 496, "end": 504, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2332, "text": "(Figures 2 and 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "The Types and Phylogenetic Distribution of Endogenous Viruses"}, {"text": "As noted above, one reason why the existence of endogenous RNA viruses came as a surprise to researchers is that they require two unusual steps in the viral life cycle: first, the viral genetic material needs to enter the cell nucleus, when the fact that RNA viruses carry their own RdRp means that they usually (with a few exceptions) only inhabit the cytoplasm, and second, ssRNA needs to be converted into dsDNA (Figure 1 ). There are currently little meaningful data to determine how the first process occurs, although it is striking that endogenous bornaviruses are particularly commonplace and these are one of the few families of RNA viruses that replicate within the cell nucleus (Horie et al., 2010 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 688, "end": 707, "text": "(Horie et al., 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 415, "end": 424, "text": "(Figure 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Generation and Fitness of Endogenous Viruses"}, {"text": "Orang-utan There are, however, a number of plausible ways in which the conversion from ssRNA to dsDNA can occur. Perhaps the most likely involves a reverse transcription step using the reverse transcriptase (RT) present in the cellular retroelements that are abundant in eukaryotic genomes. For example, long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINES) are a common component of vertebrate genomes, particularly members of the L1 family, and therefore are a potentially rich source of RT. In fact, the flanking sequences of some EBLNs possess signatures suggestive of L1-mediated reverse transcription, such as the presence of 3 0 poly-A tails and target site duplications (Belyi et al., 2010b; Horie et al., 2010) , while the endogenous PVY elements in plants possess direct repeats and lie within a sequence itself flanked by inverted repeats (Tanne and Sela, 2005) , compatible with transposable element-mediated integration. More directly, nonhomologous recombination between an exogenous RNA virus and an intracisternal A-type particle (IAP) retrotransposon has been observed to result in the reverse transcription and cellular integration of viral RNAs (Geuking et al., 2009 ). Alternatively, it is possible that the RT is provided by an exogenous retrovirus that is infecting the host at the same time, and particularly where this exogenous infection is associated with a high viral copy number and abundant RT. The situation is rather different for the endogenized DNA viruses. As small ssDNA (2010), Taylor et al.

A similar story can be told for the endogenous hepadnaviruses, the first of which was discovered in the zebra finch and designated eZHBV (Gilbert and Feschotte, 2010) (Figure 4) . Importantly, hepadnaviruses possess dsDNA genomes, utilize RT, replicate in the nucleus, and integrated copies are seen with the human form of the virus where they are associated with liver cancer (Bonilla Guerrero and Roberts, 2005) . Although the precise mechanisms of genomic integration are unknown (Gilbert and Feschotte, 2010) , hepadnaviruses clearly possess a number of the necessary attributes for endogenization. In this context, it is interesting that endogenous copies of another important agent of human cancer-the papillomaviruses-have yet to be discovered, even though they possess dsDNA genomes, enter the cell nucleus, and are commonplace in vertebrates (Bernard et al., 1994) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 670, "end": 691, "text": "(Belyi et al., 2010b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 692, "end": 711, "text": "Horie et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 842, "end": 864, "text": "(Tanne and Sela, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1156, "end": 1177, "text": "(Geuking et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1506, "end": 1526, "text": "Taylor et al.

This is most likely a reflection of the extreme size constraints faced by RNA and small DNA viruses, which rarely have genomes >20,000 nt and are characterized by a lack of truly nonfunctional genomic regions. Importantly, not only do RNA and ssDNA viruses both have very small genome sizes, but they also have a relatively high mutation rate per nucleotide (Sanju\u00e1 n et al., 2010) , such that mutational load likely limits genome size (Holmes, 2011) . Accordingly, an increase in viral genome size that would follow the insertion of a host gene would result in a concomitant increase in mutational load and hence a reduction in viral fitness (Holmes, 2009 ). One of the few cases of RNA virus capture and maintenance of a host gene concerns the ExoN domain of coronaviruses and roniviruses, which encodes a 3 0 -to-5 0 exoribonuclease. This domain shares a distant similarity with host cellular proteins of the DEDD superfamily of exonucleases that are involved in proofreading (Minskaia et al., 2006; Snijder et al., 2003) , and a proofreading mechanism has recently been demonstrated in coronaviruses (Denison et al., 2011) . Hence, coronaviruses and roniviruses may be able to reduce, to some extent, the high error rate normally associated with RdRp replication, in turn allowing an increase in genome size up to $30,000 nt and making them the largest of all RNA viruses.

A good example is provided by the endogenous and exogenous versions of Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus . Protection here stems from the similar Gag proteins exhibited by the endogenous and exogenous forms of these viruses. The Gag protein from the endogenous virus interacts and coassembles with the exogenous Gag proteins, making chimeric and defective viral particles (Murcia et al., 2007) . Notably, some exogenous viruses have escaped from this restriction, indicative of a virus-host evolutionary ''arms race'' , and these are discussed in more detail below. However, immunity is not the only possible functional benefit for the host. Some wasp species encode genomic relatives of nudiviruses that produce virus-like particles that allow them to parasitize the larvae of lepidopterans by manipulating host responses (B\u00e9 zier et al., 2009) , EVEs integrated near genes may be co-opted as promoters or cis-regulatory elements (Feschotte, 2008) , and the protein syncytin that is involved in the development of the human placenta is derived from the envelope protein of an endogenous retrovirus (HERV-W) (Mi et al., 2000) . Another line of evidence suggestive of EVE function is that their sequences are sometimes more conserved than might be expected from an entirely neutral evolutionary process. A case in point are some endogenous bornaviruses that have acquired fewer stop codon mutations than expected given their antiquity, such that they are subject to the process of purifying selection indicative of functional constraint (Belyi et al., 2010b; Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010) . However, the precise function of these bornavirus EVEs is unknown, and that endogenous RNA viruses are so rarely found in host genomes, are fragmentary, and often contain debilitating mutations suggests that they are usually chance passengers in our genome.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 944, "end": 972, "text": "Gilbert and Feschotte (2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1071, "text": "Gilbert.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1706, "text": "(Murcia et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 2136, "end": 2158, "text": "(B\u00e9 zier et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2261, "text": "(Feschotte, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2421, "end": 2438, "text": "(Mi et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2849, "end": 2870, "text": "(Belyi et al., 2010b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2871, "end": 2901, "text": "Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Figure 4. Evolution of Exogenous and Endogenous Avian Hepadnaviruses"}, {"text": "Although many of the possible evolutionary consequences of EVEs merit more-detailed investigation, their discovery has already contributed to a radical shift in our understanding of the time scale of virus evolution. As pointed about by a number of authors, the power of EVEs in this context is that they effectively represent a ''fossil record'' of past viral infections, albeit a very biased one (Emerman and Malik, 2010) . The key point here is that once integrated into host genomes, EVEs cease to evolve with the very high substitution rates that characterize exogenous RNA and small DNA viruses (Holmes, 2009 ) and instead replicate using high-fidelity host DNA polymerases and probably experience fewer replications per unit time. This will result in a dramatic reduction in evolutionary rate, from the virus scale (usually around 10 \u00c03 nucleotide substitutions per site, per year) (Duffy et al., 2008) to the host scale ($10 \u00c09 subs/site/year). If the mutational differences between endogenous viruses are known to occur after integration, such as those between duplicated EVEs, those observed between the LTRs of retroviral EVEs, or, most powerfully of all, when there is clear evidence for virus-host codivergence-such as when EVEs are integrated into similar genomic positions in sister taxa, which definitively shows that they are orthologous-then an evolutionary time scale can be estimated in a relatively straightforward manner using host divergence times as calibration points (Figures 1  and 4) . However, as with all fossils, there is uncertainty about the exact timing of the evolutionary strata, particularly in cases where it is impossible to exclude the independent integration into different species. Indeed, as cross-species transmission between related hosts appears to be a major mode of exogenous RNA virus evolution (Kitchen et al., 2011) , independent insertion may sometimes be difficult to exclude unless the EVEs in question occupy orthologous loci.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 398, "end": 423, "text": "(Emerman and Malik, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 601, "end": 614, "text": "(Holmes, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 889, "end": 909, "text": "(Duffy et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1866, "text": "(Kitchen et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1493, "end": 1511, "text": "(Figures 1  and 4)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "EVEs and the Time Scale of Viral Evolution"}, {"text": "Those studies of the time scale of EVE evolution undertaken to date have revealed that some virus families are of great antiquity. Indeed, the analysis of EVEs has generally painted a radically different picture of the time scale of viral evolution than that inferred from molecular clock studies using ''heterochronous'' samples from a single virus; that is, molecular clock studies of the differences in tree branch lengths between exogenous viruses sampled at different time points during epidemiological history (Drummond et al., 2003) . The best described case is that of the primate lentiviruses, a group of pathogens that includes the human (HIV) and simian (SIV) immunodeficiency viruses. Estimates of the age of primate lentiviruses based on the use of heterochronous sequences result in time scales of thousands (Sharp et al., 2001) or even hundreds (Wertheim and Worobey, 2009 ) of years, which are surprisingly recent given the great genetic and geographic diversity of these viruses in nonhuman primates from Africa (Hahn et al., 2000) . In contrast, the presence of endogenous lentiviruses in lemurs indicates that these viruses have circulated in some primates for at least several million years (Gifford et al., 2008) , while biogeographic analyses of SIV are suggestive of time scales of hundreds of thousands of years and perhaps far longer (Worobey et al., 2010) . In addition, the presence of RELIK (rabbit endogenous lentivirus type K) (Katzourakis et al., 2007) elements in related lagomorph species (rabbits and hares) suggests that lentiviruses have been present in other mammalian orders for at least 12 million years (Keckesova et al., 2009; van der Loo et al., 2009) . Similar stories can be told for other viruses. The observation of endogenous hepadnaviruses integrated at the same genomic positions in bird species provides compelling evidence that hepadnaviruses have been in circulating in birds for at least 19 million years and perhaps as long as 40 million years (Figure 4 ) (Gilbert and Feschotte, 2010) . Such ancient evolution sits in stark contrast to molecular clock studies of hepadnavirus evolution based on the use of contemporary avian viruses, in which evolutionary history has been measured in time scales of thousands of years (Zhou and Holmes, 2007) . Similarly, the earliest integrations of bornaviruses are proposed to have occurred almost 100 million years ago (MYA) (Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010) and those of circoviruses at over 50 MYA (Belyi et al., 2010a; Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010) (Table 1) . Not only do these data describe a far older history for some viral families than previously anticipated, but such ancient virus-host codivergence sits in marked contrast to the process of recent cross-species transmission and emergence (i.e., host jumping) that characterizes many exogenous viruses. A good example is provided by the parvoviruses. While some endogenous parvoviruses have been associated with their hosts for perhaps 30 million years (Kapoor et al., 2010; Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010), these small DNA viruses represent a textbook example of recent viral emergence. In particular, it is well known that feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) jumped to dogs in the late 1970s and resulted in the pandemic spread of canine parvovirus (CPV) (Parrish 1990 ) and has evolved rapidly since this time (Shackelton et al., 2005) . Finally, early divergences also have been proposed for the families of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs); the origin of the HERV-A family has been proposed at between 57 and 92 MYA, that of HERV-K to between 51 and 83 MYA, and HERV-L at between 62 and 100 MYA (Katzourakis and Tristem, 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 516, "end": 539, "text": "(Drummond et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 822, "end": 842, "text": "(Sharp et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 860, "end": 887, "text": "(Wertheim and Worobey, 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1029, "end": 1048, "text": "(Hahn et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1211, "end": 1233, "text": "(Gifford et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1359, "end": 1381, "text": "(Worobey et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1483, "text": "(Katzourakis et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1643, "end": 1667, "text": "(Keckesova et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1668, "end": 1693, "text": "van der Loo et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2039, "text": "(Gilbert and Feschotte, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2284, "end": 2297, "text": "Holmes, 2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2418, "end": 2449, "text": "(Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2491, "end": 2512, "text": "(Belyi et al., 2010a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2513, "end": 2543, "text": "Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3306, "end": 3319, "text": "(Parrish 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 3362, "end": 3387, "text": "(Shackelton et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 3654, "end": 3685, "text": "(Katzourakis and Tristem, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1998, "end": 2007, "text": "(Figure 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2544, "end": 2553, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "EVEs and the Time Scale of Viral Evolution"}, {"text": "The presence of EVEs has unequivocally shown that some viral families are far older than inferred from the analysis of contemporary virus sequences. Although it has always been likely that viruses are ancient, and there is growing evidence that viruses are descendants of replicating elements that existed during a precellular world (Holmes, 2011; Koonin et al., 2006) , it is perhaps surprising that some extant families of RNA virus arose so very long ago. In particular, as most exogenous RNA viruses evolve extremely rapidly, those viruses that existed millions of years ago and fossilized as EVEs would be expected to be unrecognizably divergent from their contemporary relatives, such that no meaningful multiple sequence alignment, let alone phylogenetic analysis, could be undertaken (Holmes, 2003a) . However, that this is demonstrably not the case with the EVEs obtained to date (while acknowledging that more divergent EVEs might not be detected) raises the question of how ancient viruses can be so relatively well conserved in sequence. Of course, it is this sequence conservation that makes most molecular clock analyses give very recent dates of viral origin. Reconciling these profoundly different time scales for viral evolution-generally recent from the analysis of contemporary viral sequences, and usually ancient from the analysis of endogenous viruses-is one of the most pressing questions in studies of virus evolution and is likely to require new models of nucleotide and amino acid substitution that recognize the intricacies of viral evolution (Holmes, 2003a; Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond, 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 333, "end": 347, "text": "(Holmes, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 348, "end": 368, "text": "Koonin et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 792, "end": 807, "text": "(Holmes, 2003a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1585, "text": "(Holmes, 2003a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1586, "end": 1621, "text": "Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "EVEs and the Time Scale of Viral Evolution"}, {"text": "Inference of the time scale of EVE evolution may also shed light on some other interesting problems in viral evolution and epidemiology.

There are, for example, over 220 gene loci in the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (The MHC Sequencing Consortium 1999) , which exhibit considerable allelic variation, and positive selection is routinely detected in genes involved in immune responses (Yang and Bielawski, 2000) .
