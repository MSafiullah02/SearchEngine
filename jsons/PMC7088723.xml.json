After virus adsorption for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, infected and control cells (without virus) were diluted with culture growth medium to a concentration of 5 \u00d7 10 cells/ml and added to the wells of 96-well culture plates. The appropriate wells were then supplemented with solutions of the study compounds (three for each dilution). The final concentrations of study compounds in cell suspensions ranged from 0.1 to 100 \u03bcg/ml.",

The experimental data were used to plot dose-response curves and to identify the quantitative characteristics of inhibition in terms of the ID50, i.e., the concentration of compounds suppressing virus production by 50% or providing 50% protection of cells from death due to infection, the ID90, i.e., the concentration of compounds suppressing virus production by 90% or providing 90% protection of cells from death due to infection, and the IS, i.e., the index of selectivity, which was the ratio of the toxic dose CD50 to the effective dose ID50.",
