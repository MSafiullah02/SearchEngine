            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important disease of swine characterized by abortion, stillbirth and weak-born pigs. In its non-reproductive form, this syndrome affects younger pigs more severely than older animals, causing reduced growth and pneumonia that can be made more severe by co-infection with other pathogens (Thacker, 2003). The etiologic agent for this disease is an RNA virus (PRRSV) that belongs to the family Arteriviridae, which targets macrophages for infection (Wensvoort et al., 1991, Collins et al., 1992). PRRSV exhibits a significant degree of genetic diversification (Murtaugh et al., 1998, Key et al., 2001, Goldberg et al., 2003) and this characteristic probably contributes to the difficulty in controlling infectious outbreaks caused by it (Meng, 2000). Under experimental conditions, the currently available modified live virus (MLV) vaccine against this pathogen has been shown to provide immunized pigs adequate protection from subsequent challenge with the homologous strain (Lager et al., 1997a, Lager et al., 1997b). However, despite the demonstrated ability of this vaccine to afford pigs partial protection against infection by a genetically divergent PRRSV strain (Osorio et al., 1998, Lager et al., 1999, Mengeling et al., 2003a, Mengeling et al., 2003b), the overall protective immunity provided to swine in commercial settings is generally inadequate (Halbur, 2003).",

In contrast, a transient T cell mediated PRRSV-specific lymphoproliferative response is detected at 4 weeks post-infection and lasts an additional 9 (Bautista and Molitor, 1997) to 14 weeks (Lopez-Fuertes et al., 1999). Moreover, during this time interval, limited quantities of IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells (SC) are also generated (Meier et al., 2003, Xiao et al., 2004). Interestingly, in the absence of additional antigenic stimulation this polarity reverses within the ensuing 5 months, as manifested by a decreasing antibody response and a gradual increase in the intensity of the IFN-\u03b3 response (Meier et al., 2003). The initial antibody-dominated immune response is not the result of insufficient antigenic stimulation, since neither the inclusion of a commercial adjuvant during primary vaccination (Meier et al., 2003) nor booster immunizations of previously heavily vaccinated pigs (Bassaganya-Riera et al., 2004) enhances virus-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI). Thus, PRRSV seems to inherently stimulate an imbalanced immune response characterized by an abundance of humoral immunity and a limited, but potentially protective, Th 1-like IFN-\u03b3 response (Murtaugh et al., 2002).",

            "text": "One characteristic of PRRSV infection that probably contributes to the retarded development of a specific cell-mediated immune response is the lack of induced IFN-\u03b1 production (Albina et al., 1998a, Buddaert et al., 1998, Van Reeth et al., 1999). Usually, virus-infected cells secrete type I IFN and the released cytokine interacts with a subset of na\u00efve T cells to promote their conversion into virus-specific IFN-\u03b3 SC (Cella et al., 2000, Cousens et al., 1999, Kadowaki et al., 2000, Biron, 2001, Levy et al., 2003). However, to counteract a virus that is a poor inducer of type I IFN, the development of a Th 1 response can be generated by a pathway that utilizes interleukin (IL)-12 (Cousens et al., 1999, Biron, 2001). Indeed, the injection of recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12) at the time of vaccination and three additional times during the following week enhanced the host cellular immune response to PRRSV (Foss et al., 2002). Based on the success of this intervention and the noted absence of IFN-\u03b1 generation during PRRSV infection, the present studies were undertaken to determine if the antiviral adaptive immunity induced by vaccination with PRRS MLV could be modified simply by the co-administration of rIL-12 protein directly, or of either porcine IFN-\u03b1 or IL-12 indirectly via plasmids expressing these cytokines. In addition to these two elements that can deliver Th 1 polarizing signals (Biron, 2001, Kadowaki and Liu, 2002, Kapsenberg, 2003), the effect of stimulation with a known inducer of IFN-\u03b1 production, namely double-stranded RNA, was examined. Although all three adjuvants positively influenced the intensity and rate of development of the virus-specific IFN-\u03b3 response, the results indicate that a stronger immunomodulator will be needed to overcome the tendency of PRRSV not to elicit this type of Th 1 response.",

The highly virulent, \u201catypical\u201d PRRSV strain IA-1-4-2 (97-7895, GenBank accession number AF325691) was originally isolated from a severe case of reproductive failure in an Iowa swine herd in 1996 (Osorio et al., 2002) and was used as the challenge virus in the animal studies. The extent of nucleotide sequence identity in ORF5 between this wild-type strain and the parental strain of the vaccine (VR2332) used in this study is approximately 91%. For ELISPOT assays of PRRSV-specific IFN-\u03b3 SC, PRRSV strains VR-2332 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and IA-1-4-2 were used as sources of antigen. When required, PRRSV was propagated and titrated in monolayers of MARC-145 cells as previously described (Meier et al., 2003).",

            "text": "For generating a plasmid capable of expressing IFN-\u03b1 in mammalian hosts, an intact cDNA encoding porcine IFN-\u03b1 was first prepared by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from pig lymphocytes previously infected with pseudorabies virus (to stimulate IFN-\u03b1 production). Forward (TCTGCAAGGTTCCCAATG) and reverse (GTCTGTCACTCCTTCTTCCTG) primers were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of porcine IFN-\u03b1 cDNA (Lefevre and La Bonnardiere, 1986). Products of the anticipated size (590 bp) were cloned into the pCR\u00ae2.1 plasmid (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), and an insert having the predicted restriction enzyme sites was sequenced. A comparison of the coding region within the selected amplicon to the previously reported IFN-\u03b1 cDNA revealed three nucleotide differences. These variations resulted in two amino acid changes of a tyrosine to a cysteine at position 109 and of an arginine to a leucine at position 141 of the intact protein. The IFN-\u03b1 cDNA was then excised from the recombinant pCR\u00ae2.1 plasmid and placed under the transcriptional regulation of the cytomegalovirus promoter in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate pINA. To verify that an active cytokine was encoded by the amplified cDNA, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with pINA and single cell clones resistant to 1.0 mg geneticin per ml growth medium were prepared. Supernatant medium from the clones were tested for the ability to inhibit the replication of an interferon-inducer negative strain of vesicular stomatitis virus (Sekellick and Marcus, 1979) in Madin Derby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells as previously described (Rubinstein et al., 1981). Clones producing from 0 to greater than 200,000 units (1 unit inhibits 50% of VSV replication in MDBK cell monolayers) of IFN-\u03b1 were detected.",

Murtaugh, University of Minnesota) that contains approximately the 5\u2032 half of IL-12 p40 subunit cDNA. This fragment was then inserted into pcDNA3 and ligated to a segment that was excised from the yeast expression plasmid pPic9scIL-12 (Foss et al., 1999) and consisted of the remainder of the IL-12 p40 subunit cDNA linked by a 45 nucleotide stretch to cDNA encoding the mature form of the IL-12 p35 subunit. The resultant plasmid, pcPIL12, utilizes the cytomegalovirus promoter to regulate expression of a complete IL-12 complex consisting of one of each of the two subunits. To verify that a biologically active, secreted cytokine could be produced by pcPIL12, CHO cells were either mock-transfected or transfected with the plasmid and after 48 h the overlaying medium was subjected to a bioassay designed to demonstrate the presence of porcine IL-12 based on its ability to increase the IFN-\u03b3 response of memory T cells to recall viral antigen (Meier et al., 2000). By comparison to a yeast-derived porcine rIL-12 standard (provided by Dr. M. Moody, Endogen, Woburn, MA), >100 ng/ml bioactive cytokine was found in the transfected cell medium whereas no activity was found to be associated with the control supernatant.",

Immediately prior to challenge with the virulent PRRSV IA-1-4-2 strain at 8 weeks post-vaccination, VN antibodies were not detected in serum collected from any member of the three cohorts being challenged (MLV only, MLV + pcPIL12 i.m., and MLV + pINA i.m.; Fig. 3\n).

Despite use of the challenge strain in lieu of PRRSV isolate VR-2332 as an antigen source appearing to result in a slightly more sensitive assay for the presence of VN antibody, this visual difference was determined not to be statistically significant. As expected due to the short interval between exposure to virus and performance of the assay, PRRSV-neutralizing antibodies were not detected in the sera of the challenged, non-vaccinated pigs.",

However, despite the positive modulation of Th 1 immunity, no significant alteration in the development of the humoral immune response was observed. Thus, even with such intervention at the initiation of PRRSV immunization, the usual rapid onset of anti-PRRSV antibody production and delayed appearance of VN antibodies (Labarque et al., 2000, Ostrowski et al., 2002, Meier et al., 2003) still occurred. Although in previous studies a similar increased presence of PRRSV-specific IFN-\u03b3 SC was afforded to pigs receiving multiple injections of IL-12 at the time of vaccination and during the ensuing week (Foss et al., 2002), the use of a conventional oil-in-water adjuvant was found to be ineffective in this regard (Meier et al., 2003). Moreover, in that study, even though this compound demonstrably enhanced the genesis of VN antibodies recognizing pseudorabies virus in addition to specific IFN-\u03b3 SC, the intensity of either type of immune response to PRRSV was not affected. Apparently PRRSV possesses inherent structural elements that prevent the timely development of protective innate or adaptive immunity capable of inhibiting its infectious process. Thus, the ultimate outcome of the interaction between this virus and its host will be determined by the elicited host response which is highly variable, as evidenced by the inconsistency of the clinical outcomes seen upon challenge of na\u00efve or immune pigs with PRRSV (Labarque et al., 2003, Mengeling et al., 2003a, Mengeling et al., 2003b). This is likely due to the significant variability within the swine population in regards to their innate and adaptive immune responses to PRRSV (Xiao et al., 2004, Royaee et al., 2004).",

            "text": "The ability of PRRSV to not initially elicit protective immunity in an infected host is relatively novel among viruses that even after being inactivated can usually still promote a Th 1-like response (de Wit et al., 2004). In this regard it is notable that the IFN-\u03b1 response to exposure to PRRSV is nearly non-existent. For example, IFN-\u03b1 production in the lungs of pigs acutely infected with PRRSV was either almost undetectable, or 159-fold lower than that induced by another pathogen, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) (Buddaert et al., 1998, Van Reeth et al., 1999). Such lack of efficient stimulation of IFN-\u03b1 production by a pathogen has a significant impact on the nature of the host's adaptive immune response, since IFN-\u03b1 up-regulates IFN-\u03b3 gene expression, and thus controls the dominant pathway that promotes the development of adaptive immunity, namely, T cell-mediated IFN-\u03b3 responses and peak antiviral immune defenses (Cousens et al., 1997, Levy et al., 2003). In this regard, it has become evident that the link between innate and adaptive immunity in viral infections occurs through the interaction of dendritic cells with type I interferon (Montoya et al., 2002, Tough, 2004) and the dendritic-cell controlled polarization of T-cell function (Kapsenberg, 2003). The production of IFN-\u03b1 by plasmacytoid dendritic cells/natural IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-producing cells (NIPC) has an autocrine effect that promotes their functional and phenotypic activation, which is necessary for their optimal expression of co-stimulatory molecules and subsequent ability to cause na\u00efve T cells to differentiate into IFN-\u03b3-SC (Cella et al., 2000, Kadowaki et al., 2000, Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 2002, Montoya et al., 2002, Honda et al., 2003). Presumably, PRRSV is a poor inducer of IFN-\u03b1 production by NIPCs since unlike transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Charley and Lavenant, 1990, Nowacki et al., 1993) and type-A CpG oligonucleotides (Guzylack-Piriou et al., 2004) it fails to stimulate the secretion of IFN-\u03b1 from cultured porcine PBMC (Albina et al., 1998a; Zuckermann et al., unpublished observations). Thus, direct examination of the outcome of the interaction of PRRSV with porcine NIPCs will likely reveal important information on the immunobiology of this virus, especially since this virus is susceptible to the antiviral effects of IFN-\u03b1 (Albina et al., 1998a). The application of molecular tools such as real-time PCR assays to measure the expression of key immune mediators that regulate the development of Th 1 responses in swine (Dawson et al., 2004) will be particularly useful in this endeavor.",

Thus, two alternative routes (IL-12- or type I IFN-dependent) can lead to an adaptive Th 1 cell-mediated immune response with potent antiviral effects (Biron, 2001). According to a scenario involving the presence of less than a requisite amount of IFN-\u03b1, IL-12 could provide the necessary impetus for the development of an anti-viral IFN-\u03b3 response. In this regard, IL-12 mRNA has been detected in porcine macrophages infected with PRRSV (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2001), and transiently in the lungs of PRRSV-infected pigs (Chung and Chae, 2003). However, this pathogen is also apparently a poor stimulator of IL-12 production, since a negligible quantity of IL-12 mRNA or protein was produced by porcine PBMC exposed in vitro to PRRSV (Royaee et al., 2004; Zuckermann et al., unpublished observations). The observation that the inclusion of either IL-12 and IFN-\u03b1 during immunization increased the intensity of the IFN-\u03b3 response to PRRSV validates the proposed role of these two innate cytokines in directing the in vivo differentiation of swine Th 1 cells, and helps explain the poor virus-specific IFN-\u03b3 response that normally develops as a result of the exposure of pigs to PRRSV (Meier et al., 2003, Xiao et al., 2004).",

            "text": "To compensate for the lack of stimulation of innate cytokine expression by PRRSV, novel adjuvants have been used during immunization. The administration of IL-12 in combination with a live or killed PRRSV vaccine resulted in an increased lymphoproliferative response to this virus (Wee et al., 2001). Inclusion of either a combination of IL-1 and IL-6 or cholera toxin correlated with an enhanced response to PRRSV but only at 6 weeks after the initial exposure (Foss et al., 2002). Moreover, in that study, the frequency of virus-specific IFN-\u03b3 SC did transiently increase between 2 and 3 weeks post-vaccination of pigs also injected with porcine rIL-12. Although similar results were obtained in the current study, albeit after biolistic injection of expressible IL-12 cDNA in lieu of protein, the provision of IFN-\u03b1 cDNA had a more pronounced and sustained effect on the intensity of the cell-mediated immune response. It was notable that the i.d. administration of IL-12 cDNA with a gene gun was more successful at enhancing the vaccine-induced IFN-\u03b3 response than the i.m. injection of the same plasmid. This observation is in agreement with the reported higher efficiency of in vivo DNA transfection by biolistic delivery (Fynan et al., 1993, Colosimo et al., 2000). The greater effectiveness of the plasmid encoding IFN-\u03b1 rather than IL-12 at enticing an IFN-\u03b3 response could be attributed to the relatively low amounts of complete IL-12 receptor on swine lymphocytes and the limited up-regulation of expression of the IL-12 receptor \u00df2 subunit gene as compared to other species (Solano-Aguilar et al., 2002). In this regard, it should be noted that the injection of bioactive IL-12 into na\u00efve pigs did not stimulate a strong T cell response (Solano-Aguilar et al., 2002). Likewise, the introduction of a known inducer of IFN-\u03b1 production in pigs, poly I:C (Derbyshire and Lesnick, 1990), during vaccination temporarily amplified the quantities of PRRSV-specific IFN-\u03b3 SC, but was not as efficient as the IFN-\u03b1 encoding plasmid at enhancing the IFN-\u03b3 response to the vaccine. This difference could be attributed to the presence of immunostimulatory CpG motifs in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3, which was used in this study to express the cytokine genes, and has been shown to induce IFN-\u03b3 expression by porcine leukocytes (Magnusson et al., 2001). It is plausible that the combination of direct stimulation of NIPC by the CpG motifs in the IFN-\u03b1-encoding plasmid, presumably through their toll-like receptor 9 (Shimosato et al., 2003), in combination with the plasmid-driven production of IFN-\u03b1 would provide the necessary stimulatory signals to promote the maturation of dendritic cells and the creation of a microenvironment conducive for a sustained IFN-\u03b3 response to PRRSV. Although poly I:C induces IFN-\u03b1 production, it does not entice porcine NIPC to differentiate (Guzylack-Piriou et al., 2004), and thus might not provide enough impetus to promote a sustained T-cell-mediated IFN-\u03b3 response to this virus. This notion is in agreement with the role attributed to CpG-containing oligonucleotides in promoting the maturation of NIPC in humans (Krug et al., 2001) and swine (Guzylack-Piriou et al., 2004).",

The notion of an structural inherent property unique to PRRSV that deters the elicitation of a strong VN antibody response is in accord with the observation that in the case of PRRSV-neutralizing antibodies, the close association of a nearby N-glycan with a recognized epitope in the virus's envelope glycoprotein 5 may impede neutralization of this virus (Plagemann et al., 2002). In addition, decoy epitopes that delay the development of VN antibodies also exist (Ostrowski et al., 2002). Remarkably, as we have shown here, the titer of VN antibodies increased equally in all vaccinated groups as a result of the pigs being challenged with a genetically divergent, virulent virus. Similarly, augmented titers of VN antibodies against PRRSV have been observed in pigs previously vaccinated with PRRS MLV after they received a booster immunization with an inactivated genetically divergent virus but not when exposed to the same attenuated virus (Osorio et al., 1998, Bassaganya-Riera et al., 2004).",

            "text": "As compared to the control (PRRSV na\u00efve) pigs, a lower proportion of those vaccinated with PRRS MLV exhibited viremia at 4 and 7 days after challenge. However, no further reduction was observed in animals also receiving either IL-12 or IFN-\u03b1. Rather, injection of pINA increased the percentage of viremic pigs, although the mean virus titer in their sera was intermediate between those values determined for the vaccinated and un-vaccinated groups at 4 days after challenge. The significance of this observation with regards to protective immunity is unclear. This is due to the fact that while vaccination can decrease the duration and magnitude of viremia following an experimental challenge (van Woensel et al., 1998, Verheije et al., 2003), the reduction in viremia is not necessarily associated with commensurate amelioration of the severity of other clinical parameters associated with PRRS such as a lessened rate of weight gain, fever, respiratory distress or virus transmission to sentinel pigs (Nodelijk et al., 2001, Labarque et al., 2003, Mengeling et al., 2003a). A similar lack of correlation between viremia and clinical signs was also noted when two different age groups of non-immune pigs were infected with PRRSV. Whereas a greater frequency of viremia with an accompanying higher virus titer was found in the younger animals (2 months of age), the older pigs (6 months of age) exhibited more severe clinical signs (van der Linden et al., 2003). The difficulty of deciphering PRRSV biology is further revealed by the marked degree of variability and irreproducibility of consecutive trials conducted by the same investigators (Labarque et al., 2003, Mengeling et al., 2003a, Mengeling et al., 2003b). Moreover, although a positive association between protection from disease and the intensity of the IFN-\u03b3 response in swine has been observed in regard to pseudorabies virus (Zuckermann et al., 1998, Zuckermann et al., 1999, Van Rooij et al., 2004), a similar relationship concerning PRRSV was not apparent from the results of this study. Thus, the identification of an immunologic mechanism responsible for mediating protective immunity against PRRSV poses a significant challenge and will perhaps require monitoring the extent of reproductive failure caused by this virus as a measurement of the degree of protection (Lager et al., 1999). Notably, in recent, related field studies we have noticed a positive correlation between the reduction of abortion/still births in sows and the relative frequency of PRRSV-specific IFN-\u03b3 SC in their blood (Lowe et al., 2004). In any event, perhaps a more marked enhancement of the vaccine-induced IFN-\u03b3 response will be needed in order to improve protective immunity against PRRSV as we found to be the case when IL-12 was used as an adjuvant for an inactivated pseudorabies virus vaccine, which like the PRRS MLV vaccine stimulates a weak IFN-\u03b3 response (Zuckermann et al., 1998).",

            "text": "Clearly, further studies will be required to clarify how the outcome of a PRRSV infection is influenced by the intensity of the IFN-\u03b3 response by memory T cells. Nevertheless, the potential importance of eliciting a strong IFN-\u03b3 response against this pathogen might not be limited to preventing virus replication (Bautista and Molitor, 1999, Rowland et al., 2001). Since IFN-\u03b3 can restrain B cell differentiation and even polyclonal B cell activation (Cowdery and Fleming, 1992), it is reasonable to propose that a strong IFN-\u03b3 response could mediate protective immunity by thwarting the polyclonal B cell activation that is associated with PRRSV infection and results in immunopathology (Lemke et al., 2004). The uncontrolled B cell activation induced by PRRSV could also contribute to the observed weak cell-mediated immune response, since activated B cells can release IL-10 (Burdin et al., 1997), a cytokine that inhibits both IFN-\u03b3 production by porcine T cells (Waters et al., 1999), and IFN-\u03b1 synthesis by human PBMC in response to viral stimulation (Payvandi et al., 1998). In the accompanying manuscript (Royaee et al., 2004) we demonstrate that PBMC obtained from pigs at 2 weeks after immunization with PRRS MLV spontaneously secrete IL-1, IL-6, and IL-10 and that the production of these cytokines are indeed affected by the administration, at the time of vaccination, of the same IFN-\u03b1 expressing plasmid utilized in the present study. Such repression may be critical since unabated PRRSV infection will actually stimulate synthesis of IL-6 (Asai et al., 1999), a known inhibitor of Th 1 cell development (Diehl and Rincon, 2002) and promoter of polyclonal immunoglobulin production following B cell activation by the murine arterivirus, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (Markine-Goriaynoff et al., 2001).",

The need to develop such methodology is made palpable by the unusual kinetics of the immune response to this virus, as evidenced by the lack of a marked CMI response upon vaccination and subsequent challenge with virulent virus. The IFN-\u03b3 response to PRRSV therefore appears to be determined at the time of the first exposure to this pathogen and is only minimally affected by re-exposure. Although it is also possible that we did not monitor the immune response long enough post-challenge to detect a significant increase in the number of virus-specific IFN-\u03b3 SC, this is unlikely since in the accompanying manuscript a similar minimal enhancement was observed when the immune response was measured for up to 5 weeks after a booster immunization (Royaee et al., 2004). In addition, similar limited changes in the IFN-\u03b3 response have been observed upon challenge of vaccinated pigs with wild-type virus (Foss et al., 2002) or booster immunization with MLV vaccine (Meier et al., 2003). Remarkably, the T-cell proliferative response to PRRSV was also not increased by a booster immunization in pigs that had previously been repeatedly exposed to a MLV vaccine, but rather appeared to be suppressed as compared to that elicited by the same vaccine in na\u00efve pigs (Bassaganya-Riera et al., 2004). The mechanism responsible for this unusual effect is currently unknown, but might be related to the persistence of the virus in lymphoid tissues associated with the site of infection (Xiao et al., 2004). Such sustained presence of virus could adversely affect a subsequent response due to an inherent and yet unknown property of PRRSV.",

The molecular pathway responsible for generating this type of immunity is unknown at this time, but based on the results presented it likely involves the limited induction of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-12 production and/or inherent structural elements of the virus that promote such a response. We propose that the strong humoral immunity bias of the host response to PRRSV is mostly responsible for the difficulties in the development of a vaccine deemed effective in the field. Although our use of porcine cytokines, especially IFN-\u03b1, as adjuvants did not radically affect PRRSV's inherent ability to promote this type of polarized immunity, a positive impact on the transition of T lymphocytes to IFN-\u03b3 SC was noticed. The limited up-regulation of cellular IFN-\u03b3 responses (presented here) or gene expression (described in the accompanying paper, Royaee et al., 2004) indicates that more substantial stimulants of innate immunity are to modify the host response to PRRSV. Perhaps a more potent immunomodulator, such as type A CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (Klinman, 2004), will overcome the tendency of PRRSV to stimulate a strong non-neutralizing antibody response and simultaneously promote a Th 1 (IFN-\u03b3 dominated) response.",

Groups of pigs were vaccinated with PRRS MLV alone (group 1) or also received i.m. injections of plasmid expressing porcine IFN-\u03b1 (group 2) or IL-12 (group 3), i.d. injections of plasmid expressing porcine IL-12 (group 4), or 2 i.m. injections of porcine rIL-12 at a daily interval (group 5). An additional group served as unvaccinated controls (group 6). At 8 weeks post-immunization, vaccinated animals in groups 1\u20133 as well as five, newly acquired PRRSV-na\u00efve pigs (challenge control, group 7) were challenged with PRRSV strain IA-1-4-2.
