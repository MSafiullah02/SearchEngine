According to the results obtained both in vitro and in vivo, good perspectives have been opened for quercetin. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to better characterize the mechanisms of action underlying the beneficial effects of quercetin on inflammation and immunity.",

            "text": "Quercetin is categorized as a flavonol, one of the six subclasses of flavonoid compounds. The name has been used since 1857, and is derived from quercetum (oak forest), after Quercus. It is a naturally occurring polar auxin transport inhibitor [3] . The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature for quercetin is 3, 3 1 , 4 1 , 5, 7-pentahydroxyflvanone (or its synonym 3, 3 1 , 4 1 , 5, 7-pentahydroxy-2-phenylchromen-4-one). This means that quercetin has an OH group attached at positions 3, 5, 7, 3 1 , and 4 1 . Common forms of quercetin were shown in Figure 1 . Quercetin (C15H10O7) is an aglycone, lacking an attached sugar. It is a brilliant citron yellow needle crystal and entirely insoluble in cold water, poorly soluble in hot water, but quite soluble in alcohol and lipids. A quercetin glycoside is formed by attaching a glycosyl group (a sugar such as glucose, rhamnose, or rutinose) as a replacement for one of the OH groups (commonly at position 3). The attached glycosyl group can change the solubility, absorption, and in vivo effects. As a general rule of thumb, the presence of a glycosyl group (quercetin glycoside) results in increased water solubility compared to quercetin aglycone [4, 5] .",

The estimated flavonoid intake ranges from 50 to 800 mg/day (quercetin accounts for 75%), mostly depending on the consumption of fruits and vegetables and the intake of tea [14] . In the Suihua area of northern China, quercetin intake was reported to be 4.37 mg/day, where the main food sources of flavonol was apples (7.4%), followed by potatoes (3.9%), lettuce (3.8%) and oranges (3.8%) [15] , whereas the average quercetin intake was 4.43 mg/day, with apple (3.7%), potato (2.5%), celery (2.2%), eggplant (2.2%), and actinidia (1.6%) being the main food sources of quercetin in Harbin, China [16] . The most recent study showed that quercetin intake is about 18 mg/day for Chinese healthy young males. In the USA, flavonol intake is about 13 mg/day for U.S. adults, while quercetin represents three-quarters of this amount. The mean quercetin intake was approximately 14.90 to 16.39 mg per day. Onions, tea, and apples contained high amounts of quercetin [17] . In Japan, the average and median quercetin intakes were 16.2 and 15.5 mg/day, respectively; the quercetin intake by men was lower than that by women; and the quercetin intakes showed a low correlation with age in both men and women. The estimated quercetin intake was similar during summer and winter. Quercetin was mainly ingested from onions and green tea, both in summer and in winter. Vegetables, such as asparagus, green pepper, tomatoes, and red leaf lettuce, were good sources of quercetin in summer [18] . In Australia, black and green teas were the dominant sources of quercetin. Other sources included onion, broccoli, apple, grape, and beans [19] . Analysis of the 24-h recall data indicated an average adult intake of total flavonoids (>18 years) of 454 mg/day. Apple was the most important source of quercetin until age 16-18 years, after which onion became an increasingly important prominent source [19] . In Spain, the average daily intake of quercetin is 18.48 mg/day, which is significantly higher than that in the United States (9.75 mg/day), based on sources like tea, citrus fruits and juice, beers and ales, wines, melon, apples, onions, berries and bananas [20] .",

The glucosides are efficiently hydrolyzed in the small intestine by beta-glucosidases to the aglycone form, much of which is then absorbed [22] . Quercetin glucuronic acid and its sulfuric acid derivatives were more easily absorbed than quercetin [22] . Thereafter, its absorption is affected by differences in its glycosylation, the food matrix from which it is consumed, and the co-administration of dietary components such as fiber and fat [23] .

Moreover, in glial cells it was even shown that quercetin can inhibit LPS-induced mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1, this effect of quercetin resulted in a diminished apoptotic neuronal cell death induced by microglial activation [47] . Quercetin inhibits production of inflammation-producing enzymes (cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX)) [48, 49] . It limits LPS-induced inflammation via inhibition of Src-and Syk-mediated phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase (PI3K)-(p85) tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4)/MyD88/PI3K complex formation that limits activation of downstream signaling pathways in RAW 264.7 cells [50] . It can also inhibit Fc\u03b5RI-mediated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tryptase and histamine from human umbilical cord blood-derived cultured mast cells (hCBMCs); this inhibition appears to involve in inhibition of calcium influx, as well as phospho-protein kinase C (PKC) [51] . The study of quercetin against H 2 O 2 -induced inflammation showed the protective effects of quercetin against inflammation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and indicated that the effect was mediated via the downregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and CD80 expression [52] .",
