Then, a decremental PEEP trial was performed starting from 20 and decreasing to 6 cmH2O in 2-min steps of 2 cmH2O. Driving pressure was maintained constant at 14 cmH2O. Overdistention and collapse percentages at each PEEP level were calculated, as previously described [17, 20]. Thus, optimal PEEP, i.e., the lowest sum of collapse and overdistension percentages [17], was identified and applied throughout the protocol. A similar PP PEEP trial was repeated after 16 h of PP (i.e., just before returning on supine) to compare their optimal PEEP levels. In case of similar results for 2 different PEEP levels, the one with collapse to 15% or less while maintaining the lowest percentage of overdistention was selected [17].",

Briefly, lung images were divided into two symmetrical non-overlapping ventral and dorsal horizontal regions of interest (ROIs) [15]. The vertical height of these ROIs was the same, corresponding to 50% of the anteroposterior diameter. At each protocol step, we recorded impedance variation (\u0394z) (i.e., well-correlated with VT [15]), local compliance variation [20], which is calculated dividing local volume variation (based on impedance variation obtained with EIT) by the driving pressure, VTdorsal/VTglobal (i.e., expressed as the percentage of \u0394z located in dorsal regions) [22\u201325], and end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) (i.e., well-correlated with variations of end-expiratory global and regional lung volumes [26]). Notably, because the relationship between EELI and end-expiratory global and regional lung volumes is not linear [26], EELI cannot be accurately transposed into regional or global end-expiratory lung volumes values. Out-of-phase regions (with a decreased of impedance during inflation, leading to negative values of \u0394z), were excluded of analysis [27, 28] (details are provided in the Supplemental Digital Content).",

We performed a subgroup analysis differentiating patients with a compliance gain (PCG+) after 16 h of PP, defined by an increase \u2265 3 mL/cmH2O compared to baseline (i.e., SP) [9, 10, 29], and patients with no compliance gain (PCG\u2212). We arbitrarily chose that definition by considering that a VT increase of > 40 mL after PP would be more likely to represent a \u201ctrue\u201d compliance gain rather than an inherent measurement variability, which could not be excluded with a smaller VT increase on ECMO. Consequently, a compliance increase of \u2265 3 mL/cmH2O with driving pressure at 14 cmH2O would result in a VT gain of \u2265 42 mL.",

Indeed, baseline tidal impedance were mostly distributed in ventral ROIs only in PCG+ . This finding suggests a collapse of the dorsal lung ROIs and functional aerated ventral ROIs in PCG+ , whereas ventral ROIs were over distended in PCG\u2212 at baseline. Consistently, previous observations reported that PaCO2-based beneficial PP effects mainly depend on the lung recruitment/derecruitment ratio [11, 33]. In addition, EIT-determined local compliance increased at a higher percentage than global compliance, suggesting a potential negative PP impact on another lung ROI, not captured by EIT at this thoracic level. Pertinently, Bikker et al. described different EIT-pattern responses to a PEEP trial when they were evaluated at two different thoracic levels. Hence, it cannot be excluded that different response patterns at different thoracic levels might also occur during PP.",

Indeed, the increase of EELI in the dorsal regions was observed in all patients, as previously reported with other tools [34, 35] and in other populations. Moreover, it is worth noting that PP significantly impacted on regional VT distribution and optimal PEEP levels in all patients, regardless of their static compliance modifications. Our study suggests that global static compliance or gas exchanges are not good surrogate of the impact of PP on regional ventilation. Indeed, improvement of local compliance, VT and EELI redistribution, were observed even for patients with lower global static compliance at the end of PP. Our preliminary results suggest striving to prone all ECMO-supported ARDS patients regardless their predicted response in terms of static compliance improvement. These results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that PP benefits are independent of the oxygenation/decarboxylation responses [10] and may be more related to less VILIs.",

This distinction might explain the differences between local and global compliance variations reported herein. Second, we chose to apply a 16-h PP session, as described by Guerin et al. [7]. However, our findings cannot rule out that the PP impact could evolve beyond 16 h, enhancing the PP impact on local and global ventilation. That hypothesis was also supported by Kimmoun et al.\u2019s observations, after subjecting 17 severe ARDS patients on VV-ECMO to one or more 24-h PP sessions [14]. In this study, patients exhibited major compliance improvement that persisted 24 h after returning to SP. Third, we defined optimal PEEP as the best compromise between lowest overdistension and collapse, as previously described [20]. We cannot exclude that different optimal PEEP identification methods, e.g., inhomogeneity index [38] or dependent silent spaces [39], would have yielded different results. However, we can acknowledge that the selected optimal PEEP\u2019s influence on our results was probably limited because ventilator settings were unchanged throughout the entire protocol. Lastly, our study enrolled relatively few patients and our promising results need to be confirmed in larger studies.",
