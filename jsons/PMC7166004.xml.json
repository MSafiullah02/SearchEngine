SBMA is caused by a CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) tract expansion in the androgen receptor (AR), placing it into a family of nine degenerative disorders with similar mutations, including Huntington disease, dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy, and six autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17) [37, 62]. PolyQ tract expansion leads to both loss of normal AR function as a transcription factor and ligand-dependent proteotoxicity. These changes ultimately lead to dysregulation of pathways critical for normal cellular function [36, 46, 50, 54, 64, 70].",

            "text": "While neuronal dysfunction in SBMA remains an active field of study, several lines of evidence have established skeletal muscle tissue as a key contributor to disease pathogenesis. SBMA patients develop progressive muscular weakness and concomitantly display signs of muscle toxicity, including evidence of myopathy on muscle biopsy and elevated serum creatine kinase levels above what is found in diseases of pure denervation [5, 65, 74]. Isolated skeletal muscle satellite cells show impairments in fusion to form myotubes, demonstrating cell-autonomous toxicity in muscle [42]. Knock-in mice expressing polyQ AR under the endogenous mouse promotor develop myopathy months before spinal cord pathology, with atrophy of both type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers and polyQ AR intranuclear aggregates in skeletal muscle within the first 3\u20134 months of age [14, 26, 66, 83]. Aggregates within spinal motor neurons of the anterior horn are visualized by 24 months of age [83]. Transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type (WT) AR only in skeletal muscle show hormone-dependent myopathy and motor axon loss; similar effects are seen in mice overexpressing polyQ AR only in muscle [49, 63]. Additionally, overexpression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in muscle ameliorates the phenotypic severity of SBMA transgenic mice [57]. The contribution of muscle to the SBMA phenotype is further corroborated by studies demonstrating that knockdown of peripheral polyQ AR or conditional deletion of polyQ AR only in skeletal muscle rescues disease in mice [17, 38].",

We identify impaired function of the transcription factor Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2), a well-established modulator of myofiber homeostasis and hypertrophy [51], as a novel contributor to muscle atrophy caused by polyQ AR. We demonstrate that changes in MEF2 function are age- and hormone-dependent and occur as a result of ligand-mediated proteotoxicity. We find that impairment of MEF2 also occurs in skeletal muscle of R6/2 mice, a model of Huntington disease where muscle atrophy is prominent. Finally, we demonstrate that SBMA patient muscle biopsies lose expression of MEF2 target genes, and that restoring MEF2 activity rescues mouse muscle fiber size in vivo. These studies establish MEF2 as a novel therapeutic target which mediates skeletal muscle atrophy in polyglutamine disease.",

AR113Q mice express a humanized form of AR in which much of the coding sequence of mouse AR exon 1 is replaced by human sequence containing 113 CAG repeats [83, 84]. These mice express endogenous levels of polyQ AR under the control of the mouse AR gene promoter and transcriptional machinery. AR113Q males develop a progressive neuromuscular phenotype which mimics important aspects of the SBMA phenotype (Supplemetary Fig. 1) [83]. Because the AR gene is on the X chromosome, males are hemizygous for either the mutant or WT allele. Using AR113Q mice, we performed the same denervation experiment at 26 weeks and examined the gastrocnemius 3 days post-denervation (Fig. 1b). While AR113Q mice also showed significant induction of Atrogin-1 and MuSA1, MuRF1 was not significantly induced, and the amount of induction of all three genes was blunted compared to WT mice. This indicates that SBMA mice are impaired in their ability to induce the E3 ubiquitin ligases responsible for atrophy following denervation.",

We observed no induction of E3 ubiquitin ligases in comparison to either WT or AR21Q males. (AR21Q males were generated using the same gene targeting strategy but express a normal CAG repeat length [1] and thereby control for effects of humanizing the mouse AR gene). Previous work has demonstrated that AR21Q mice are phenotypically similar to WT, establishing that the neuromuscular phenotype of AR113Q mice is due solely to polyglutamine tract expansion above the pathogenic threshold [83]. Collectively, these analyses demonstrate that AR113Q mice lack induction of the classical, ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS)-based muscle atrophy machinery and suggest that alternative mechanisms underlie muscle atrophy in this disease.",

Two major signaling pathways, regulated by mTOR and myostatin, are well established in modulating skeletal muscle hypertrophy (Fig. 2a) [71]. As reduced mTOR activity is a well-established hallmark of muscle atrophy [9, 15, 55], we hypothesized that mTOR signaling may be impaired in SBMA and contributes to reduction of muscle fiber size. We examined phosphorylation of S6RP, a well-established mTORC1 target, in 14-week LABC. In contrast to expectation, we found significant upregulation of mTOR signaling in AR113Q muscle (Fig. 2b), similar to a previous report [66]. This signal was ablated by administration of rapamycin for 2 weeks, demonstrating specificity for mTOR activation (Fig. 2b). We next sought to determine if upstream regulators of mTOR were differentially affected in AR113Q mice. Two well-characterized mTOR inhibitors are Deptor [59] and Redd1 [11, 73]. AR113Q muscle displays significant reduction in levels of both Deptor and Redd1 proteins, demonstrating that loss of inhibitors coincides with significant mTOR activation (Fig. 2c). These results demonstrate that mTOR signaling is activated to favor hypertrophy in AR113Q muscle and led us to examine whether other effectors of muscle hypertrophy are dysregulated in disease.",

To determine whether myostatin induction plays a role in AR113Q muscle atrophy, we performed qPCR on 14, 26, and 52 week quadriceps. We observed no change in myostatin expression in the quadriceps at early time points but significant suppression of myostatin expression in 52 week quadriceps (Fig. 2d) and 14 week LABC (Fig. 2e). To support the notion that myostatin signaling is diminished in AR113Q muscle, we examined the level of phospho-SMAD3, a downstream effector of myostatin. We detected an age-dependent, significant decrease in phospho-SMAD3 in AR113Q muscle, supporting the conclusion that myostatin signaling is suppressed (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 2A, 2B). As both myostatin and mTOR signaling changed to favor hypertrophy rather than atrophy in mutant muscle, we conclude that alterations in these pathways do not underlie AR113Q skeletal muscle pathology.",

To accomplish this, we injected cardiotoxin (CTX) into the tibialis anterior muscle, leading to severe muscle damage and fiber destruction [6, 58]. In WT mice, muscle fibers are replenished to their original size by satellite cells 12\u201314 days after CTX administration [28, 58]. Significant destruction of muscle fibers was present in both WT and AR113Q mice at 7 days post-CTX injection (Fig. 3d), and both WT and AR113Q mice successfully regenerated muscle fibers by 14 days post-injection (Fig. 3e). Following regeneration, fibers trended larger for WT mice and were slightly, but significantly larger (6%) for AR113Q mice than their respective original sizes (Fig. 3f, left), demonstrating that AR113Q mouse satellite cells remain functional. Although fibers successfully regenerated to their original size, subtle changes in satellite cell function were suggested by the reduction in nuclei per fiber in SBMA mouse muscle (Fig. 3f, right). Similar changes have been reported in primary satellite cell cultures from SBMA patients [42]. As these defects do not prevent fiber regeneration in vivo post-injury by the muscle stem cell population, we conclude that they are unlikely to significantly contribute to AR113Q atrophy. Having determined that UPS-based degradation, impaired hypertrophic signaling, and regenerative capability do not account for reduced muscle fiber size in AR113Q mice, we sought out alternative factors which may contribute to muscle atrophy in disease.",

We performed transcription factor-binding site analysis using ToppGene to nominate transcription factors that could account for this loss of sarcomere gene transcription. Strikingly, we found that binding sites for the transcription factor Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2) account for 5 of the top 5 and 4 of the top 5 hits when analyzing differentially expressed genes in the quadriceps and LABC, respectively (Table S1-S2). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) also showed MEF2-binding sites accounting for 5 of the top 15 transcription factor-binding sites, and as the only transcription factor with multiple hits (Table S3). These results were unexpected, as MEF2 mRNA expression (Supp Fig. 3a) and protein level (Supplementary Fig. 3B) were not altered. RNAseq data also showed no significant change in expression of any Mef2 family gene (Table S4). To test whether MEF2 activity is impaired in AR113Q muscle, we electroporated a plasmid containing a MEF2 promoter site upstream of luciferase into mouse hindlimb muscle. Luciferase activity was examined 48 h post-electroporation and normalized to co-transfected, constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase. We found significant reduction of MEF2 activity in AR113Q muscle (Fig. 4a) without a difference in Renilla luciferase activity (Supplementary Fig. 3C), consistent with impaired MEF2 activity in vivo. We next compared differentially expressed genes in 14 week AR113Q quadriceps and LA/BC to a published data set of MEF2A targets in C2C12 cells which were identified by RNAseq and confirmed by MEF2A ChIP-Exo [78]. Strikingly, ~ 20% of identified MEF2 targets were altered in AR113Q quadriceps and ~ 40% of targets in AR113Q LABC (Fig. 4b). We further compared differentially expressed genes in 14 week AR113Q quadriceps and LA/BC muscles to another data set in which the MEF2 inhibitor Mrf4 was knocked down in rat tibialis anterior muscle by electroporation at 6 weeks of age and expression analysis was performed in the context of activated MEF2 [51]. We found that ~ 10% of all genes that changed upon Mrf4 knockdown were altered in AR113Q quadriceps; similarly, ~ 30% were altered in AR113Q LABC (Fig. 4c).",

This conclusion is corroborated by the observation that ASO treatment rescues expression of MEF2 targets (Fig. 4d). As ASOs diminish AR levels, changes due to loss of function are exacerbated by treatment, while those due to gain of function proteotoxicity are ameliorated. The finding that MEF2 targets are rescued by ASO administration supports the notion that loss of MEF2 function is due to polyglutamine-mediated toxicity.",

However, intrinsic disorder in a protein is also a key modulator of aggregation [20], with intrinsically disordered proteins implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation [76]. Using prediction pipelines (DisEMBL, FoldINDEX, DISpro, and PONDR-FIT), the sequence of MEF2C was found to contain regions of significant predicted disorder in the transactivating domain (Supplementary Fig. 4G). These findings suggest that MEF2 has structural features that confer an increased likelihood for co-aggregation.

This CA mutant consists of the MEF2 DNA-binding domain fused to the VP16 transactivating domain and estrogen receptor hormone binding domain; nuclear translocation and activity of this mutant is controlled by tamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. 6A) [24, 51]. In addition to its constitutively active nature, this construct has much less predicted disorder, suggesting less propensity for co-aggregation (Supplementary Fig. 6B). Consistent with this, when transiently expressed in cell culture HA-MEF2 localized to intranuclear polyQ AR aggregates (Supplementary Fig. 6C), whereas CA-MEF2 did not (Supplementary Fig. 6D). At 19 weeks of age, after AR113Q, mice show significant muscle atrophy (Supplementary Fig. 1, Fig. 3f), we electroporated CA-MEF2 into tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of one hind limb. The contralateral TA was electroporated with VP16-MEF2 containing a deletion in the DNA-binding domain (DBD-MEF2), thereby preventing transcriptional activity [24, 51]. Importantly, DBD-MEF2 does not alter muscle fiber size [51]. Following electroporation, mice were administered tamoxifen every other day for 7 days prior to harvesting muscle. We found a 24% increase in muscle fiber size owing to expression of CA-MEF2 in AR113Q muscle (Fig. 7a\u2013d). Electroporated CA-MEF2 was predominantly diffuse within the nucleus of skeletal muscle and did not colocalize with p62 + intranuclear inclusions (Supplementary Fig. 6E). Notably, this rescue of muscle fiber size was accompanied by increased expression of MEF2 target genes, including many of the same genes reduced in SBMA patient muscle biopsies (Fig. 7e). Strikingly, restoration of MEF2 activity also rescued expression of critical genes mediating metabolic dysfunction in SBMA, an important disease phenotype characterized by diminished carbohydrate metabolism (Fig. 7f) [26, 66]. Taken together, these results demonstrate rescue of muscle atrophy by restoring MEF2 activity and target gene expression in AR113Q mice.",

            "text": "We demonstrate a novel mechanism of skeletal muscle atrophy mediated by toxic proteins with expanded polyQ tracts, resulting in impaired function of the transcriptional regulator MEF2. The MEF2 family of transcription factors consists of four members, with Mef2a, Mef2c, and Mef2d most abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle (Table S4). Prior research demonstrates that MEF2A, -C, and -D bind the same consensus sequence [82]. Additionally, MEF2A, -C, and -D are capable of compensating for knockout of one but not all 3 Mef2 genes in satellite cells, suggesting redundant function of MEF2 family members in skeletal muscle [39]. Similar compensation of MEF2 family members has been demonstrated in the CNS, suggesting that functional redundancy is conserved between organ systems [41]. Mef2c expression is known to make important contributions to sarcomere integrity and maintenance [61]. Supporting this notion, MEF2 proteins regulate the expression of a large number of genes encoding structural proteins of the sarcomere [51, 78], and skeletal muscle-specific deletion of Mef2c leads to rapid deterioration of myofibers and disorganized sarcomeres [61]. Additional studies have demonstrated that postnatal growth is impaired by skeletal muscle-specific Mef2c deletion in mice [3]. Moreover, activation of MEF2 by silencing of the repressor Mrf4 or by overexpression of the constitutively active form, drives skeletal muscle hypertrophy in vivo, defining MEF2 as a key regulator of muscle hypertrophy [51]. In support of this role, knockout of another repressor of MEF2 activity, NCoR1, in mouse skeletal muscle also leads to MEF2 activation and skeletal muscle hypertrophy [81]. Additional studies have confirmed a role for MEF2 in cardiac [19] and smooth muscle hypertrophy [33], suggesting a conserved role between muscle types.

Evidence supporting this conclusion includes diminished activity of a MEF2-luciferase reporter in AR113Q muscle (Fig. 4a) and decreased expression of MEF2-regulated genes in AR113Q (Fig. 4b\u2013e) and R6/2 mice (Fig. 6a\u2013d) as well as in SBMA patients (Fig. 4f). Expression of CA-MEF2 rescues AR113Q muscle atrophy and target gene expression (Fig. 7b\u2013e), indicating the importance of these changes to disease pathogenesis and suggesting that targeting MEF2 function may be a novel and unexplored therapeutic avenue. Notably, impaired MEF2 activity occurs without concurrent alterations in the activity of the canonical UPS-mediated atrophy pathway (Fig. 1) [53], disruption of signaling pathways that influence muscle hypertrophy (Fig. 2), or significant impairment of the muscle stem cell niche (Fig. 3). As such, toxic polyglutamine proteins trigger muscle atrophy through a distinct and previously uncharacterized mechanism.",

            "text": "MEF2 activity is influenced by post-translational modifications, including acetylation and phosphorylation, which can enhance DNA binding and activity [40, 48, 85]. Several proteins have been identified as inhibiting MEF2 activity, either by direct binding or localization to MEF2-binding sites, including HDAC4 [16], Mrf4 [51], and NCoR1 [81]. Interestingly, MEF2 expression and nuclear translocation are not altered in AR113Q muscle, but its nuclear localization is disrupted by interaction with soluble polyQ AR and sequestration into insoluble inclusions, suggesting that co-aggregation is a final consequence of aberrant interaction with polyQ AR. Similar findings are observed in R6/2 muscle (Fig. 6), where the HDAC4-myogenin axis has been shown to be re-expressed [47]. This sequestration may reflect the fact that the MEF2C transactivating domain is intrinsically disordered and prone to aggregation (Supplementary Fig. 4G). These findings align with our observation that MEF2 impairment is mediated by polyQ AR proteotoxicity rather than loss of function (Fig. 5). Whether sequestration of MEF2 into morphologically visible inclusions is necessary for functional impairment is uncertain; it is possible that its aberrant association with soluble polyQ species in the nucleus may also disrupt activity and that sequestration into protein aggregates is the end stage of this process. Moreover, the extent to which sequestration of MEF2 into polyQ AR aggregates occurs in SBMA patient muscle remains to be determined; access to human tissue to perform this analysis was hampered by COVID-19 triggered laboratory shutdowns and, therefore, these experiments remain a future priority.",

While MEF2 is able to restore fiber size in atrophic muscle of adult SBMA mice, whether this effect is sustained during long-term treatment is not yet known. Furthermore, because MEF2 plays key roles in skeletal [51], cardiac [19], and smooth muscle [33] as well as in the nervous system [4, 24, 25, 44], therapeutically targeting MEF2 specifically in skeletal muscle remains a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose that in addition to direct modulation of MEF2, a strategy by which mutant AR is targeted to prevent aggregation and sequestration of MEF2, such as by administration of antisense oligonucleotides [38] or modulation of the HSP70/90 chaperone machinery [23, 79] may be synergistic as a long-term therapeutic.",

Our data suggest that a similar mechanism disrupts activity of MEF2, a critical regulator of sarcomere maintenance, to trigger skeletal muscle pathology. As MEF2 is also strongly implicated in activity-dependent neuronal survival [4, 24, 25, 44], we hypothesize that this mechanism of MEF2 sequestration and loss of function may additionally contribute to CNS pathology in polyQ diseases. It is intriguing to speculate that disease-specific disruptions of certain transcriptional regulators may contribute to cell-type vulnerability. In this regard, our observation of impaired MEF2 function in skeletal muscle provides both new mechanistic insight and identification of a therapeutic target for polyQ-mediated muscle atrophy.",
