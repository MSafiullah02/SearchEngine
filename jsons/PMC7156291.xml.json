As of February 17, 2020, confirmed cases of COVID-19 has been reported in 29 countries and territories; the majority of reported cases remain within China with 803 out of 71,356 cases outside of mainland China, initially in patients who have traveled to China and their close contacts [4].

Typical laboratory findings on admission include normal leucocytes in majority of patients and decreased lymphocytes in 35% of patients [2]. According to published reports, common CT findings consist of bilateral patchy ground glass opacities with peripheral predominance [5, 6]. As the disease progresses, consolidation becomes more common [6]. Acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS) develop in up to 30% of patients [1]. Intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions are uncommon findings [2, 5]. Chest radiographic (CXR) findings include bilateral patchy opacities [3, 7] though CXRs are considered unreliable in detecting early phase of the pneumonia [8]. Negative chest CTs have been reported in 14% of patients in one study [5]. Only a small number of cases with follow-up imaging have been reported thus far [6, 9]. Therefore, we evaluated serial CT pneumonia in patients with mild COVID-19 outside of Wuhan to elucidate the evolution of CT features with correlation to clinical findings.",

In our study cohort, the interval between symptom onset and first chest CT ranged from 1 to 15 days. Hence, familiarity with evolution of CT findings is useful to radiologists. Ground glass opacities are the most common CT findings within 0\u20133 days of symptom onsets as described in other published reports focused on initial presentations [11]. Over time, GGO remains a common finding and consolidation occurs with higher frequencies than in the early phase of disease, which means the disease is progressing rapidly. It is different from what happened with SARS [12]. Frequency of consolidation decreases 2 weeks after symptom onset. Reticulations and linear opacities, signs of interstitial involvement, and fibrosis become increasing prevalent later in the disease course. The total severity score shows a slight decrease in the third week. Cavitations were present in a small percentage of patients and likely present pre-existing conditions as none of the patients in the study cohort were observed to develop cavitation during the course of COVID-19. Lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions were absent on all the CTs analyzed, even on scans obtained 15\u201321 days after symptom onset. These findings are also similar to other reports [5]. Also similar to other published studies [13], we have observed a lower lobe predominance of pulmonary involvement. Bilateral involvement is found in the majority of patients though a significant number of patients do have unilateral involvement. Awareness of a significant minority of patients with only unilateral findings on CT at various time intervals is important so that radiologists do not exclude the possibility of COVID-19 simply because the findings were unilateral. Finally, in some patients, the CT findings can be minimal or even negative.",

Common imaging findings of influenza virus\u2013associated pneumonia include GGO, consolidation, and a combination of both. Pleural effusion, if present, is usually minimal, and lymphadenopathy is rare [14, 15]. Organizing pneumonia has also been reported [16]. There are recent publications that have suggested that CT findings of COVID-19 are similar to the organizing pneumonia (OP) pattern observed from post viral or atypical infections and other etiologies [17]. Despite a study discussing the nonspecific nature of COVID-19 pneumonia [18], a recent publication suggests that radiologists are able to differentiate COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia on CT [5, 6, 18, 19]. Laboratory testing for the novel coronavirus is time-consuming, and there are reports of shortage of test kits in some locations [20]. As we learned increasingly, initial laboratory tests for coronavirus can be falsely negative [20]. Therefore, the presence of suspicious CT findings in patients, correlated with a number of days after symptom onset, should prompt repeat laboratory testing and consideration of respiratory isolation in patients with appropriate travel and exposure history.",
