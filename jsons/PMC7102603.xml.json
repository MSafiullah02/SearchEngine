Owing to low capacity of current wastewater processing systems, the escalating amount of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment facilities has become a notable concern [2]. In the US, 79 million dry tons of liquid organic waste including sewage sludge was produced every year [2]. Furthermore, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicts a cost of 2% of global GDP (gross domestic product) to treat all of the human waste currently generated [3,4].",

First, denitrogenation process yields typically increase with temperature and reaction time in HTL. These conditions likely increase the opportunity for dissolution and hydrolysis of proteins and thus release more nitrogen. Second, nitrogen yield also varies markedly with changes in pH in the reaction medium, indicating that denitrogenation occurs readily under acidic or basic conditions during HTL [29]. Finally, more nitrogen can be removed by increasing the basicity of alkaline metals used to separate nitrogen from the mixture through ionic reaction pathways. Identification of these factors leads to a theory that denitrogenation happens via an ionic reaction path catalyzed by OH\u2212 ions in aqueous alkaline solutions [29].",

HTL biocrude oil converted from high-protein feedstocks typically has a nitrogen content of 3\u20137%, which is inappropriate for fuel application [8]. To date, denitrogenation of HTL biocrude oil has been investigated with hydrotreating [30,31], cracking [31,32], chemical extraction/separation from HTL biocrude oil [33,34], and supercritical fluid treatment [35, 36, 37]. However, the high nitrogen content of biocrude oil generated by HTL would result in fouling of conventional catalysts (e.g. zeolites) because of the high basicity caused by the nitrogen heterocyclic compounds [15,34,38]. Developing catalysts suitable for denitrogenation represents a knowledge gap in this area.",

Consolidation and concentration of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and other wastewater solids are also significant causes of concern. Antibiotics, for example, are particularly scrutinized as they increase the risk of antibiotic resistance through genetic mutation of bacterial strains present in wastewater treatment facilities. Antibiotics and their metabolites can enter sewage through feces, urine, or direct medication disposal and will enter the environment if not removed during sewage treatment. Removal of bioactive compounds (by tracking radiolabeled 14C) can be done by HTL [25], in which biocrude oil can be produced simultaneously.

In comparison, the largest flow rate documented in the literature was 60 L/h from Aarhus University (Denmark) [42]. The residence time was 20 min, which led to a reactor volume of 20 L.

            "text": "Summarizing from the available literature, it is generally agreed that possible peripheral bottlenecks to the scale-up (continuous- or pilot-scale) of HTL include (1) continuous feeding/pumping mechanism, (2) high-pressure pumping, (3) reactor corrosion caused by salts, (4) fouling/clogging of the continuous reactor, (5) product collection system, and (6) technology suitable for abating strong odors [6,22,40,42\u2217, 43, 44]. Detailed discussion of each possible bottleneck is described in the following list:(1)Continuous feeding/pumping mechanism: The continuous feeding mechanism is identified as one possible peripheral bottleneck because of two reasons. First, phase separation may occur in sewage sludge. This would be a serious issue especially in the winter, given that sewage sludge may contain high amounts of water. (Water would freeze in the winter, and thus, an external heating source is needed for the feeding tank.) Second, the viscosity of the sewage sludge could be very high and thus slow down its flow rate. Preferably, 20\u201325 wt.% of solid content is favored to achieve a net positive energy gain [7,44]. However, increasing the solid content may decrease the flowability of sewage sludge. The viscosity of the sewage sludge slurry dictates if the pumping system can be stably operated with a constant feedstock flow rate to the reactor. Possible solutions include the development of efficient pumping methods and pretreatments to reduce the viscosity of sewage sludge [40,45].(2)High-pressure pumping: Sewage sludge can be very viscous and may contain solid particles (e.g. gravel) and other compositions (e.g. plastic waste) that cannot be well homogenized before entering the upscaled HTL system. In this case, specialized high-end pumps such as a metering pump (i.e. a valveless rotary piston pump) are required to avoid possible blockage and undesired backflow (caused by flaky particles) in the sewage sludge feedstock [43].3)Corrosion caused by salts: Sewage sludge feedstock may contain corrosive contents. For instance, dechlorination and debromination would be necessary for treating chlorinated and brominated waste (e.g. sewage sludge may contain polyvinyl chloride or brominated flame retardants that may exist in electronics) [27,28].4)Fouling/clogging of the continuous reactor: Unwanted restriction of flow in continuous-flow reactors can result in serious clogging. In particular, the sewage sludge feedstock may contain highly volatile content (e.g. food waste), semivolatile content (e.g. paper or plastic), and nonvolatile content (e.g. metals and minerals) [22]. Because of a huge difference of their volatility (which indicates their convertibility under HTL), possible clogging may occur. How to mitigate or prevent the clogging when running a continuous pilot-scale HTL reactor is especially important because even a small clogging would build up the pressure and lead to safety problems. To resolve this issue, a recent study from Aarhus University (Denmark) has used a hydraulic oscillator to enhance the mixing of sewage sludge by increasing the turbulence in the reactor system [42].5)Product collection system: The products from HTL may be flowable at relatively high temperatures (e.g. >100 \u00b0C) but not at ambient conditions (i.e. 20\u201325 \u00b0C). Without a proper collection system, the HTL products may also lead to clogging of full-scale continuous-flow reactors. Furthermore, how to safely reduce the pressure from the reactor system to the product collection end is another issue. Last but not least, optimization of the heat exchanger represents an important aspect of the product collection system and a significant factor in the overall energy efficiency of a continuous HTL system [40].6)Technology suitable for abating strong odors: Sewage sludge typically contains certain amounts of proteins, which would be converted into odorous compounds such as nitrogen-containing (e.g. ammonia and pyridines) and sulfur-containing (e.g. H2S) compounds by HTL. Removal of these odorous compounds would be critical for a large-scale HTL operation to meet industrial hygiene and safety standards.\n",

Conventional incineration systems generally consume more energy than they produce because of the high moisture content in sewage sludge. Alternatively, anaerobic digestion (AD), an oxygen-free microbial fermentation of organics for biomethane generation, could be considered to cope with the increasing quantity of sewage sludge. AD is generally more effective than incineration for energy recovery. AD is also the most common method for sewage sludge stabilization, resulting in the reduction of volatile solids. However, AD usually suffers from poor conversion efficiencies (<50%), slow reaction rates (several weeks), and high capital costs.

Consequently, researchers have recently switched the feedstock from algae to sewage sludge, which are much cheaper than algae [58]. However, there is room to further study the potential of sewage sludge. For instance, as most wastewater treatment plants produce approximately equal amounts of primary and secondary sludge, testing of appropriate ratios of these feeds will help to shape planning of biocrude production plants. In addition, increasing the feed solid contents for continuous HTP will improve the economics through decreased capital costs and increased energy efficiency. Sensitivity analysis indicates significant economic benefits are available if the HTP aqueous product can be recycled back to the headworks of WWTFs. For example, about 30% cost is attributed to HTP aqueous product treatment (Figure 2). If combined improvements in the analyses are considered, cost of HTP fuel could be significantly reduced. Moreover, it should also be pointed out that by recycling the soluble organics into the HTP process, the main energy vector (i.e. biocrude oil) would be increased, instead of being distributed out of the system.",

            "text": "Before commercializing HTP, techno-economic analysis of the process along with energy calculations should be examined. Further research should be conducted with continuous-flow reactors using different types of sewage sludge and cosolvents. Particularly, increasing the sewage sludge concentration to around 20\u201325% without losing the flowability of the slurry for continuous HTL is critical in terms of process development to the industrial scale [40]. A higher solid content of sewage sludge (with a maximum content of 35% from a batch-scale study) typically can lead to a higher biocrude oil yield. As a result, the energy balance of continuous HTL systems would be improved because energy lost to a volume of water would decrease with a reduction in water content, and therefore, the production costs can be reduced [9]. One possible method to increase the sewage sludge concentration is pretreatment of sewage sludge. For instance, several pretreatment methods using acid hydrolysis, alkaline treatment, liquid hot water, ammonia, and steam explosion were applied to the slurries for enabling their pumpability for continuous HTL systems [40,45,60]. It was also found that an alkaline environment was preferable for preparing pumpable woody biomass for continuous HTL reactions [45,60]. Of course, further pretreatment also would further increase overall process costs.",

HTP, including HTC and HTL, is a promising method to sustainably manage sewage sludge because it can convert sewage sludge into useful products while mitigating the environmental risks of sewage sludge simultaneously. HTC has been extensively used for phosphorus recovery, while HTL can effectively remove CECs. Energy analysis of HTP indicated that HTP has a 11-fold higher energy recovery than landfilling. Further research on techno-economic analysis, environmental impact, and commercialization potential of HTP technology is recommended.",
