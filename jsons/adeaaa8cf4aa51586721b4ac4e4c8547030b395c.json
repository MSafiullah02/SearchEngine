Nurses who involved in first line treatment of patients with COVID-19 received education and training on use of PPE and personal emotion management in some hospitals [11] . Meanwhile, the daily working time was restricted to avoid PPE-associated complications, such as dehydration, as described by us and the other study [11] . However, as described in this study, due to shortage of nurses in this pandemic, the proportion of nurses who had no experience to work in PPE before this pandemic in frontline of treating COVID-19 was higher than expected. In addition, we also identified most of them did not work in department of respiratory or infective disease, implying they may have insufficient experience on fulminating infectious disease in their previous clinical practice. Although it is reasonable that training and education may benefit to reduce negative effects caused by goggles and have been emphasized in previous studies [11] , however, our findings showed short-term education and training on wearing PPE has limited effectiveness on easing mental stress and discomforts and cannot substantially avoid the occurrence of medical errors.

In addition, the proportions of headache and vomit were also significant lower in nurses with \u2265 21 years working experience.

Among the risk factors, the longer time before tolerating discomforts and headache meant the nurses' focus on practice would be interrupted and more frequent adjusting goggles can increase the chances of occurring medical errors. Because these three risk factors all associated with mental stress and design of goggles, modified goggles and psychological education should be seriously considered.",

In this study, the median time to arising fog in goggles was only 1 hour after wearing PPE, indicating nurses had to work with blurred vision for a long time. Alarmingly, our results revealed high proportion of nurses considered fog in goggles substantially impacted their work and associated with medical errors. Although we did not compare the incidence of exposures caused by fog in management of COVID-19 with the incidence in ordinary times, the exposure incidence of 10.4% cannot be neglected. Although several methods had been proven in clinical practice, especially smearing some types of reagents.",

Goggle-associated symptoms are highly prevalent in nurses involving in management of patients with COVID-19. These discomforts significantly impacted working status and potentially lead to medical errors. Headache, adjusting goggles and time before adapting goggles are three risk factors of medical errors. On the other hand, fog can obviously interfere the vision and lead to medical exposures. Improvement of design and materials of goggles during productive process is promising way to reduce the incidence of symptoms and fog and may benefit to working status and the occurrence of medical errors. In addition, longer training time and psychological education may help to reduce the mental stress through increasing the psychological quality and proficiency.",
