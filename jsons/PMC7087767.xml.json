HAdVs were detected by PCR analysis (HAdV screening assay) using primers targeting nucleotides (nt) 21\u2013322 of the hexon gene to amplify a 301 base pair (bp) fragment, as described elsewhere [18]. All PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and verified by sequence analysis. To verify the results of the HAdV screening assay, 50 samples that were positive according to the screening PCR assay were randomly selected and tested in a second PCR assay targeting the E1A gene and another fragment of the hexon gene. The PCR assays were performed as previously described [7]. Briefly, specimens identified as positive by the HAdV screening assay were subjected to a multiplex PCR assay for species B, C, and E, targeting nt 1042 to 1358, nt 354 to 844, and nt 707 to 929, respectively, of the E1A gene with predicted product sizes of 317 bp, 491 bp, and 222 bp, respectively. The positive samples of species B were subsequently verified using a multiplex PCR assay for serotypes HAdV-3, -7, and -21, targeting nt 796 to 1297, nt 500 to 810, and nt 547 to 783, respectively, of the hexon gene fragment, to produce amplicons of 502 bp, 311 bp, and 237 bp, respectively. The samples positive for HAdV-14, which belongs to species B, were further confirmed using primers that target nt 921 to 1245 of the Ad14 hexon gene to generate a 324-bp product.",

The study identified species B (HAdV-3, -7, -11, and -14), C (HAdV-1, -2, and -6), and E (HAdV-4) from respiratory samples of adults with ARTIs in Beijing. Our results show that human adenovirus B and HAdV-3 are the most frequently detected species and serotype, respectively. Although our findings may not completely reflect the infection of HAdVs circulating in China due to the limited number of HAdV-positive samples and geographical scale, they improve our understanding of the pathogenesis and disease burden of HAdVs in adults.",
