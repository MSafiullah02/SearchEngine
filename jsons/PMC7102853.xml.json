MERS is considered a life-threatening disease with an extensive health impact. The clinical manifestations vary from subclinical manifestations to rapid progressive acute pneumonia. MERS-CoV-infected patients often present fever, sore throat, myalgia, cough, and shortness of breath, and occasionally hemoptysis [1], [2], [3]. MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia [4]. Since its identification, MERS has been responsible for 2040 cases and 712 deaths in 27 countries worldwide by July 21, 2017 [5]. The majority of cases and deaths occurred in Saudi Arabia, most of which were sporadic infections, sometimes leading to family or hospital clusters [6].",

Initial investigations have indicated that MERS-CoV originated from bats; sequences related to MERS-CoV have been found in several bat species [6], [7]. Several other animal species in the Arabian Peninsula have been serologically assessed for MERS-CoV infection [8]. Viral and serological surveillance revealed a high rate of seropositivity to MERS-CoV in dromedary camels, including detection of antibodies to MERS-CoV in sera of camels in different countries (i.e., Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Egypt, Jordan, Nigeria, Tunisia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Canary islands, Pakistan, and Mali) [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Recovery of MERS-CoV genome sequences from camels with a high degree of homology to their counterparts in humans and isolation of MERS-like CoV from camels have been reported [9], [10], [14], [15], [19], [20], [21]. Together, these results suggest that the MERS-CoV detected in dromedary camels is the most likely source of the human infection [8], [9], [15], [20], [21]. The questions that need to be addressed are why the majority of human infections occur in Saudi Arabia, and whether interspecies transmission of the MERS-CoV to humans has only recently occurred or has only been recently recognized. The epidemiological factors related to these questions need to be investigated.",

The majority of cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, and most of them were reported in hospitals and healthcare units (nosocomial infection). The incidence of primary cases draws attention to a possible animal source, indicating a potential zoonotic infection. Several studies have reported a high prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camels [9], [11], [14]. Interestingly, antibodies to MERS-CoV have been detected in camel sera collected more than 10 years ago from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) [11]. In addition, MERS-CoV has been reported in camels in many cross-sectional and longitudinal studies [10], [19], [20], [21]. However, other farm animals (cattle, sheep, and goats) were negative for MERS-CoV antigen and antibodies [14], [15]. These results strongly suggest that the dromedary camels are the most likely source of the MERS-CoV infection; furthermore, these findings necessitate the investigation of MERS-CoV in animals related to MERS patients.",
