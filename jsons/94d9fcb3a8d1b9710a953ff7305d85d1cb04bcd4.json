All mAbs were purified 7 2 from cell culture supernatant using a HiTrap protein G HP affinity column (GE 7 3 Healthcare) and stored at -80 \u00b0C. The purity of the mAb was confirmed by sodium 7 4 dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE) analysis. The 7 5 concentration of the purified mAb was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein 7 6 assay reagent (Thermo Scientific). 7 7 Transient transfection and western blot analysis 7 8 COS-7 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates 24 hours prior to the transient transfection 7 9 using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's 8 0 protocol. SARS-CoV-2 S-expressing plasmids were codon-optimized and generated by 8 1 gene synthesis (Bio Basic Asia Pacific) according to GenBank accession QHD43416.1. 8 2 One plasmid is for expressing full-length S while the other is for expressing a fragment 8 3 consisting of residues 1048-1206. At 48 hours post-transfection, cells were harvested, 8 4 spun down by centrifugation and washed with cold PBS twice. Cells were then 8 5 resuspended in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 0.5% 8 6 deoxycholic acid, 0.005% SDS and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] and subjected 8 7 to five freeze-thaw cycles. Clarified supernatant containing the protein of interest was 8 8 obtained by spinning down the cell lysate at 13,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C to remove the cell debris and further analyzed by Western blot (WB) analysis. 20 \u03bc g of total cell lysates were 9 0 resolved using electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose 9 1 membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered 9 2 saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated with 9 3 primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C overnight. After the membrane was washed with TBST, it was 9 4 incubated with a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific) at room 9 5 temperature for 1 hour. The membrane was then washed with TBST again and detected 9 6 with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Scientific). 9 7 Transient transfection and immunofluorescence analysis 9 8 For immunofluorescence (IF) analysis, COS-7 cells on glass coverslips were transfected 9 9 as above and fixed at 24 hours post-transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at iPC objective lens and Olympus DP27 colour camera with Olympus cellSens software. Each channel was collected separately, with images at 1024 x 1024 pixels. Virus infection and IF 1 1 0 All works with live virus has been performed in the BSL3 facility at the Public Health were fixed with chilled methanol/acetone and the cells were kept in -20\u00b0C overnight. Cells were then stained using mAb 1A9 at 5\u00b5g/ml at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes in Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Thermo Fisher) containing DAPI in Bioinformatics analysis 1 2 2 Spike glycoprotein reference protein sequences for SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HKU1 were downloaded from NCBI (GenBank accessions in alignment in Figure 1A) . A 1 2 5 multiple sequence alignment was created with MAFFT using the slow but accurate L- INS-I parameter settings [21] and the alignment curated, cut to the target region 1029- 1192 (SARS-CoV numbering) and visualized with Jalview [22] . We used Mega X [23] to 1 2 8 calculate the number of amino acid differences for all sequence pairs in the alignment of the mAb target region ( Figure 1B ) and the full S protein ( Figure 1C ) normalized by the To determine within-outbreak sequence diversity in the spike glycoprotein, 230 human nucleotide sequences were searched with BLASTX against the reference spike mutations were counted and tabulated using a custom Perl script (Supplementary Table 2 ). 1 4 3 CoV-2 but not in endemic coronaviruses 1 4 4 By using five different fragments of SARS-CoV S to immunize rabbits, a fragment 1 4 5 corresponding to residues 1029 to 1192 was found to stimulate neutralizing antibodies 1 4 6 against SARS-CoV [24] . Interestingly, sequence alignment shows that this domain, 1 4 7 which encompasses the heptad repeat (HR) 2 but not HR1, is highly conserved in SARS- 1 4 8 CoV-2 ( Figure 1A ). When compared with additional reference sequences from bat Immunofluorescence analysis using the indicated primary antibodies followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Scale bar = 50\u00b5m. ",
