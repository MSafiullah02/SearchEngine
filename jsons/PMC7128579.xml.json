            "text": "Bioaerosols are very small airborne particles (ranging from 0.001 to 100 \u03bcm) that originate biologically from plants/animals and can contain living organisms (Georgakopoulos et al., 2009). Therefore, pathogenic and/or non-pathogenic dead or alive microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, and fungi) may exist in bioaerosols (Mandal and Brandl, 2011). Bioaerosols are easily shifted from one environment to another because of their small size and light weight (Van Leuken et al., 2016). In recent years, exposure to bioaerosols in both occupational and residential environments has drawn much attention in light of their probable impacts on human health.",

            "text": "Sources of bioaerosol exposure in occupational activities are diverse enough to include waste sorting and composting, agricultural and food processing activities, the livestock industry, etc. (Pearson et al., 2015). Indeed, the prevalence of diverse respiratory diseases or symptoms (allergic asthma, rhinitis, airway inflammation, etc.) has been reported from workers susceptible to such exposure (Beck et al., 2012, Rohr et al., 2015). Bioaerosols were estimated to be responsible for approximately 5 to 34% of indoor particulate matter air pollution (Mandal and Brandl, 2011). The sources of indoor bioaerosol pollution include outdoor sources (passing through windows, doors, and ventilation); building materials; furnishings; occupants; pets; house plants; and organic wastes (Nazaroff, 2016). Regular or ordinary human activities (e.g., coughing, washing, toilet flushing, talking, walking, sneezing, and sweeping floors) are also capable of generating bioaerosols (Chen and Hildemann, 2009). However, basic environmental conditions, such as temperature and moisture content, can considerably influence the extent of their formation and dispersion due to their controlling effect on the formation of microorganisms (Dedesko et al., 2015). Consequently, the prevalence of bioaerosols can be associated with certain human diseases, such as pneumonia, influenza, measles, asthma, allergies, and gastrointestinal illness (Srikanth et al., 2008). However, under certain circumstances, exposure to some microbes is beneficial for health in terms of developing a healthy immune system and protect children from developing allergies and asthma (Severson et al., 2010). Although the importance of bioaerosols and their impact on human health has been recognized, it is yet difficult to accurately describe their role in the initiation or worsening of diverse symptoms and diseases. Table 1\npresents the types of microorganisms and their resulting diseases. In this review, we give a comprehensive overview on bioaerosols based on the most recent publications covering this subject, with major emphasis on their compositions, and health effects. As a result, we hope that this review work will help researchers extend and establish better knowledge in relevant fields.",

            "text": "It is reasonable to expect that the presence of each type of bioaerosol should reflect unique environmental conditions facilitating its formation and the mechanical stresses. The selection of sampling tool for airborne bioaerosol should thus be more delicate than those commonly employed for the general analysis of particle composition. However, as the sampling methods are not yet well defined for such specific purposes, the methods developed for general purposes can be applied for the sampling of bioaerosol with or without modifications: (i) impingers, (ii) cyclones, (iii) impactors, (iv) filters, (v) spore traps, (vi) electrostatic precipitation, (vii) thermal precipitators, (viii) condensation traps, (ix) gravitational samplers (e.g. settle plates), etc. (Haig et al., 2016). Instrumental setups of some of these samplers are shown in Fig. 1\n. Usually these sampling devices separate particles from the air stream for their stable collection in or on a preselected medium (Jensen and Schafer, 1998). Gravitational sampling is passive (non-volumetric) to facilitate the collection of particles by gravitional force on coated microscope slide, agar plates, etc. (Wang et al., 2001). For inertial bioaerosol samplers, a number of options are available to include impactors, sieves, and stacked sieves. These setups allow the collection of particles by size selective sampling as they rely on the properties of particle to deviate from airflow streamlines due to inertia (Haig et al., 2016). Non-inertial samplers (e.g., filtration, electrostatic precipitation, thermal precipitators, and condensation traps) do not rely on inertia of particles for operation; thus, they are less reliant on particle size (Ghosh et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Airborne particles are collected into a liquid collection medium in impingers and/or cyclones method. Impingers are operated by channeling air flow through nozzles to the collection chamber containing liquid. Hence, a number of factors (e.g., the air flow rate and distance between nozzle outlet and the surface of the liquid) influence the size diameter of the particles to be collected (Han and Mainelis, 2012). In a cyclone sampler, air is forced into the collection chamber through a spiraling, swirling flow. To escalate the sampling efficiency, a film of liquid can be added through the inlet of the cyclone as a cyclone wall under wet conditions. The liquid can then be collected for analysis at the bottom of the cyclone (McFarland et al., 2010. The air flow reverses its direction upon reaching the base of the cyclone. Then, the uncollected particles are carried out of the cyclone via a vortex finder placed in the top of the cyclone (McFarland et al., 2010). The bioefficiency can also be reduced through evaporation or as particles adhere internally on the walls of the collection chamber (Hoisington et al., 2014). In a new cyclone sampling technique, the samples are collected in standard centrifuge tubes from the top of the sample chamber unlike a conventional cyclone (e.g., collection from side) (Macher et al., 2008). Such bioaerosol samples can be processed immediately in these tubes. Hence, there is no need to transfer samples from the collection vessel to a new tube, making the processing much easier and simpler (Macher et al., 2008). Cyclone samplers with the multiple tubes are also efficient enough for collecting size-fractionated samples: large bioaerosol (initial (centrifuge) tube), medium-sized particles (second tube), and the smallest ones (filter)) (Macher et al., 2008).",

They can impact the agar plate while being influenced by the centrifugal force (Xu et al., 2013). This feature makes an impactor sampler highly suitable to classify all different particles into diverse size fractions.

Fibrous filters are made of a mat of fine fibers arranged in such a way that particles are captured on the fibers when they pass through the filter. Furthermore, such filters have complex pore-like structure where the particles are deposited (Uhrbrand et al., 2011). However, the efficiency of the filter sampling should be affected by the combined effects of several variables like microbial species, type of membrane filter, relative humidity, and sampling time (Wang et al., 2001). For detecting airborne bioaerosols, one should rely on many forms of cultivation media such as malt extract agar (MEA) (Lehtinen et al., 2013), Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Park et al., 2011), dichloran rose-bengal chloramphenicol (DRBC) (Tolvanen and H\u00e4nninen, 2006), and yeast extract glucose chloramphenicol (YGC) (Borrego et al., 2012). In one of the previous studies, Thorne et al. (1992) concluded that the all-glass impinger method was the best method for collecting total bacteria and fungi while the microbial sampler method was used preferably for sampling enteric organisms.

Significant relationships have been found between meteorological parameters (especially, relative humidity) and bacterial and fungal growth (Niazi et al., 2015). The outdoor concentrations of fungal and bacterial bio-aerosols were found to increase during monsoons (Kang et al., 2015).

In a wastewater treatment unit in Tehran, Iran, the average concentrations of bacterial bioaerosols in winter and summer were measured as 1016 and 1973 colony-forming unit (CFU)FND/m3, respectively (Thorne et al., 1992). The concentrations of fungi and bacteria measured from the bedroom of six contemporary, airtight dwellings in the USA during winter ranged from 3 to 59 (mean 18.4) and 19\u2013607 (mean 212) CFU/m3, respectively (McGill et al., 2015). The findings of relatively low concentration levels from those samples also suggest that the filtration of air through the mechanical ventilation heat recovery (MVHR) system should have limited the migration of outdoor fungi and bacteria. Bacterial bioaerosol concentrations were generally low (from 0 to 118 (mean 11) CFU/m3) in the winter. Such result was found as the bacteria have adapted at the typical body temperatures of 30\u201340\u00b0C (Smirnova et al., 2001). In the Seoul Metropolitan area, S. Korea, the fungal bioaerosols were in the range of 24 to 654 (mean 177) CFU/m3 during winter (Lee et al., 2016). In contrast, their values in summer increased moderately to vary from 60 to 930 (mean 357) CFU/m3 (Heo et al., 2014).",

Likewise, the concentrations of bacteria measured in areas without occupants were considerably lower than those with occupants (p\n < 0.05) (Adams et al., 2015). As such, the number of occupants and their activity were likely to sensitively affect the concentration levels (and compositions) of indoor bacteria.

Human exposure to endotoxins occurs constantly, as they can easily bind to dust (i.e., easily inhalable) (Wallace et al., 2016). Response to endotoxins varies due to such factors as dose, location, and route. Exposure to endotoxins was suggested to a cause decrease in lung diffusion capacity along with diverse symptoms and diseases, such as fever, shivering, blood leukocytosis, neutrophilic airway inflammation, arthralgia, dyspnea and chest tightness, and bronchial obstruction (Thilsing et al., 2015).",

However, different types of mycotoxins may be produced by one mold species, while the same mycotoxin may be produced by several species (Andretta et al., 2011). Hence, classification of mycotoxins can be made based on their chemical structures as well as reactive functional groups (e.g., primary/secondary amines, carboxylic acids, hydroxyl (or phenolic) groups, lactams, and amides) (Grenier and Applegate, 2013). The health effects of mycotoxins on humans and animals are diverse enough to include weakened immune systems, allergies or irritations, many identifiable diseases, and even death. The effects of mycotoxicosis should depend on the type of mycotoxins, the duration of exposure, concentration levels, and the conditions of the exposed individual (e.g., age, health, and sex) (Marin et al., 2013). Moreover, the severity of such poisoning, if taking place, can be compounded by many variables (e.g., alcohol abuse, vitamin deficiency, caloric deprivation, and infectious disease status) (Marin et al., 2013). Exposure to mycotoxins occurs most often via ingestion, inhalation of spore-borne toxins, as and dermal contact on mold-infested substrates.",

However, the risk of asthma and other allergic diseases can increase, if exposed to allergen to a certain degree (Baxi and Phipatanakul, 2010). Allergens can be found in a variety of sources, such as fungi (spores and hyphae), arthropods (mites and cockroaches), vascular plants (fern spores, pollen, and soy dust), pet dander, and royal jelly (Jutel et al., 2016). Many factors (e.g., mechanical disturbance, wind, rain, or active discharge mechanisms) exert the control on the release of particles into the air. Indoor humidity and water damaged items (e.g., carpets, ceilings, and walls) are important sources of mite and mold allergens (Peden and Reed, 2010).",

Zoonotic infections (e.g., Q-fever, brucellosis, anthrax, and avian and swine influenza) are predominantly attributed to livestock farms, veterinary practices, abattoir, and animal store workers (Wu et al., 2015). Among 44 seroepidemiological studies, 37 (84%) were identified to be subject to an enhanced risk of zoonotic pathogen infection (Baker and Gray, 2009). Infected veterinarians may act as biological sentinels to spread zoonotic pathogens to the surroundings (e.g., community members, their families, and the animals they care). For instance, the Chlamydophila psittaci bacteria are highly prevalent in psittacine birds and pigeons (Vanrompay et al., 2007, Ling et al., 2015). People are mostly infected through inhalation and/or being exposed to petting infected birds, C. psittaci-infected aerosols, and handling infected avian tissues (West, 2011). In the Netherlands, a three-year (2007\u20132009) cumulative epidemic of Q fever took place due to the airway transmission of the causative micro-organism Coxiella burnetii via infected dairy goat farms (Commandeur et al., 2014). Due to this outbreak, more than 4000 patients were reported to visit Municipal Health Services (MHS) over that period (Roest et al., 2011). The epidemic ended through taking the control measures on dairy goat and sheep such as hygiene measures, vaccinations, and the culling of pregnant infected animals (Dijkstra et al., 2012).",

Johnson and Choi (2012) reviewed lung cancer risk of workers in the meat/poultry industry. They concluded that even after controlling for smoking there was about 30% excess risk of lung cancer among them. Furthermore, meat and poultry plant workers were suspected to be exposed to high concentrations of airborne mixture including fecal material, dander (skin material), feather, and micro-organisms (e.g., virus, endotoxins, fungi, and bacteria). The dose\u2013response relation, when assessed by lung cancer among meat workers, indicated the potent role of the exposure to biological materials in the form of animal urine, feces, and blood (possibly oncogenic zoonotic viruses) (McLean et al., 2004). From a pilot case-cohort study (30,411 poultry workers under the high risk of exposure vs. 16,408 control subjects), pancreatic/liver cancers were found to be caused from the slaughtering of poultry (OR = 8.9, 95% CI: 2.7\u201329.3)/OR = 9.1, 95% CI: 1.9\u201342.9); the catching of live chickens (OR = 3.6, 95% CI: 1.2\u201310.9)/OR = 1.0, 95% CI: 0.1\u20138.5); and the killing of other types of animals for food (OR = 4.8, 95% CI: 1.5\u201316.6)/OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 0.2\u201318.2) (Felini et al., 2011).

However, the apparent concentrations of airborne bioaerosol are greatly dependent on the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, and airflow) along with the variables associated with analytic approaches employed by the investigator. It is also necessary to accurately analyze all microbial cells suspended in the air and to differentiate those which are metabolically active, culturable, and non-viable.",

Exposure guidelines thus should not be established until a standard methodology is available. Without scientifically proven standards and guidelines, arbitrary criteria may lead to inappropriate testing and test interpretations (WHO, 2009). Moreover, the consequences of misleading sampling data can be significant in terms of litigation, labor grievances, disability claims, inappropriate medical treatment, or recommendation to demolish public buildings. Therefore, further validation and standardization are needed for establishing procedures for quantification of bioaerosol (e.g., sampling, extraction, and analytical procedures) (Ghosh et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Furthermore, there are a few latest technologies (e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Metagenomics) are currently used for microbial analysis. PCR is a technique used in microbial community analysis for synthesizing multiple copies (amplifying) of a specific piece of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This technique is very rapid (results usually available within 12 to 26 hr), high degree of sensitivity (able to detect one colony forming unit in a 25 g sample), precise and accurate, flexible (assays for more than one pathogen can be run simultaneously) (DeAngelis et al., 2011). ELISA is also an analytical technique that uses components of the immune system (such as IgG or IgM antibodies) and chemicals to detect the presence of an antigen or antibody in a given sample (Verma et al., 2013). The variations in ELISA allow us to detect either antigen or antibody, identifying the different strains of microbes at a time, and also in characterization of the epitope distribution on the microbial surface (Verma et al., 2013).It shows wider applications in clinical diagnosis, in pathological studies, and in quality control studies. Metagenomics applies direct genetic analysis tools to access the genetic content of entire communities of organisms (Cha et al., 2017). Metagenomics gives genetic information on potentially novel biocatalysts or enzymes, genomic linkages between function and phylogeny for uncultured organisms, and evolutionary profiles of community function and structure (Thomas et al., 2012). The metagenomics approach can also serve as a powerful tool for elucidating the relationship between host-associated microbial communities and host phenotype (Banerjee et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The presence of bioaerosols has been suspected as the cause of various human diseases covering not only infectious/respiratory symptoms but also cancer. Bioaerosols are also found in most enclosed environments owing to their ubiquitous presence in nature. Even higher bioaerosol concentrations may be observed in indoors (compared to outdoors) due to various internal sources that are generally associated with human activities. Hence, increasing the mechanical or natural ventilation rate and regular cleaning and maintenance activities can play a vital role in increasing indoor air quality. However, even under ideal conditions for preventative maintenance, chances of exposure to bioaerosols persist. In light of the fact that many uncertainties still remain in exposure assessment (i.e., poorly developed tools for quantitation of risks), efforts to resolve such issues should be developed in many respects. There are various types and non-ideal microbiological techniques available for sampling and analysis of bioaerosols (and the extent of their exposures) that have left much confusion and many misconceptions. Until new and reliable techniques are introduced, a common protocol for their quantitation based on currently available methods is to be employed to offer a near-uniform basis to allow cross-comparison between different experimental data sets. Therefore, more research is desirable to properly establish better assessment tools for the exposure to bioaerosols and its validation.",
