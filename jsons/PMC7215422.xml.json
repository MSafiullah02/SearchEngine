Inadequate use of antibiotics not only is an economic burden for the sanitary systems\u2014especially for developing countries\u2014but also it increases the risk of adverse events and, more importantly, the emergence of resistant bacteria [2]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), antibiotics overuse is one of the biggest threats to human health nowadays [3]. The development of a fast and accurate diagnostic testing to early distinguish viral from bacterial infections in clinical settings and hospitals would facilitate a reduction in the overuse of wide-spectrum antibiotics, helping physicians make the right decisions and fight the appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",

Firstly, obtaining results from cultures usually takes 48\u201372 h, a timeframe that might be inadequate for decision-making in terms of antibiotic prescriptions to children with suspected infection. Secondly, bacterial cultures have limited sensitivity, to the extent that, e.g., failure to detect causal microorganisms occurs in 50% of pneumonia patients in critical care units [4,5]. According to Rozon et al. [6], the sensitivity and specificity of a Gram stain from a good-quality sample in the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia and H. influenzae ranged 57\u201382%. Besides, samples obtained from accessible sites (e.g., blood) can be useless for pathogen detection in cases where the infection is located in inaccessible anatomical sites. Third, viruses are usually detected in healthy children, and also in children with bacterial infections. For instance, in a large international collaborative study, Martin\u00f3n-Torres et al. [7] recently reported that pathogen detection has been of limited help to distinguish viral from bacterial infection.",

[8] showed that RNA from blood leukocytes of children with life-threatening viral or bacterial infections bears host-pathogen specific transcriptional signatures. This finding represented a shift of paradigm in the study of infectious diseases since, for the first time, the host, and not the pathogen, became the focus of attention. Since then, RNA analysis has arisen as a powerful screening tool to find diagnostic biomarkers that may be used to develop new tests that overcome the limitations of bacterial culture. Recently, several studies have been exploring host-specific transcriptomic biomarkers that may allow distinguishing between viral and bacterial infections or pathogen-specific signatures [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. Related to transcriptional signatures, there are also several studies relating host genetic susceptibility factors to infectious diseases [17,18,19,20,21].",

The only exception occurs in the Mexican group (Figure 1B) where the boxplot shows some overlap in the first and third quartiles (75th percentile) of the boxplots for virus-infected patients versus controls.

            "text": "According to the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE; [25]) pilot project, most of the human genome (74\u201393%) transcribes in multiple RNAs, and the vast majority of them does not display protein coding capacity [26,27]. New sequence technologies (e.g., RNA-seq) have recently led to the discovery of many previously unknown no protein-coding lncRNAs. Even though these RNAs are encoded by an important proportion of the genome, most of their functions are still unknown [28]. This is because, unlike mRNAs or proteins, presently the function of lncRNAs cannot be predicted by looking at the sequence or structure. Their function is most likely related to chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation, and post-transcriptional regulation [29]. It is currently widely accepted that lncRNAs are involved in biological and pathological processes such as X dosage compensation in mammals, regulation of the immune response, gene imprinting, regulation of the cell cycle, telomere length, etc. [28,30]. The strongest evidence to support the role of host lncRNAs in the regulation of innate and adaptative immune system has come from animal models of infection and/or disease [30]. Thus, Peng et al. [31] observed that coronavirus infection in lung tissue altered globally the lncRNAs levels in several mouse strains. A few years later, experiments by Gomez et al. [32] carried out in transgenic mice infected with Salmonella and Theiler\u2019s virus found that the upregulation of the lncRNA NeST increased the clearance of Salmonella infection, but also reduced resistance to the mouse Theiler\u2019s picornavirus. According to their results, NeST induces interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), a cytokine that is critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral, some bacterial and protozoal infections expression in T cells. Almost simultaneously, Zhang et al. [33] reported that the knockdown of the lncRNA NEAT1 enhances HIV-1 virus production. A year later, Imamura et al. [34] found that the NEAT1 promoted IL8 expression in response to viral infection in human cells. Nevertheless, it has been reported that a major problem in the study of lncRNA in animal models is the lack of evolutionary conservation of the lncRNAs between species, which constitutes a major barrier in extrapolating results from animal models to humans [30].",
