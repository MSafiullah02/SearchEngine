We aimed to investigate the prevalence of RV genotypes, sensitization status, and clinical characteristics of patients having a respiratory infection caused by either different RV species or other respiratory viruses. The study enrolled 111 patients (aged 3-23 months, 79% hospitalized, 76% with RV infection) with the first wheezing episode. RV-specific sequences were identified by partial sequencing of VP4/VP2 and 5 0 non-coding regions with 80% success rate. The investigated clinical and laboratory variables included atopic characteristics and illness severity, parental atopic illnesses, and parental smoking. Of the study children, 56% percent had >1 atopic characteristic (atopy, eczema and/or blood eosinophil count >0.4 \u00c2 10 9 /L) and 23% were sensitised to allergens. RV-C was detected in 58% of RV positive samples, followed by RV-A (20%) and RV-B (1.2%). Children with RV-A and RV-C induced wheezing were older (P \u00bc 0.014) and had more atopic characteristics (P \u00bc 0.001) than those with non-RV. RV-A and RV-C illnesses had shorter duration of preadmission symptoms and required more bronchodilator use at the ward than non-RV illnesses (both P < 0.05, respectively). RV-C is the most common cause of severe early wheezing. Atopic and illness severity features are associated with children having RV-A or RV-C induced first wheezing episode rather than with children having a non-RV induced wheezing.",

A total of 33 RV isolates (52%) genotyped by 5 0 NCR assay were not amplified with primers targeting VP4/VP2 region. RV-C was the most common species detected in 73% (46/63) of the samples using 5 0 NCR specific primers. RV-A isolates were detected in 25% (16/63) and RV-B in 1.6% (1/63) of the samples, respectively. In order to confirm 5 0 NCR based sequencing results and to verify RV-C species and type assignments, the sequencing of partial VP4/VP2 was also performed. Of those 34 RV positive samples, 88% (30/34) represented RV-C, 8.8% (3/34) RV-A, and 2.9% (1/34) RV-B. Most of the type assignments (93%) were congruent between the sequences obtained from both 5 0 NCR and VP4/VP2 region (n \u00bc 30). Two sequences matching RV-A101 type inVP4/VP2 region and RV-C23 or RV-C16 types in 5 0 NCR suggest either putative recombination or presence of two different RV types in the same sample. Of the 34 isolates genotyped from the VP4/VP2 region, sequencing of 5 0 NCR products was unsuccessful from four samples. Altogether, 58% (49/84) of the genotyped clinical isolates were indentified as RV-C, 20% (17/84) as RV-A, and 1.2% (1/84) as RV-B while 20% (17/84) remained non-typeable.

In a few samples the PCR product was not specific for RV (false-positive samples). Notably, viral genome copy number was low in most of the non-typeable samples so this might affect the results of repeated PCR amplification (data not shown). It has been shown that sequencing primers targeting VP4/VP2 region are less sensitive than the 5 0 NCR primers used in the primary diagnostic PCR [Wisdom et al., 2009; Simmonds et al., 2010; Bochkov et al., 2014] . Moreover, the sequencing may have been unsuccessful due to presence of multiple RV strains in the same sample. A low number of viral genomes in the samples may represent an antecedent infection. However, the rate of non-typeable RVs is in agreement with previous studies, in which their prevalence has varied from <2% to 30% when using partial sequencing of 5 0 NCR and VP4/VP2 region [Linder et al., 2013; Bochkov et al., 2014; Principi et al., 2015; M\u20ac uller et al., 2015] .

            "text": "We showed RV co-infections with other respiratory viruses in 40% of the first-time wheezing children which is in line with earlier reports (10-50%) [Bizzintino et al., 2011; Cox et al., 2013; Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2016] . In contrast to previous studies showing more co-infections in RV-A cases [Miller et al., 2009a; Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2016] , we found more of them in RV-C cases, which is in agreement with the study of Bizzintino et al. [2011] . The exact mechanism of higher rates of co-infection associated with RV-A versus RV-C species is currently unknown. Perhaps different viral pathogenesis, for example, lower interferon responses and increased epithelial permeability, in RV-C versus RV-A infection might predispose to co-infections with other viruses and bacteria [ Jakiela et al., 2008; Baraldo et al., 2012; Contoli et al., 2015] . Besides, the overall prevalence of RV-C isolates in our study samples could also affect the results of co-infection analysis. Our finding also strengthens the role of respiratory viruses, especially RV, in wheezing illnesses [Jartti et al., 2004; Jackson et al., 2008] . RV is shown to be a strong predictor for recurrent wheezing episodes, and together with allergic sensitization the risk for developing asthma is further increased [Jackson et al., 2008; Jackson et al., 2012; Lukkarinen et al., 2013] . Earlier publications have shown that children with RV-A or RV-C infection had increased risk for wheezing when being sensitised to dust mite, and that atopic sensitisation might increase the risk for hospitalization in children with RV-C induced lower airway illnesses [Soto-Quiros et al., 2012; Cox et al., 2013] . Our study adds to previous reports that atopy is especially common in young children with first wheezing episode caused by RV-A or RV-C rather than by other respiratory virus infection [Soto-Quiros et al., 2012; Cox et al., 2013; Lukkarinen et al., 2013; Turunen et al., 2014] . Furthermore, our finding may indicate that children who are sensitized to many environmental factors are more prone to be infected by RV-A or RV-C than by other respiratory viruses. Our results also add to previous findings, that blood eosinophilia is associated especially with RV-A or RV-C induced early wheezing [Midulla et al., 2010] . Maternal atopy has been associated with RV induced lower airway illnesses in young children; yet, no association with specific RV species has been found either in a one previous study or in our study . However, in a subgroup analysis, hospitalized children with RV-A and RV-C infection were associated with parental and maternal asthma when compared to those with non-RV infection. An earlier study has shown that RV induced wheezing in children is associated with male sex [Turunen et al., 2014] . This finding is supported by our subgroup analysis of hospitalized patients when children with RV-A and RV-C infections were more associated with male sex than those with non-RV infections. This might also indicate that boys are having a more severe illness than girls. Earlier studies have found RV-A and RV-C to cause more clinically severe lower airway illnesses than RV-B species and in general RV to cause more aggressive illness than RSV [Arden et al., 2010; Bizzintino et al., 2011; Cox et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2015; Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2016] . This adds to the previous findings that rapid onset of RV illness is essentially prevailing in children with RV-A and RV-C induced wheezing . The association with the use of bronchodilator in our study also supports the more severe illness in RV-A and RV-C infected children than in non-RV. On the contrary, our findings are in agreement with three recent studies reported that there is no significant difference in the illness severity between only RV-A and RV-C infected children [M\u20ac uller et al., 2015; Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2016] . Furthermore, neither in our study nor in one previous study did co-infection status influence the illness severity; however, the sample size was small in our study [Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2016] . Severe wheezing in association with RV-A and RV-C infections might be explained by impaired antiviral responses and reduced epithelial barrier function [Jakiela et al., 2008; Baraldo et al., 2012; Contoli et al., 2015] . RV has shown to be a strong risk factor for recurrent wheezing regardless of whether being detected alone or with other viruses [Jackson et al., 2008; Hasegawa et al., 2014; Bergroth et al., 2016] . However, the role of RV coinfections causing recurrent wheezing needs further studies.",

For RV typing, we used specific primers from both partial 5 0 NCR and VP4/VP2 region of the viral genome. Typing of VP4/VP2 is known to be more definitive for RV species and type differentiation. However, it is generally known that 5 0 NCR primers are more sensitive for RV PCR amplification than primers targeting VP4/VP2 region [Wisdom et al., 2009; Simmonds et al., 2010; Bochkov et al., 2014] . In our study, the genotyping results from the VP4/VP2 region were similar in 93% of samples when compared to those from the 5 0 NCR; however, sequences from both regions were obtained only in 30 samples. RV-C was 3 (0, 4) 2 (0, 5) 2 (0, 3) 0.58 Severe cough 0 (0, 1) 0 (0, 1) 0 (0, 1) 0.85 Duration of wheezing after discharge for 2 weeks, days Wheezing 2 (1, 6) 2 (0, 5) 2 (0, 4) 0.58 Moderate wheezing 1 (0, 2) 0 (0, 1) 0 (0, 1) 0.22 Severe wheezing 0 (0, 0) 0 (0, 0) 0 (0, 0) 0.53 RV, rhinovirus.

Data were analysed using Pearson's chi-square test, Fischer exact test, one-way ANOVA or Kruskall-Wallis test. Pairwise comparisons for skewed data were done using Mann-Whitney U-tests with Bonferroni corrections. For duration of wheezing before recruitment: P \u00bc 0.78 between RV-A and non-RV, P \u00bc 0.028 between RV-C versus non-RV, and P \u00bc 1.0 between RV-A and RV-C.

Understanding the connection between atopic status and wheezing induced by RV species is clinically important when evaluating subsequent risk of asthma.",
