            "text": "The causes of acute lung injury are numerous (Box 6.1\n). The lung reacts to various types of insults in similar ways, regardless of etiology. The resultant endothelial and alveolar epithelial cell injury is attended by fluid and cellular exudation. Subsequent reparative fibroblastic proliferation is accompanied by type II pneumocyte hyperplasia.4, 10 The microscopic appearance depends on the time interval between insult and biopsy and on the severity and extent of the injury.2 DAD is the usual pathologic manifestation of ARDS and is the best-characterized prototype of acute lung injury. From studies of ARDS, the pathologic changes appear to proceed consistently through discrete but overlapping phases (Fig. 6.1\n)\u2014an early exudative (acute) phase (Fig. 6.2A and B\n), a subacute proliferative (organizing) phase (Fig. 6.2C), and a late fibrotic phase (Fig. 6.3\n).2, 4, 5, 9, 11 The exudative phase is most prominent in the first week of injury. The earliest changes include interstitial and intraalveolar edema with variable amounts of hemorrhage and fibrin deposition (Fig. 6.4\n). Hyaline membranes (Fig. 6.5\n), the histologic hallmark of the exudative phase of ARDS, are most prominent at 3 to 7 days after injury (eSlide 6.1). Minimal interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates (Fig. 6.6\n) and fibrin thrombi in small pulmonary arteries (Fig. 6.7\n) also are seen. Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia (Fig. 6.8\n) begins by the end of this phase and persists through the proliferative phase. The reactive type II pneumocytes may demonstrate marked nuclear atypia, with numerous mitotic figures (Fig. 6.9\n). The proliferative phase begins at 1 week after the injury and is characterized by fibroblastic proliferation, seen mainly within the interstitium but also focally in the alveolar spaces (Fig. 6.10\n). The fibrosis consists of loose aggregates of fibroblasts admixed with scattered inflammatory cells, reminiscent of organizing pneumonia (Fig. 6.11\n); collagen deposition is minimal. Reactive type II pneumocytes persist. Immature squamous metaplasia may occur (Fig. 6.12\n) in and around terminal bronchioles. The degree of cytologic atypia in this squamous epithelium can be so severe as to mimic malignancy (Fig. 6.13\n). The hyaline membranes are mostly resorbed by the late proliferative stage, but a few remnants may be observed along alveolar septa. Some cases of DAD resolve completely, with few residual morphologic effects, but in other cases, fibrosis may progress to extensive structural remodeling and honeycomb lung. As might be expected, a review of outcomes for 109 survivors of ARDS revealed persistent functional disability at 1 year after discharge from intensive care.12\nBox 6.1Etiology of Diffuse Alveolar Damage\nIdiopathicAcute interstitial pneumonia (Hamman-Rich syndrome)InfectionAny infection in the immunosuppressed patient, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci infectionViral infection: adenovirus, influenzavirus, herpesvirus, CMV, and hantavirus infections; severe acute respiratory syndrome; coronavirus and RSV infections, others\nLegionella infection\nMycoplasma/Chlamydia infectionRickettsial infectionDrugsChemotherapeutic drugs: busulfan, bleomycin, methotrexate, azathioprine, BCNU, cytoxan, melphalan, mitomycin-CAmiodaroneGoldNitrofurantoinHexamethoniumPlacidylPenicillamineConnective tissue diseaseSystemic lupus erythematosusRheumatoid arthritisPolymyositis/dermatomyositisSclerodermaMixed connective diseasePulmonary hemorrhage syndrome and vasculitisGoodpasture syndromeMicroscopic polyangiitisPolyarteritis nodosaGranulomatosis with polyangiitisVasculitis associated with collagen vascular diseaseIngestantsParaquatKeroseneDenatured rapeseed oilInhalantsOxygenAmitrole-containing herbicideAmmonia and bleach mixtureChlorine gasHydrogen sulfideMercury vaporNitric acid fumesNitrogen dioxidePaint removerSmokeSmoke bombSulfur dioxideWar gasesShockTraumaticHemorrhageNeurogenicCardiogenicSepsisRadiation exposure, including via radiation-impregnated embolization beadsOther etiologic factors/conditionsAcute massive aspirationAcute pancreatitisBurnCardiopulmonary bypassHeatHigh altitudeIntravenous administration of contrast materialLeukemic cell lysisMolar pregnancyNear-drowningPeritoneal-venous shuntPostlymphangiographyToxic shock syndromeTransfusion therapyUremiaVenous air embolism\n\nBCNU, Carmustine; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome.Alt-text: Box 6.1Modified from Katzenstein A, Askin F, eds.

The foregoing description is based on a model of ARDS due to oxygen toxicity, wherein the evolution of histopathologic abnormalities can be studied over a defined time period.2, 5 In practice, lung biopsy most often is performed in patients without a known cause or specific time of onset of injury. Moreover, with some causes of acute lung injury, the damage evolves over a protracted period of time, or the lung may be injured in repetitive fashion (e.g., with drug toxicity). In such circumstances, the pathologic changes do not necessarily progress sequentially through defined stages as in ARDS, so both acute and organizing phases may be encountered in the same biopsy specimen.

Organizing pneumonia in the form of luminal loose fibroblastic tissue is present surrounding the fibrin (eSlide 6.2).

For example, the presence of acute lung injury with associated atypical type II pneumocytes with markedly enlarged pleomorphic nuclei89 and prominent nucleoli (see Fig. 6.29) is characteristic for busulfan-induced pulmonary toxicity, and, on ultrastructural examination, intranuclear tubular structures have been found in type II pneumocytes in association with administration of busulfan and bleomycin.89, 90, 91, 92 In most cases, the possibility that a drug is the cause of DAD can only be inferred from the clinical history. Considerations in the differential diagnosis typically include other treatment-related injury or complication of therapy (e.g., concomitant irradiation or infection). For example, oxygen therapy is a well-recognized cause of DAD (Fig. 6.30\n) and also may exacerbate bleomycin-induced lung injury.93 Methotrexate (Fig. 6.31\n) is another commonly used cytotoxic drug that can cause acute and organizing DAD.94 Methotrexate also produces other distinctive patterns, such as granulomatous interstitial pneumonia (see Chapter 8) that is seldom seen in association with other commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. To complicate matters further, methotrexate also is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, a disease known to produce DAD independently as one of its pulmonary manifestations.57, 62\n",

Intraalveolar fibroblastic proliferation (patchy organizing pneumonia) and inflammatory cells are present to a variable degree. Hyaline membranes and organizing intraalveolar fibrin also may be present (Fig. 6.35\n). The most significant feature is the presence of interstitial and alveolar eosinophils. Infiltration of small blood vessels by eosinophils also may be seen. It is important to distinguish acute eosinophilic pneumonia from other causes of DAD because patients typically benefit from systemic corticosteroid treatment, with prompt recovery. However, before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, infection should be rigorously excluded by culture and special stains because parasitic and fungal infections also can manifest as tissue eosinophilia. Treatment with steroids prior to the biopsy can make the number of eosinophils less impressive.",

In 1958 Pratt first noted pulmonary changes due to high concentrations of inspired oxygen.128 In 1967 Nash et al. described the sequential histopathologic changes of this injury,126 later reemphasized by Pratt.127 In neonates receiving oxygen for hyaline membrane disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia was reported to occur.129 As might be expected, the features of hyaline membrane disease in neonates and oxygen-induced DAD in adults are indistinguishable (see Fig. 6.30).

In the typical presentation, dyspnea of rapid onset is accompanied by development of diffuse chest infiltrates several hours to days after an episode of shock. After ARDS begins, the mortality rate is high.1, 2, 130\n",

            "text": "The histologic spectrum encountered in acute lung injury is broad. Very early cases may look nearly normal with only mild interstitial and alveolar edema. Other more advanced cases are clearly abnormal with fibrin, inflammation, and organization. The basic elements of the acute injury pattern include interstitial edema, alveolar edema, fibrin, hyaline membranes, reactive pneumocytes, and organization (see Box 6.2). Acute lung injury is a pathologic pattern and by itself is a nonspecific finding. From a practical perspective, after an acute lung injury pattern is identified, careful search for the following additional features often help to narrow the list of possible causes (summarized in Table 6.1\n).\nPresence of hyaline membranes. The most commonly encountered potential etiologic disorders include infection, connective tissue disease, drug toxicity, and an idiopathic form of diffuse alveolar damage (i.e., acute interstitial pneumonia).2, 5\n\nPresence of neutrophils. The presence of neutrophils in lung alveolar spaces should always raise the possibility of infection.121, 134 For example, legionnaires' disease characteristically is associated with acute bronchopneumonia with DAD.51\n\nPresence of frothy exudates. The presence of frothy exudates in alveolar spaces is a classic feature of pneumocystis pneumonia. However, this feature is not always present. In some cases, especially in mildly immunocompromised patients, DAD may be the only finding.46\n\nPresence of necrosis. Among the infectious causes of DAD, viral infection figures prominently. Influenzavirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and adenovirus infections are well known to produce DAD,29, 31, 34, 35, 36 and all of these viral infections typically are accompanied by necrosis. Legionella and Pneumocystis infections also can produce acute lung injury with necrosis.44, 46, 51\n\nPresence of eosinophils. Acute and organizing DAD with prominent interstitial and alveolar eosinophils is characteristic of acute eosinophilic pneumonia.104 However, if the patient has been treated with steroid before biopsy, very few eosinophils may remain, and the diagnosis may be difficult or impossible.\nPresence of siderophages and capillaritis. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages with or without capillaritis in the setting of acute lung injury should raise consideration of immunologically mediated pulmonary hemorrhage.112 Care must be taken not to interpret the pigmented macrophages seen in the lungs of cigarette smokers as evidence of hemorrhage.135 The hemosiderin in macrophages related to true hemorrhage in the lung (from any cause) is globular, often slightly refractile, and golden-brown in color.57, 112, 113, 114\n\nPresence of atypical cells. Viral infections often produce cytopathic effects, including intracellular inclusions (see Chapter 7). Examples of intracellular inclusions are the Cowdry A and B inclusions seen in herpesvirus infection, cytomegaly with intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions of cytomegalovirus, the multinucleated giant cells of measles virus and respiratory syncytial virus, and the smudged cells of adenovirus infection.33, 37, 38, 136, 137 Chemotherapeutic drugs such as busulfan and bleomycin often are associated with markedly atypical type II pneumocytes, which may have enlarged pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli.90, 91 Markedly atypical type II pneumocytes that may be suggestive of a viropathic effect also are seen in radiation pneumonitis.79, 124, 125\n\nPresence of foamy cells. Alveolar lining cells with vacuolated cytoplasm accompanied by intraalveolar foamy macrophages are characteristic features seen in patients taking amiodarone, and amiodarone toxicity may lead to acute lung injury changes.97, 98, 99, 101 In some cases of radiation pneumonitis, foam cells are seen in the intima and media of blood vessels.79, 125\n\nPresence of foreign material. Foreign material in the spaces in the form of vegetable matter or other food elements is indicative of aspiration. Massive aspiration events may cause DAD. Other foreign material, such as radiation impregnated beads may also be encountered.\nPresence of advanced interstitial fibrosis. Clinical IPF is associated with the changes of UIP on pathologic examination (see Chapter 8), with advanced lung remodeling. Of interest, IPF undergoes episodic exacerbation, and on occasion such exacerbation may be overwhelming, with resultant DAD.138 It is prudent to examine lung biopsy sections for the presence of dense fibrosis with structural remodeling (microscopic honeycombing) in cases of DAD, to identify the rare case of IPF that manifests for the first time as an acute episode of exacerbation.\n",

Next, the results of any sampling procedures to identify infection should be checked, along with application of special stains to the tissue sections, to exclude infection. Finally, data regarding related disease, such as infection, autoimmune disease, underlying lung disease, are needed. For example, if the patient is immunosuppressed, infection should always be the leading consideration in the differential diagnosis. Another point to keep in mind is that patients with certain diseases may be taking medications with the potential to cause DAD (e.g., amiodarone for cardiac arrhythmia). Moreover, laboratory studies may reveal antibodies related to connective tissue disease (e.g., antineutrophil antibody, rheumatoid factor, Jo-1, Scl-70, antifibrillarin, anti-Mpp10, SS-A, SS-B).",
