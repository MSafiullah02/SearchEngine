The risk of aspiration pneumonia is higher in the elderly and patients with dysphagia, stroke, or critical illness and lower in patients without teeth. Usually, the episode of aspiration is not witnessed; the diagnosis is inferred when patients at risk for aspiration present with an infiltrate in a characteristic pulmonary location (posterior upper lobe or apical lower lobe segments from recumbent aspiration, and basal lower lobe segments from upright or semi\u2010recumbent aspiration). Patients with aspiration pneumonia have clinical features similar to those of patients with CAP but have a higher incidence of pulmonary cavitation and abscess formation.",

However, you may be involved in the decision\u2010making process during a rotation through the emergency department or if you see a patient with CAP in clinic. Recognized risk factors for increased mortality in CAP include advanced age and co\u2010morbidities, such as cancer and heart failure. The decision to admit relies on clinical judgment, although there are also prognostic scoring rules that can support this decision. The most widely used and rigorously studied prediction rule is the Pneumonia PORT (Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team) Severity Index (PSI), which stratifies patients into one of five categories using a point system based on several variables at the time of presentation (Fig. 13\u20101\n). An easy\u2010to\u2010use version is available on the internet at http://ncemi.org. The higher the score, the higher the 30\u2010day mortality rates, the longer the length of stay, the higher the risk of admission to the intensive care unit, and the higher the risk of readmission to the hospital. The risk for death ranges from 0.1% to 2.8% for classes I to III, 8.2% to 9.3% for class IV, and 27% to 31% for class V. Therefore, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends home care for risk classes I to III only. Patients with low PORT scores may fail outpatient treatment because of preexisting conditions, such as social or psychiatric problems, inability to take oral medication, or acute hypoxemia. Therefore, an assessment for factors that may compromise successful outpatient therapy for CAP should occur prior to calculation of the PORT score. In other words, prediction rules might oversimplify the interpretation of important variables. Therefore, these scoring systems should not take the place of clinical judgment.",
