All systems include both a touch screen control tablet and a motion sensor that double as jointers to connect the emitters together for transport. The system utilizes a laser to identify the size of the disinfection space and to identify near-field objects. Based on these measurements the system then calculates the disinfection cycle time accordingly while rotating 360\u00b0.",

The moist environment created by the bleach soaked pads in the biosafety cabinet prevented drying of the virus onto glass coverslips. MERS-CoV was therefore loaded onto glass coverslips as small droplets at a concentration of 8.9e5 pfu/mL in UV-C permeable dishes and exposed to UV-C energy from the Surfacide emitter placed 4 feet (1.22 m) from the dishes. Samples were removed at several time points between 0 and 30 minutes. Virus resuspension and dilution were carried out as described above. Virus dilutions were placed onto 90% confluent African green monkey kidney cell-line (Vero81) cells at 37\u00b0C for 40 minutes. Following a 40-minute incubation, medium containing virus was removed and replaced with 2\u00d7medium plus 1.2% agarose and allowed to solidify. DMEM was then layered on top to prevent drying, and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 days to allow plaque formation. On day 3, formalin was added to fix the cells for 20 minutes. Formalin, media, and agarose were then removed and replaced with 0.1% crystal violet for a 5-minute incubation. This procedure was followed by a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) wash prior to counting plaques. Again, all samples were prepared in triplicate.",

Applying those same studies to droplets of MERS-CoV resulted in undetectable levels of MERS-CoV virus after only 5 minutes of exposure to the UV-C emitter or a percent reduction of >99.999%. Notably, UV-C disinfection is most effective when used as an adjunct to standard terminal cleaning of hard surfaces and should not be used to replace good cleaning practices.\n8\n This study is the first to document the effectiveness of a multiple-emitter, automated, whole-room UV-C system or any whole-room disinfection system against RNA viruses like MHV-A59, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV. The use of the Surfacide whole-room UV-C disinfection system during MERS outbreaks may prevent the nosocomial spread of the virus and protect staff in the process.",
