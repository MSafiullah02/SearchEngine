Techniques such as specialized flow cytometry [1] , dynamic light scattering [2] , quantitative capillary electrophoresis [3] , and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy [4] can determine the number of particles in a sample within hours. The choice of technique depends on the sort of virus and the matrix in which it is suspended. All aforementioned techniques differentiate particles on the basis of physical properties such as size or antibody affinity. As a consequence particle analysis cannot differentiate infectious from noninfectious virus particles.",

            "text": "There is only one technique available that can reliably quantify the number of infectious particles in a sample. This technique, developed many decades ago [5] , exploits the fact that virus can propagate in biological systems such as embryonated eggs or cell cultures. Propagation of a virus is generally accompanied by changes in cell morphology (referred to as cytopathic effect or CPE), which can be visualized using a microscope, or even by eye. Some viruses do not induce CPE, in which case an antibody based assay (immunofluorescence or ELISA) is needed to determine presence or absence of virus. During a titration assay, tissue cultures or embryonated eggs are incubated with tenfold serial dilutions of a virus containing sample and several days later the cytopathic effect is scored. From these scores, the virus titer is calculated using the methods described by Spearman and Kaerber [6, 7] or Reed and Muench [8] . The virus titer is defined as the reciprocal of the dilution at which 50 % of the inoculated embryos or tissue cultures show CPE. In this chapter we use the method of Spearman and Kaerber to calculate the titer, as this calculation can cope with unequal group sizes. Unequal group sizes frequently arise when eggs are lost to aspecific death of the embryo or bacterial infection.",

Replication of most field isolates of infectious bronchitis coronavirus is restricted to embryonated eggs or tracheal organ culture. Most isolates, however, can be adapted to propagation in primary chicken kidney (CK) cells. Adaptation typically requires several passages and selects for viral subpopulations and can induce mutations [9] . Passaging of IBV in either embryonated eggs or primary cell cultures leads to attenuation of the virus in vivo [10] [11] [12] . The most striking example is the IBV Beaudette strain, which has been passaged hundreds of times in eggs and primary chicken kidney cells [13, 14] . Although IBV Beaudette propagates very well on eggs, CK cells and even in Vero cells, the virus is highly attenuated in vivo and vaccination using Beaudette provides little protection against infection with pathogenic strains of IBV [15] .",
