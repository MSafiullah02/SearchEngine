Physical examination revealed cervical lymphadenopathy and tonsillar hypertrophy, with purulent exudate, and no fever. The patient was started on an empiric antibiotic course with macrolides. Two weeks after the first assessment, she reported the onset of mild non-radiating chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and reduced exercise tolerance, without symptoms at rest. Thus, she underwent a cardiological evaluation: physical examination was unremarkable, blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm of 90 bpm, normal atrioventricular tract, no repolarization abnormalities. An echocardiogram showed reduced ejection fraction (40\u201345%) with global hypokinesia and no regional wall motion abnormalities, mild pericardial effusion along the right chambers without signs of tamponade. The patient was then referred for immediate hospitalization.",

Clinical manifestations of myocarditis range from subclinical disease to sudden death, due to fulminant heart failure and/or malignant ventricular arrhythmias; cardiac symptoms include fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, decreased exercise tolerance, or syncope. A viral prodrome including rash, myo-arthralgias, gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms could anticipate the onset of myocarditis by several days to a few weeks [3].",
