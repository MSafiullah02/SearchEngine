Most current MERS-CoV serological assays such as neutralization, immunofluorescence, or protein microarray rely on handling of live MERS-CoV in high containment laboratories, highly trained personnel as well as the need for expensive and special equipment and reagents representing a hurdle for most laboratories especially when resources are limited. In this chapter, we describe a validated and optimized indirect ELISA protocol based on recombinant S1 subunit (amino acids 1-725) of MERS-CoV for qualitative and quantitative determination of MERS-CoVbinding antibodies.",
