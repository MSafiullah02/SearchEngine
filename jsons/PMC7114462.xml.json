            "text": "For productive entry into host cells, viruses attach to specific cell surface receptor molecules (Casasnovas, 2013, Marsh and Helenius, 2006). Selection of an entry receptor is governed by precise interactions that mediate efficient virus attachment to the cell surface as well as productive cell infection. Viruses can use a large number of cell surface molecules to penetrate host cells (Backovic and Rey, 2012); these molecules are the main determinants of virus tropism and pathogenesis. Receptor-binding motifs in viruses are subject to changes promoted by immune surveillance, which can target key receptor-binding residues during neutralization of virus infection. It is thus relatively common that a virus evolves to use distinct cell entry receptors over the course of an infection, or that related viruses use different cell surface molecules for host cell entry (Stehle and Casasnovas, 2009). This is the case of coronavirus (CoV), whose use of distinct entry receptor molecules is responsible for their broad host range and tissue tropism (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001, Masters, 2006). Some CoV have remarkable capacity for cross-species transmission which is linked to virus adaptation to the use of orthologous receptor molecules (Graham and Baric, 2010, Holmes, 2005).",

            "text": "The CoV are a large family of enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses involved in respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neuronal infectious diseases in animals and in man. The CoV are subdivided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma and delta (de Groot et al., 2011, de Groot et al., 2013). Prototype viruses in each genus are transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV, alpha1-CoV), human coronavirus (hCoV-229E and hCoV-NL63, alpha-CoV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, beta-CoV, lineage A), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV, beta-CoV, lineage B), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, beta-CoV, lineage C), avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, gamma-CoV) and bulbul coronavirus (delta-CoV). The CoV have a major envelope glycoprotein, the spike (S), which is responsible for CoV cell entry and interspecies transmission (Perlman and Netland, 2009). This glycoprotein mediates CoV particle attachment to cell surface molecules, as well as the fusion of virus and cell membranes (Masters, 2006). The S protein assembles into trimers, displayed as peplomers in the CoV envelope (Beniac et al., 2006); the protein has a membrane-distal N-terminal S1 portion and a stalk formed by the S2 region. The S1 region contains the receptor-binding determinants, whereas S2 mediates virus-cell fusion for membrane penetration (Fig. 1\n).",

            "text": "Like the class I fusion proteins, the S2 region adopts a helical structure, and is followed by the transmembrane domain (Bosch et al., 2003). S2 contains the fusion peptide and two conserved heptad repeat regions, HR1 (N-terminal) and HR2 (C-terminal) (Fig. 1), which form a coiled coil structure important for S trimerization and the fusion reaction during CoV cell entry (Supekar et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004). The fusion peptide is N-terminal from the HR1 in the S2 sequence (Fig. 1), but the HR1\u2013HR2 coiled coil structure places it close to the transmembrane region. As in other enveloped viruses, the initiation of the fusion reaction requires partial disassembly of the trimeric spikes and the exposure of the fusion peptide for binding to the host cell membrane (Belouzard et al., 2012, Beniac et al., 2007, Harrison, 2005). In some MHV variants and in the SARS-CoV, the S protein is processed into S1 and S2 fragments by cell proteases, which facilitate the fusion process and cell entry (Belouzard et al., 2012, Glowacka et al., 2011, Huang et al., 2006). The S of alpha-CoV is not processed. Receptor-mediated endocytosis and exposure to low pH is a necessary step for entry of TGEV, hCoV-229E and SARS-CoV (Masters, 2006). Other CoV, such as MHV and hCoV-NL63, do not require a low pH step for fusion, and the entry processes is mediated by receptor binding on the cell surface (Huang et al., 2006, Sturman et al., 1990). CoV can thus follow different entry pathways to penetrate host cells (Belouzard et al., 2012); receptor, low pH and proteases are three major inducers of membrane fusion, and CoV use them differentially for cell entry. Mutations in the S1 and S2 fragments indicate that differences among CoV entry routes are probably related to variations in S trimer stability (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). Nonetheless, the conformational changes in the CoV S that lead to membrane fusion and cell entry have not been defined.",

Receptor-binding domains (RBD) can be located at the N- and/or C-terminal moieties of the S1 region (Li, 2012, Peng et al., 2011) (Fig. 1). The S glycoprotein N-terminal domain (NTD) can function as a RBD (N-RBD); it can be the only S1 domain engaged in receptor recognition or, in conjunction with C-terminal RBD, can broaden tissue tropism of certain CoV. As entry receptors, the N-RBD can recognize sialic acids in some cases (Fig. 1) (Peng et al., 2011), whereas it binds to carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecules (CEACAM) in MHV (Williams et al., 1991). The NTD in TGEV is responsible for its enteric tropism, absent in the related porcine respiratory CoV (PRCV) that lacks this domain (Sanchez et al., 1992). The NTD region adopts a galectin-like structure in two beta-CoV, and its fold might be conserved in alpha- and gamma-CoV, since glycan-binding activity has been reported for the three genera (Li, 2012, Schultze et al., 1996).",

            "text": "In most CoV, the major determinants of cell tropism are found in the C-terminal portion of the S1 region (Masters, 2006). These RBD can usually fold independently of the rest of the S, and can be expressed as a single domain with all receptor-binding determinants (Du et al., 2013, Reguera et al., 2011, Wong et al., 2004, Wu et al., 2009). Sequence and structure of the RBD vary considerably among CoV, and they recognize distinct entry receptors (Fig. 1). Several CoV of the genus alpha, including TGEV and hCoV-229E, use aminopeptidase N (APN) for cell entry (Delmas et al., 1992, Yeager et al., 1992), whereas hCoV-NL63 binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Wu et al., 2009). In the beta-CoV, the SARS- and the MERS-CoV use ACE2 and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) receptors, respectively (Li et al., 2003, Raj et al., 2013). APN, ACE2 and DPP4 are membrane-bound ectoenzymes with multiple functions such as angiogenesis, cell adhesion and blood pressure regulation (Boonacker and Van Noorden, 2003, Crackower et al., 2002, Mina-Osorio, 2008). The three proteins catalyze peptide-bond hydrolysis of short peptides. The reason for CoV use of ectoenzymes as entry receptors is unclear; it might be linked to their abundance on epithelial cells rather than on their peptidase function, which does not appear to be essential for CoV cell entry (Li et al., 2005c). Virus-binding regions in these ectoenzymes are distant from the catalytic site (Li et al., 2005a, Lu et al., 2013, Peng et al., 2011, Reguera et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2013, Wu et al., 2009).",

They show a single domain unit that has a \u03b2-barrel fold with two highly twisted \u03b2-sheets (Fig. 2\n). In one \u03b2-sheet, three \u03b2-strands (\u03b21, \u03b23 and \u03b27) run parallel (Fig. 2A). The three RBD have three disulphide bonds. In the crystal structure of the TGEV RBD, solved at high resolution, the bent \u03b2-strand 5 (\u03b25) crosses both \u03b2-sheets (Fig. 2A). N-linked glycans cluster at one side of the \u03b2-barrel; the opposite side is not glycosylated and might be closer to other S protein domains. N- and C-terminal ends of the RBD are located on the same side of the domain (terminal side); at the opposite side, two \u03b2-turns form the tip of the barrel in the TGEV RBD (Fig. 2A). This region of the \u03b2-barrel domain contacts the receptor (see below) and its conformation in the APN-binding RBD of TGEV and PRCV differs from the ACE2-binding region in the hCoV-NL63 domain (Fig. 2B and C). These differences probably determine the distinct receptor-binding specificities of alpha-CoV. The TGEV or PRCV RBD tips are formed by two protruding \u03b2-turns (\u03b21\u2013\u03b22 and \u03b23\u2013\u03b24), each bearing a solvent-exposed aromatic residue (tyrosine or tryptophan) (Fig. 2A and B). In contrast, the hCoV-NL63 RBD tip has a slightly recessed conformation, with the aromatic residues at the center of the receptor-binding surface (Fig. 2C).",

Each APN monomer has an RBD bound in the crystal structure of the PRCV RBD\u2013APN complex (Fig. 3A). The bidentate, protruding tip contacts the APN, and the exposed side chains of the tyrosine and tryptophan residues penetrate small cavities of the APN ectodomain. The tyrosine side chain fits between an \u03b1-helix and a carbohydrate N-linked to the APN, whereas the bulky tryptophan is in a narrow cavity formed at the DII\u2013DIV junction (Fig. 3A). In addition to the tyrosine, other RBD residues contact the first N-acetyl glucosamine (NAG) linked to the porcine APN Asn736, and fix the glycan conformation. The CoV tyrosine and tryptophan residues are critical for TGEV RBD binding to APN (Reguera et al., 2012), and preliminary results indicated that they are essential for virus entry and infection (unpublished data). CoV recognition of APN is species-specific, and specificity is associated to the APN N-linked glycan that interact with the RBD \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 turn in the structure (Reguera et al., 2012, Tusell et al., 2007). Porcine, feline and canine alpha-CoV with a tyrosine at the \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 turn recognize APN proteins bearing the glycan. The large degree of sequence conservation in the RBD tip of alpha1-CoV also suggests a highly conserved APN recognition mode (Reguera et al., 2012). hCoV-229E does not have a tyrosine in its RBD \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 turn, however, and it recognizes the human APN that lacks this glycosylation (Reguera et al., 2012, Tusell et al., 2007). The conformation of this alpha-CoV RBD tip differs from that of alpha1-CoV, suggesting that hCoV-229E recognition of APN must be unique. It is nonetheless likely that this human alpha-CoV preserves a protruding tip for binding to small APN cavities. hCoV-NL63 RBD interacts with the ACE2 ectodomain opposite to the way that the alpha-CoV bind to APN. The hCoV-NL63 RBD has a blunt tip that contacts protruding regions of the receptor (Fig. 3B). In the middle of the interacting surface, the depressed center of the RBD tip contacts a unique receptor \u03b2-turn (\u03b24\u2013\u03b25), which interacts with a tyrosine and a tryptophan in the virus protein (Fig. 3B). The rims of the RBD tip bind to two \u03b1-helices of the ACE2 receptor. Specificity is determined by several hydrogen bonds that engage amino and carbonyl groups in the main chains of the interacting molecules (Fig. 3B).",

Crystal structures demonstrate that the conformation of the receptor-binding region in the alpha-CoV S must be the principal determinant of its receptor recognition specificity. We recently demonstrated that the RBD tip is a principal antigenic determinant (site A) in the S of TGEV and related alpha-CoV (Reguera et al., 2012). Potent neutralizing Ab of porcine CoV cluster at site A (Delmas et al., 1990, Sune et al., 1990). These Ab recognize the RBD tip and bind to the tyrosine or the tryptophan essential for APN binding (Reguera et al., 2012). These data suggest that the conformation of the alpha-CoV receptor-binding region evolved under pressure from the immune system, particularly in humans, leading to small variations in the way hCoV-229E recognizes the APN protein (Tusell et al., 2007) or to radical changes that modified receptor specificity in hCoV-NL63.",

Before SARS, MHV was the most studied beta-CoV in vitro and in vivo, especially in laboratory mouse. MHV strains cause specific inflammations in several mouse organs, such as the neurotropic strains JHM and A59 responsible for acute encephalitis and chronic demyelination in survivors, which serve as a model for the study of multiple sclerosis (Weiss and Leibowitz, 2011).

BatCoV-HKU4 recognizes the human DPP4 protein, indicating possible direct transmission from bats to humans (Wang et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2014). Recent evidence nonetheless shows involvement of dromedary camels as intermediates in virus transmission from bats to man (Doremalen et al., 2014, Haagmans et al., 2014). Human-to-human transmission is not frequent, probably because of low DPP4 expression in the human lower respiratory tract (Raj et al., 2014).",

It has three small \u03b1-helices (A\u2013C) and three disulphide bridges. A second subdomain of \u223c65 residues inserts between two central \u03b2-strands of the core (\u03b24 and \u03b27), and is distal to the terminal side of the domain (Fig. 4A, dark-red). This inserted subdomain lies on one side of the core and comprises a central two-stranded \u03b2-sheet connected by a long loop region; one side of this loop and the \u03b2-sheet clamp the core. The \u03b2-sheet, the extensive interactions with the core, and a disulphide bond in the most solvent-exposed region of the subdomain stabilize its structure (Fig. 4A). One crystal structure of the isolated SARS-CoV RBD shows that it can form dimers through the terminal side (Hwang et al., 2006). The dimerization surface in these crystals is relatively large (\u223c1000 \u00c52 buried surface area, BSA/monomer) and the authors proposed that RBD dimers could crosslink S glycoprotein trimers. It is nonetheless unclear whether such oligomers are found on the virus envelope and could recognize ACE2.",

The interaction buries 25 residues and about 860 \u00c52 of the virus protein, and a similar surface (820 \u00c52) of the ACE2 receptor. The ACE2-interactive surface of the SARS-CoV RBD is \u223c100 \u00c52 larger that of hCoV-NL63, consistent with marked differences in kinetic dissociation rate constants, which is an order of magnitude lower in SARS than in hCoV-NL63 (Li et al., 2005c, Wu et al., 2009). Both viruses recognize overlapping ACE2 regions, including the N-terminal \u03b1-helix (\u03b11) and the \u03b2-turn formed by \u03b24 and \u03b25 strands (Fig. 3, Fig. 4).

The interaction includes at least 10 virus\u2013receptor hydrophilic bonds, some of which engage the hydroxyl groups of RBD tyrosines that also mediate non-polar interactions with the receptor (Fig. 4C). There is an important virus\u2013receptor hydrogen bond interaction between the ACE2 Lys353 carbonyl and the main chain amino group of RBD Gly488 (Fig. 4C) (Li et al., 2005a). The lysine side chain amino interacts with RBD main chain carbonyl. This ACE2 lysine is absent in mouse and rat ACE2 proteins, which are not recognized by the SARS-CoV. ACE2 glycosylation is also a determinant of SARS-CoV species specificity (Li et al., 2005c). A glycan linked to rat ACE2 Asn82 prevents its use as an efficient virus receptor. Deletion of the glycan and the His353/Lys substitution convert rat ACE2 into a SARS-CoV receptor, showing that efficient ACE2 recognition is central to virus infection and host-to-host transmission (Holmes, 2005, Li et al., 2005a, Li et al., 2005c).",

            "text": "SARS-CoV emerged from bat CoV and was transmitted through palm civet CoV; cross-species transmission is linked to RBD changes that increased its affinity for human ACE2 (Holmes, 2005, Li, 2013, Li et al., 2005a, Li et al., 2005c). Of the residues involved in SARS-CoV RBD binding to ACE2, only a few have a key role in SARS-CoV adaptation to man (Fig. 4C). Lys479/Asn and Ser487/Thr mutations are two key changes in the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein for infection of human cells. Substitutions in one of these residues increases SARS-CoV RBD binding affinity to human ACE2 by 20- to 30-fold, whereas the double mutation has a synergistic effect, with a 1000-fold increase in affinity (Li et al., 2005c). The Asn at position 479 is found in some civet CoV; it does not affect binding to civet ACE2, but increases SARS-CoV RBD affinity for the human protein (Li et al., 2005c). Asn479 contacts the human ACE2 His34 and is relatively close to Lys31 in the N-terminal \u03b1-helix (Fig. 4C), which are Tyr34 and Thr31 in civet ACE2. The presence of a positively charged lysine rather than Asn in RBD position 479 does not complement the human ACE2 Lys31 and His34 residues. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV RBD in complex with human ACE2 demonstrates that the methyl group of the threonine at position 487 establishes specific contacts with the ACE2 Tyr41 and Lys535 side chains, increasing affinity for the human protein (Fig. 4C) (Li et al., 2005a). The SARS-CoV that caused sporadic outbreaks in 2003\u20132004 has serine at position 487 and shows very poor human-to-human transmission. This phenotype was also associated with the Leu472/Pro substitution in the ACE2 contact region of the SARS-CoV RBD (Li et al., 2005a). Other RBD residues have some influence on cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV (Li, 2013).",

The MERS-CoV RBD also has two subdomains (Fig. 6A), the core with a central five-stranded \u03b2-sheet and three disulphide bridges, as well as an inserted or external subdomain between two core \u03b2-strands (Chen et al., 2013, Lu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2013). The central \u03b2-sheet of the core is surrounded by polypeptides that connect the \u03b2-strands and contain helical structures (Fig. 6A). The core has an overall globular shape. The inserted subdomain is distal from the RBD terminal side and has a four-stranded \u03b2-sheet (Fig. 6A). The \u03b2-sheet and a long loop that connects the \u03b2-strands at one edge of the sheet clamp the core subdomain, as in the SARS-CoV RBD (Fig. 4A). The cores are more similar in MERS- and SARS-CoV than the external subdomain (Fig. 6B), which is longer in the MERS (80 residues) than the SARS RBD (65 residues). Because of the extended \u03b2-sheet, the solvent-exposed region of the inserted subdomain is broader than that of SARS-CoV. The first (\u03b26) and last (\u03b29) \u03b2-strands of the MERS-CoV inserted subdomain align with the two \u03b2-strands of the SARS-CoV inserted subdomain, but the other two \u03b2-strands (\u03b27 and \u03b28) are absent in the SARS RBD (Fig. 6B). The MERS-CoV inserted subdomain contains a concave surface or small \u201ccanyon\u201d formed by the \u03b2-strands and the loop that connect \u03b26 and \u03b27 (Fig. 6A). This \u201ccanyon\u201d is very distant from the terminal side and exposed for receptor recognition. It is absent in the SARS-CoV RBD, which contains a long loop in this location (Fig. 6B). Likely, these differences in the external subdomains are the major determinants of the distinct receptor-binding specificity between the MERS- and SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "An interesting feature of MERS-CoV binding to DPP4, also shown in the PRCV\u2013APN complex (Fig. 3A, bottom), is the RBD interaction with N-linked receptor carbohydrates (Fig. 7B). The first three carbohydrates attached to DPP4 Asn229 are well defined in the crystal structures of the MERS-CoV RBD\u2013DPP4 complex (Lu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2013). They interact with several solvent-exposed residues in the virus protein (Fig. 7B). The first NAG residue is hydrogen-bonded to RBD Glu536, whereas the second NAG of the glycan stacks onto the aromatic ring of viral Trp535, which strengthens the glycan\u2013virus interaction and probably stabilizes the motif conformation. The third mannose residue in the DPP4 N-linked glycan also interacts with the RBD tryptophan. Another glycan at DPP4 Asn281 in blade IV is very close to the RBD (not shown), but does not interact with the virus protein. The conformation of this last glycan appears to be determined by its interaction with a tryptophan residue (Trp187) in the DPP4 protein (Lu et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2013), and could be critical for MERS-CoV RBD binding to DPP4. A highly flexible glycan in this position could prevent this virus\u2013receptor interaction, such as shown for glycosylations in APN or ACE2.",

In several CoV such as TGEV, beta1-CoV and IBV, the NTD preserves glycan binding activity, whereas in MHV it binds to a protein, CEACAM1 (Peng et al., 2012, Tsai et al., 2003). The CoV NTD has diverged from galectins and recognizes proteins or sialic acids rather than N-acetyl lactosamine; the mode of ligand recognition also differs (Peng et al., 2012). Although the side of the NTD that recognizes cell surface molecules is the same side as the galectin CRD that binds carbohydrates, the top of the carbohydrate-binding \u03b2-sheet is covered by polypeptides that shape the receptor-binding region in CoV (Fig. 8, Fig. 9A). In addition, a glycan N-linked to one edge of the \u03b2-sheet further prevents ligand binding to the carbohydrate-binding sheet in galectins. This region is similar in MHV, which binds CEACAM1, and in bCoV, which binds sialic acid, showing that the NTD has evolved in CoV to specifically select cell entry receptors.",

The CEACAM mediate homo- and heterophilic cell adhesion. There are two murine CEACAM genes, CEACAM1 and CEACAM2. CEACAM1 has four splice forms, which have two (D1, D4) or four (D1\u2013D4) Ig-like domains in the extracellular region, as well as a transmembrane region and two distinct cytoplasmic tails (Beauchemin et al., 1999). All four CEACAM1 variants can be used as entry receptors by MHV (Dveksler et al., 1993). CEACAM1 is also a receptor for virulent Neisseria strains (Virji et al., 1999).",

The N-terminal residues form a \u201csocket\u201d that contains a hydrophobic amino acid, Leu160, at the bottom (Fig. 9A). Ile41 of CEACAM1 is exposed in the D1 CC\u2032 loop and penetrates the socket (Fig. 9B). MHV Tyr15, Leu89 and Leu160 contact the Ile41 side chain (Fig. 9C), and comprise a critical virus\u2013receptor motif (Peng et al., 2011, Tan et al., 2002). Surrounding residues in the CEACAM1 CC\u2032 loop, Thr39 and Asp42, form hydrogen bonds with the MHV N-RBD (Fig. 9C), which confirms the importance of this receptor region in virus recognition.",

The NTD of these CoV were proposed have a similar fold, which was confirmed by the crystal structure of the bCoV NTD (Peng et al., 2012). As in the MHV structure (Fig. 8), the bCoV NTD has polypeptides on the top of the galectin-like \u03b2-sandwich.

This domain has a galectin-like core, which indicates it was incorporated into the CoV S from a host (Li, 2012, Peng et al., 2011). It has evolved in some CoV to recognize cell surface molecules such as sialic acids, or in MHV to bind the CEACAM1 protein (Fig. 1). CoV NTD has integrated polypeptides and an N-linked glycan on the top of the flat galectin-like \u03b2-sandwich, which covers the galactose-binding \u03b2-sheet in galectins (Fig. 8). The virus-specific conformation of the polypeptides at the top of the NTD probably determine its receptor-binding specificity (Peng et al., 2012). The MHV NTD contains a socket for specific recognition of a unique structural feature in the CEACAM1 D1 (Fig. 9). Acquisition of the galectin-like NTD from the host probably expanded CoV host cell tropism, as shown for the TGEV NTD that confers enteric tropism (Schultze et al., 1996), although MHV and related beta-CoV only use the NTD for recognition of cell surface molecules (Fig. 1). The receptor-binding function of the S1 C-terminal portion appears to have been lost in these CoV. It would be interesting to explore the conformation of this region, which could provide clues to its presumed lack of function.",

Alpha- and beta-CoV RBD adopt two distinct folds, but bind only to ectoenzymes; the NL63- and SARS-CoV bind to the same protein, ACE2 (Fig. 1). Some of these enzyme features must be essential for CoV entry into host cells. Perhaps they cluster with other proteases that facilitate fusion (Glowacka et al., 2011). ACE2, APN and DPP4 have distinct structures and functions, but their ectodomains share an inherent conformational flexibility (Boonacker and Van Noorden, 2003, Towler et al., 2004, Xu et al., 1997) that could assist in dissociation of the S1\u2013S2 heterotrimer. Trimeric spikes that bind simultaneously to several receptor molecules could disassemble by pulling forces generated during ectodomain movement. The conformation and dynamics of the APN ectodomain vary with the pH (unpublished data), so that endosomal acidification can alter APN conformation during receptor-mediated endocytosis.",

            "text": "Alpha-CoV RBD adopt a conserved \u03b2-barrel fold (Fig. 2) (Reguera et al., 2012, Wu et al., 2009). S1 C-terminal fragments of the IBV gamma-CoV and the bulbul delta-CoV share certain sequence similarity with the alpha-CoV RBD, and could have a similar fold (Reguera et al., 2012). Crystal structures of alpha-CoV in complex with receptors identified the receptor-binding regions in the RBD (Reguera et al., 2012, Wu et al., 2009), which have remarkable structural variability (Fig. 2). The conformation of the \u03b2-barrel tip dictates the receptor molecule used by alpha-CoV for host cell entry. RBD with protruding tips determine alpha-CoV attachment to APN, whereas those with blunt RBD tips recognize ACE2 and perhaps other yet uncharacterized receptor molecules. Structures of alpha-CoV RBD in complex with APN or ACE2 show two opposite modes of CoV\u2013receptor recognition (Reguera et al., 2012, Wu et al., 2009) (Fig. 3). In viruses, recessed surfaces hide conserved receptor-binding residues from antibodies (Casasnovas, 2013, Rossmann, 1989); hCoV-NL63 uses a recessed surface to recognize exposed ACE2 motifs, following a receptor-binding strategy similar to the other beta-CoV reviewed here. CoV binding to APN is unique among CoV, and contrasts with the mode of ACE2 and DPP4 recognition. The bidentate, protruding RBD tip of alpha1-CoV, which has two exposed aromatic residues, penetrates small cavities of the APN ectodomain (Fig. 3A). Similarly to MERS-CoV, the alpha1-CoV also recognizes a dimeric cell surface protein.",

Both have a core with a single \u03b2-sheet and an additional subdomain that recognizes cell entry molecules. MERS- and SARS-CoV show extraordinary potential for cross-species transmission, related to S binding to distinct orthologous receptor molecules. This is probably linked to the specific structure of their RBD, especially to the extended receptor-binding surfaces of the inserted subdomains (Fig. 4, Fig. 6). A few changes in those large surfaces increase affinity for receptor molecules in new hosts, while preserving virus growth (Holmes, 2005, Li et al., 2005c). Measles virus (MV) follows a similar strategy for recognition of several receptors that facilitate virus growth and transmission (Casasnovas, 2013). The MV hemagglutinin uses a broad concave surface to bind to three distinct receptor molecules, a unique feature of MV among the paramyxoviruses. The use of a large receptor recognition surface probably enables virus dissemination in tissues and host-to-host virus transmission.",

MERS-CoV uses a small \u201ccanyon\u201d to bind to an \u03b1-helix in the linker between blades IV and V of the DPP4 \u03b2-propeller (Fig. 7), whereas the curved inserted subdomain in SARS-CoV RBD cradles the N-terminal \u03b1-helix of ACE2 (Fig. 4). The mode by which these CoV bind to receptors shows similarities to other CoV\u2013receptor interactions, particularly to hCoV-NL63, which also binds to ACE2 (Fig. 3B). NL63- and SARS-CoV recognize overlapping ACE2 regions, including two helices and a \u03b2-turn in the virus-binding lobe of the receptor. The ACE2-binding surfaces in both CoV are concave and are distant from the terminal end of the RBD. The receptor-binding surface in SARS-CoV is more extended and curved than in hCoV-NL63, and interacts more extensively with the ACE2 N-terminal \u03b1-helix; the two residues involved in SARS-CoV adaptation to humans (Asn479 and Thr487) interact directly with the \u03b1-helix.",

RBD protein can elicit potent neutralizing Ab and protective immune responses (Du et al., 2009). These neutralizing Ab recognize the exposed receptor-binding tyrosine or tryptophan in TGEV or PRCV (Reguera et al., 2012). In the SARS-CoV, structural studies showed that several neutralizing Ab bind to the receptor-binding subdomain (Fig. 5) (Hwang et al., 2006, Pak et al., 2009, Prabakaran et al., 2006). These results indicate that the receptor-binding regions are under selective pressure from the immune system. In alpha-CoV, this pressure could mediate the notable conformational changes in the RBD tip (Fig. 2), which alter receptor-binding specificity. The APN-binding tip in alpha-CoV RBD has exposed receptor-binding residues that are easily targeted by Ab, whereas the recessed ACE2-binding tip in hCoV-NL63 more efficiently hides conserved receptor-binding residues from immune surveillance.",

They are thought to have evolved from a common CoV RBD ancestor (Li, 2012). They share some common features, such as recognition of glycans N-linked to receptors, and the presence of parallel \u03b2-strands (\u03b21, \u03b23, \u03b27 in TGEV and \u03b22, \u03b211 in MERS, Fig. 2, Fig. 6). It is tempting to speculate that this precursor RBD had a \u03b2-barrel fold similar to the alpha-CoV, with a variable tip that accommodated different receptor molecules. In SARS and MERS beta-CoV, the RBD lost the \u03b2-barrel fold, but maintained two \u03b2-sheets, one of which forms a large receptor-binding platform with recessed surfaces that bind to specific motifs in cell surface molecules. The receptor-binding subdomains in SARS and MERS beta-CoV appear to specialize in recognition of orthologous receptor molecules. The beta-CoV RBD probably evolved to enhance host-to-host transmission, responsible for the recurrent CoV outbreaks in man.",
