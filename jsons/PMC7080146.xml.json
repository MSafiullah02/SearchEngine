The transmission of infectious disease can be influenced profoundly by heterogeneities in behaviours, with implications for management (Woolhouse et al. 1997; Cross et al. 2009). Disease transmission is facilitated in group-living mammals on three levels: within and between social groups and also between populations. Behaviours of epidemiological importance can include local movements (e.g. brucellosis in bison Bison bison; Kilpatrick et al. 2009), dispersal (e.g. chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus; Clements et al. 2011), intra-specific aggression (e.g. Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease in Tasmanian devils Sarcophilus harrisii; McCallum and Jones 2006), social and reproductive interactions (e.g. rabies in African wild dogs Lycaon pictus; Gascoyne et al. 1993) and denning behaviour [e.g. bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula; Caley et al. 1998].",

Such individuals may exhibit behaviours that bring them into contact with more sources of infection and/or provide more opportunities to transmit these pathogens to others (e.g. Natoli et al. 2005; Easterbrook et al. 2007; Boyer et al. 2010). While differences in behavioural patterns, particularly relating to social interaction and space use, can be predictable and have been shown to influence disease dynamics, identifying the underlying mechanisms is challenging.",

In the first instance, such heterogeneities may be driven by fixed parameters such as sex and age (Altizer et al. 2003). Some studies have found that sexually mature males may be more important in the spread of parasites than females, for example in terms of exhibited behaviours and also the greater susceptibility of males to infection due to testosterone-induced immune-compromise (Zuk and McKean 1996; Perkins et al. 2003; Skorping and Jensen 2004). Alternatively, differences could be more under the control of the individual, with studies showing that individuals displaying more exploratory behaviours have a greater probability of contracting and/or transmitting disease (e.g. Natoli et al. 2005). For example, cattle and deer were found to vary in the level of \u2018curiosity\u2019 that they show to dead possums (a potential host for bTB) on pasture, which in turn is likely to influence their probability of exposure to the pathogen (Sauter and Morris 1995). In the second instance, the behaviour of infected animals can be important if it is in some way different from that of healthier individuals. Animals in an advanced state of disease may be impaired and unable to compete and/or forage effectively, so are ostracised from a group or forced to forage in marginal areas (e.g. Cheeseman and Mallinson 1981).",

Culling badgers to control bTB in British cattle has resulted in complex outcomes, largely attributed to culling-induced behavioural changes in badgers (Donnelly et al. 2005; Carter et al. 2007; Riordan et al. 2011). Badgers exhibit flexibility in social structure across their geographic range from pair to group living (Johnson et al. 2000). In moderate-to-high-density populations, badgers usually live in groups of six to eight individuals associated with a group territory (Roper 2010). In populations where disease has been recorded (with bTB being most prevalent in high-density regions), bTB infection appears to be highly spatially aggregated (Delahay et al. 2000a; Woodroffe et al. 2005a) and transmission rates, non-linear with respect to host density (Smith et al. 1995; Barlow 2001).",

            "text": "Badgers live in communal underground dens known as setts, and as the principal route of bTB infection among badgers appears to be via the respiratory system (Cheeseman et al. 1989), with bite wounding representing an important secondary route (Jenkins et al. 2012), close and prolonged contact between individuals in setts would be expected to facilitate M. bovis transmission. Most territories in high-density populations contain between three to six dens, loosely categorised as \u2018main\u2019 or \u2018outlier\u2019 setts (Neal and Cheeseman 1996; Roper 2010). In general, there is one, or more rarely two, main sett(s) per territory serving as the primary, year-round social group residence(s) (Neal and Roper 1991). Speculation remains as to the function of generally smaller, but more numerous, outlier setts that have fewer entrance holes and tend to be only occupied intermittently (Kruuk 1978; Harris et al. 1989; Macdonald et al. 2004). Individuals have been shown to vary in the extent to which they use main vs outlier setts (Roper et al. 2001; Kowalczyk et al. 2004; B\u00f6hm et al. 2008). In a study carried out at Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, a significant positive correlation was found between the number of setts in a territory and the positive bTB status of the group (Rogers et al. 2003), which raises the possibility that the use of outlier setts may be related to disease dynamics (also suggested by Roper et al. 2001). Field evidence from badger populations infected with bTB strongly suggests that transmission risks for this disease in badgers are closely related to the extent of movement between social groups (Vicente et al. 2007) and associated behaviours such as aggressive encounters (Jenkins et al. 2012). There is some evidence that bTB test-positive badgers range more widely and/or use outlier setts more frequently than apparently uninfected individuals (Cheeseman and Mallinson 1981; Woodroffe et al. 1999). For example, Garnett et al. (2005) found that bTB-infected badgers had home ranges that were 50 % larger and that they foraged 65 % further away from their own main sett, on average than test-negative badgers.",

We test (a) how sett use patterns of badgers differ across seasons at (1) the functional group level (sex, age) and (2) individual-based level (e.g. body condition, bite wound score) and (b) how repeatable an individual\u2019s sett use patterns are over time.

All collared animals were located at their setts once every day between 08:00 and 15:00 GMT, during which time the animals may move around underground but are not expected to change setts (Roper 2010). This was done using a R1000 receiver (Sirtrack Ltd., Havelock, New Zealand) and a Yagi antenna (Biotrack, Dorset, UK) on 28 consecutive days in each of the four seasons [summer (26 June 2009\u201323 July 2009); autumn (23 September 2009\u201320 October 2009); winter (10 January 2010\u20136 February 2010); spring (16 April 2010\u201313 May 2010)]. Setts were allocated to social group territories using the results of an annual bait-marking exercise (for details, see Delahay et al. 2000b). Sett classifications (main vs outlier) were known from the long-term bait-marking and trapping records, but generally, main setts had more than five entrances, large spoil heaps with obvious runs and entrance holes with signs of occupation throughout the year (see also Kruuk 1978; Harris et al. 1989). Outliers had fewer entrance holes and appeared to be used less frequently. The underground location of the animal within the sett was recorded using VHF radio-telemetry to pinpoint a location on the surface where the badger was assumed to be resting underground (as per: Butler and Roper 1996; Roper et al. 2001).",

Test sensitivity and specificity combined were at least 85 and 93 %, respectively (Dalley et al. 2008; Chambers et al. 2009). A positive result with either diagnostic test was evidence of current infection with M. bovis. Additionally, analyses were re-run using only the results from the less sensitive Stat-Pak test (sens. 54 %) as antibody production is positively correlated with the extent and severity of bTB infection in badgers (Chambers et al. 2008, 2009), making this the most effective test available for identifying progressed infection in a live animal (see Supplementary Material). Too few of the individuals sampled were found to be actively excreting M. bovis at the time of a culture test, and thus, this measure of disease status could not be included in our analyses. Because some truly infected individuals may have been undetected using the above tests and animals captured more frequently had a greater probability of yielding a positive result, we calculated the number of capture events for test-positive and test-negative animals to ensure that both were sampled with comparable intensity.",

This provides a putative mechanism that might help to explain the finding by Rogers et al. (2003) that the more occupied setts there were in a territory, the higher the TB index of the group, assuming a correlation between occupancy rates and frequency of outlier use by individual badgers. It is also consistent with previous observations that badgers infected with M. bovis ranged more widely than apparently uninfected individuals (Garnett et al. 2005). While bTB status was inferred from a combination of imperfect diagnostic tests (see Supplementary Material for further discussion), they are nonetheless the most sensitive tests currently available for identifying established infection with M. bovis in a live animal (Chambers et al. 2008; 2009). Furthermore, the tests are of high specificity and, crucially, the rate of false negatives would not have been expected to vary according to the degree to which individuals used main or outlier setts.",

            "text": "As outlier setts, on average, tend to be located closer to boundaries with neighbouring groups than main setts (reviewed in Roper 2010), it is possible that encounters between badgers from different social groups occur more frequently at or near to outliers than main setts (e.g. at boundary latrines or on foraging grounds). There may be a link between ranging more widely and the frequent use of outlier setts, which may also result in an increased risk of exposure to infectious agents. Also, setts themselves may be a source of infection, the constant temperature, darkness and high humidity characteristic of badger setts being conducive to the prolonged survival of M. bovis (Jackson et al. 1995). A number of studies of other species have reported that bolder animals that elicited a greater number of encounters with con-specifics were more likely to be infected by parasites and diseases than timid individuals (e.g. Natoli et al. 2005; Easterbrook et al. 2007; Boyer et al. 2010). Using repeatability measures developed by Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2010), we found that those animals that used outlier setts more frequently relative to other individuals in one season were more likely to do the same in the following season (relative to other individuals). There may also be other individual-level factors that influence the probability of infection; for example, in vertebrates, immune system functioning (and its effectiveness) depends on the innate availability of particular major histocompatibility alleles and also previous exposure to parasites (Woelfing et al. 2009; Sin et al. 2012).",

Cheeseman and Mallinson (1981) radio-tracked three badgers in an advanced stage of bTB infection and found that they ranged more widely and were more likely to use outliers than test-negative individuals. Anecdotal observations suggest that, in general, when badgers are diseased, injured or elderly they are more likely to exhibit \u2018unusual\u2019 behaviours with reports of them moving to outlier setts to die. In the present study, although animals that used outlier setts to a greater extent were more likely to be Stat-Pak positive (a correlate of progressed disease), they did not exhibit levels of bite wounds consistent with increased aggression from conspecifics.",

From February to May cubs are born and mothers are suckling dependent young (Woodroffe et al. 2005b). During this time, females utilised the main sett to a greater extent than both sub-adult and adult males. The younger non-breeding females spent the similar amounts of time at the main sett as breeding females, but there is little evidence that badgers exhibit allo-parental behaviours (but see Woodroffe 1993) or where it has been observed that it provides significant fitness benefits (Woodroffe and Macdonald 2000; Dugdale et al. 2010). Extra-group paternity among badgers is high (Carpenter et al. 2005; Dugdale et al. 2007), and although atypical for group-living terrestrial carnivores, both male and female badgers may seek extra-group mating opportunities. Thus, the use of outlier setts by both sexes may be a symptom of spending more time at the edges and/or outside their resident territory. These results are consistent with mature males making forays into the territories of other social groups for mating opportunities in spring and females doing the same in autumn when they are not rearing young. All animals spent a greater proportion of time at the main sett in winter and markedly less time there in summer. In the colder months, nest chamber sharing in the main sett may confer thermoregulatory benefits (Kaneko et al. 2010), while in the summer badgers may use outliers more often and frequently move between setts to prevent ecto-parasites such as fleas from accumulating in their bedding (Butler and Roper 1996; Roper et al. 2001; Stewart and Macdonald 2003).",

Focusing effort on outlier setts, as well as main setts, might therefore expedite the objectives of any management intervention targeted at badger setts (e.g. vaccination and/or culling). If resources are limited, it may be cost-effective for the intervention to be targeted at main setts in autumn as a greater proportion of animals were found to be resident at main setts during this time (and still active unlike in winter), but in the case of an oral vaccine delivered in bait, this should be weighed against the benefits of targeting susceptible cubs when they first emerge from the setts in spring (Delahay et al. 2003). Overall, for effective wildlife disease control in any host\u2013pathogen system, it is important to factor in host behaviours and consider how these may vary between functional groups, cohorts and/or individuals in a population and the implications that this may have for pathogen transmission.",
