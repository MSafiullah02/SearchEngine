Their genomic sizes range from 25.4 to 31.7 kb in length (Woo et al., 2012) in the following arrangement: 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a and 1b, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), non\u2010structural protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), non\u2010structural protein 7 (NS7) and 3\u2032 UTR (Lee & Lee, 2014; Woo et al., 2012). The subfamily comprises four genera that is Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gamacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first reported in Hong Kong in 2012 as an emerging genus prevalent in certain animal species, including swine (Woo et al., 2012). Infection by PDCoV can be symptomatically compared with other porcine enteric coronavirus diseases caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV); however, PDCoV exhibits milder symptoms and lower mortality rates in affected neonatal piglets (Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014).",

Due to the cold and harsh environment, few viral infections have been reported in animals in these areas until recent years. Tibetan pigs had no history of travel to areas where a prevalence of CoVs had been reported earlier. Nevertheless, livestock such as pigs and yaks (Bos grunniens), which have been associated with clinical diarrhoeal disease have been reported in these provinces (Gong et al., 2014; Wang, Lan, & Yang, 2016). Prevalence of diarrhoeal disease in yaks that were farmed together with Tibetan pigs inspired us to determine whether PDCoV is present in Tibetan pigs. We therefore investigated the prevalence and full\u2010length genome sequences of PDCoV from clinical cases associated with diarrhoea from Tibetan pigs surrounding the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau of China.",

Additionally, all Tibetan pigs infected with PDCoV were under one month of age, therefore, indicating that the prevalence of PDCoV was related to the ages of Tibetan pigs (Table 1), consistent with previous studies (Mai et al., 2017; Song et al., 2015).

The lower prevalence of PDCoV and PEDV in Tibetan pigs that is demonstrated in our study is consistent with the prevalence of other pathogens infecting the Tibetan pigs (Fan et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2014). These results provide further evidence that Tibetan pigs show striking physiological differences from lowland piglets. The cold and harsh environment might be another factor that affects the transmission and infection of pathogens and caused a lower prevalence of PDCoV and PEDV in Tibetan pigs. Yaks, another livestock living in the same environment as Tibetan pigs, also have a lower prevalence of Hepatitis E virus (HEV)(Xu et al., 2014) and bovine hokovirus (Xu et al., 2016). Both these studies show the effects of environment to pathogens transmission and infection, and these factors should not be ignored in future studies, especially in studies of the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau.",

            "text": "In conclusion, diarrhoeal samples collected from Tibetan pigs inhabiting the regions surrounding the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau of China were screened for the prevalence of PDCoV, and for the first time, we confirmed the presence of PDCoV in Tibetan pigs. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the PDCoV in Tibetan pigs is closely related to strain CHN\u2010AH\u20102004, which was discovered in Anhui province, mainland China; however, these strains are different, suggesting the continuous evolution and adaption of PDCoV to its hosts in special field conditions. Our results also complement the geographical lineage theory of global PDCoV distribution. Furthermore, investigating variations in other genes will also provide additional data to determine the diversity of the PDCoV genome, and we strongly suggest that effective vaccination against PDCoV is not ignored in Tibetan pigs in the studied areas.",
