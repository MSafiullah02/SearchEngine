Without such an understanding, it will be difficult to anticipate and respond quickly to the effects of environmental changes on the health of humans, other animals, and plants. As the pace of anthropogenic change continues to accelerate, basic research will be essential to anticipating impacts and potential management or policy interventions. Whether the relevant questions concern long-range impacts of global climate change, more effective control of familiar pandemic diseases with animal vectors and reservoirs, or securing our food supply against the increasing threat of bioterrorism, the ecological dimensions of infectious disease are fundamental and poorly understood.",

The program focuses on interdisciplinary research projects that take advantage of the wide range of theoretical and methodological advances developed over the past 30 years by ecologists, physicians, veterinarians, microbiologists, disease specialists, and others such as geospatial and computational experts. It is a multiagency initiative because of the interdisciplinary nature of the questions being addressed, and because of the funding challenges facing truly ecological studies of disease transmission. While a handful of such studies had been funded, such as those of Terry Yates and colleagues in deciphering the cause of outbreaks of hanta virus (Yates et al., 2002) and Richard Ostfeld and colleagues in uncovering the complex story behind Lyme disease (Schauber et al., 2005), funding for disease ecology was scarce. At NSF, such projects were seen as too applied and too human-centric for an agency whose primary mission was support of basic research. At NIH, this type of research was considered, with occasional exceptions in vector biology, too field-oriented and far removed from biomedical research. Something was needed to fill this gap.",

By predictive understanding, we mean that at the heart of any EID project must be a model that can be used to pull together the pieces of the disease puzzle so that we might be able to predict and control disease spread and effects. That model might be conceptual, but more often it is analytical or statistical. The challenge for disease ecology is to unravel these systems, discover how complex they truly are, and to determine if they can be predicted and controlled using targeted environmental, public health, or medical interventions.",

A number of the awards involve co-funding among one or more of these organizations and their components. The EID program has supported a broad array of studies on a variety of infectious diseases. The majority of the projects involve potential human pathogens, although they do not necessarily include a human component to the study. Projects also focus on diseases of other animals or plants. The range of host species includes: humans, primates, sea lions, cape buffalo, mule deer, wild dogs, raccoons, fruit bats, deer mice, prairie dogs, rainforest birds, tortoises, frogs, honey bees, shellfish, sea fans, grasses, and soybeans. The list of pathogens/diseases is equally long and include: echinococcosis, schistosomiasis, malaria, chagas, Hantavirus, rabies, dengue, West Nile virus, chronic wasting disease, plague, cholera, and chitrid fungi. Overall, the projects are divided roughly one-third each among viral pathogens, pathogenic bacteria, and protists or multicellular parasites (Table 1). The projects range among terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats (Table 2). Research topics range from the abstract (e.g., investigations of the impact of social behavior on spheroid transfer processes among honeybees) to environmental intervention and human epidemiology studies. Nearly all projects are both interdisciplinary and targeted at the development of new concepts and methods to predict and prevent infectious diseases.\n\n\n",

However, increased recognition of the role of nonmedical events in influencing outbreaks of diseases such as SARS, the potential for bioterrorism, and the current global spread of avian influenza has added new urgency and made this a front-page issue. Recent trends in grant applications, government sponsored reports (e.g., Smolinski et al., 2003; Knobler et al., 2006), and a talks at various conferences suggest that there is growing recognition of the potential power of predictive ecological research that involves multiple disciplines and may span multiple spatial scales in order to achieve a quantitative understanding of disease transmission mechanisms. We believe that such research can help develop better predictive tools and the knowledge to minimize the prevalence of disease or even to prevent outbreaks before they occur. When integrated with research on vaccines, therapeutics, and other public health and environmental interventions, ecological studies may yield very powerful disease prevention and management tools.",

While disease ecology research is teasing apart the complexities of multiple hosts and vectors, nearly all focuses on just a single disease organism at a time. Can we develop truly useful predictive models for these complex ecological processes that are spatially and temporally explicit? This last is the ultimate question.

The questions posed above will likely result in a shift in the focus of proposals submitted to the EID program, for example, more projects that examine pathogen evolution. Our goal is to maintain the EID program as a broad, interdisciplinary program that will not only produce predictive understanding of disease dynamics, but also take that understanding, where possible, to the next level and translate knowledge into specific testable interventions.
