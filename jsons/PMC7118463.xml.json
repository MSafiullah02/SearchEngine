There are also references of fish ponds in The Old Testament and in Egyptian hieroglyphics of the Middle Kingdom. Fish farms were common in Europe in Roman times and a recent study of land forms in the Bolivian Amazon has revealed a complex array of fish weirs that pre-date the Hispanic era [1,2]. Despite its ancient origin, aquaculture remained a low-level farming activity until the mid-20th century when experimental husbandry practices for salmon, trout and a mass of tropical fish and shrimp species were developed. Nowadays, aquaculture is commended to be a major global industry, with a total annual production exceeding 80 million ton and estimated value of almost 230 billion US dollar (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, FAO, 2016). In the past three decades, aquaculture industry has made impressive progress and constitutes high quality protein for world population accounting for nearly 50% of the global food fish supply in 2016. In addition to being an important form of nutrition, aquaculture is also a critical form of employment (FAO, 2018).",

Over 350 different species of aquatic animals are cultured in global in freshwater, brackishwater and marine environments. In 2016, the yield of freshwater fish production reached 46.6 million ton (FAO, 2016). Carps (Cyprinidae) make up almost 65% of the global farmed freshwater fish production and are an important source of food in China and India where 72.8% and 13.8%, respectively, of farmed cyprinid are produced (FAO, 2016). Economic aquaculture species belonging to cyprinid principally include grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), crucian carp (Carassius auratus), black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) and blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala), etc. Meanwhile, in the international ornamental fish trade, more than 90% of the freshwater fishes are farm bred, and about 4000 species of freshwater ornamental fishes are traded every year [3]. Goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus) and koi (Cyprinus carpio haematopterus) are the most extensively traded fish species [4].",

In the past century, the rise of new forms of intensive aquaculture, the increasing global movement of aquatic animals and their products, and various artificial pressures to aquatic ecosystems have led to the emergence and outbreak of numbers of diseases in fishes. The global expansion of fish farming industry and the consequent improvement in fish health monitoring have led to discovery of several new scientific viruses, which are almost endemic in local population and overflow opportunistically to infect fishes in aquaculture facilities, while other well-known fish viruses also cause significant losses in aquaculture.",

As people pay more and more attention to the quality and safety of aquatic products and environmental pollution, the utilization of various chemical drugs to prevent diseases in aquaculture animals has been increasingly questioned. At present, prevention and control of aquaculture diseases mainly include methods of drug control and immune prevention. The potential risks of drug resistance, allergic reactions and poisoning reactions caused by drug residues have a serious impact on the environment, farmed animals and consumption of cultured products. Immunoprevention can not only improve the specific immunity of fish, but also can enhance the ability to resist stress, meeting the requirements of no environment pollution and no residues in aquatic products. Due to its ability to safely and effectively prevent aquaculture diseases, vaccine has become the mainstream technology for prevention and control of aquatic diseases in the world. Vaccination has also become the normative production standard for international modern aquaculture. In the late 1990s, the commercialization of fish vaccines developed rapidly and as a result, there are 38 global approvals in 2003, over 100 in 2006, and over 140 in 2012 according to incomplete statistics [7].",

First detected in the late 1990s, KHVD has been found in different continents (Europa, Asia, North America and Africa), leading to serious worldwide financial losses in common carp and koi culture industries. Once fish are infected, the virus could persists for some period of time in a latent or carrier state without obvious clinical signs [11]. Molecular analysis shows that little variation among isolates is found, as it might be expected for a virus that is being rapidly disseminated by the global movement of infected fish [12].",

In addition to its negative economical and societal impacts, KHVD has also a negative environmental impact by affecting wild populations of carp. In addition, hybrids of common carp and goldfish show partly susceptibility to KHV infection, however the mortality rate is observed to be rather limited [14]. Cohabitation experiments indicate that some carp species such as goldfish, common bream (Abramis brama), silver carp and grass carp, can carry KHV asymptomatically and transmit it to wild carp [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. KHVD is seasonal, occurring when water temperature is between 18 \u00b0C and 28 \u00b0C. It is highly contagious and extremely virulent with mortality rate up to 80%\u2013100%. Fish infected with KHV and kept at 23\u201328 \u00b0C die between 5 and 22 dpi (days post infection) with a peak of mortality between 8 and 12 dpi [8,20,21]. Carp of all ages, from juveniles upwards, are affected by KHV, but younger fish (1\u20133 months, 2.5\u20136 g) seem to be more susceptible to infection than mature fish (1 year old, nearly 230 g) [22].",

CyHV-3 is a member of genus Cyprinivirus, family Alloherpesviridae, order Herpesvirales [29]. The Alloherpesviridae is a newly designated family which regroups herpesviruses infecting fish and amphibians [30], being divided into four genera: Cyprinivirus, Ictalurivirus, Salmonivirus and Batrachovirus [29]. The genus Cyprinivirus contains viruses that infect common carp (cyprinid herpesvirus, CyHV-1 and CyHV-3), goldfish (cyprinid herpesvirus 2, CyHV-2) and freshwater eel (anguillid herpesvirus 1, AngHV-1) (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, ICTV, 2017). The genome of CyHV-3 is a typical herpesvirus containing a 295 kb, linear, double stranded DNA molecule consisting of a large central portion flanked by two 22 kb repeat regions [31]. So far, it is the largest genome among all sequenced herpesviruses [32].",

            "text": "Immune system of vertebrate recognizes virus particles by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which senses particular protein ligand and virus nucleic acids [39]. PRRs detect viral pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to trigger intracellular innate immune pathways and subsequent adaptive immune responses by producing cytokines, chemokines, T-cell stimulatory factors, etc [40]. Mammalian cells have the capacity to detect viral proteins using a series of receptors, such as cell surface toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) [41] and a multiple set of cytoplasm receptors to viral DNA including a DNA dependent activator of interferon regulatory factors (DAI) [42], the interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) [43] and RNA polymerase III [44]. In teleost, endosome TLR9 has been identified in numbers of carp species [[45], [46], [47]], but further information on receptors for viral DNA remains unclear and the recognition mechanism of CyHV-3 by cyprinid cells need further research. The recognition of viral molecular patterns leads to the production of type I interferon (IFN\u2014I), which is crucial in antiviral response to many virus infections [[48], [49], [50]]. IFNs bind to specific cell-surface receptors, then trigger the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway and subsequently activate interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), which encode for a wide array of proteins with antiviral properties [51]. In carp cells, CyHV-3 can be interfered by the activation of IFN-I. poly(I:C) stimulation in fibroblastic carp cells induces the expression of IFN-I, limiting CyHV-3 infectivity and replication, delaying the spreading of CyHV-3 in vitro [52]. In carp infected by CyHV-3, IFN-I response is detected in skin at 24 h post infection [53] and subsequently in spleen [52]. IFN-I system triggers the expression of a quantity of genes encoding antiviral proteins, including grass carp reovirus-induced genes 1 (GIG-1) protein, ubiquitin like protein (ISG15) and ubiquitin specific protease 18 (USP18), inhibiting viral replication directly [52]. Furthermore, in CyHV-3 infected carp, genes encoding chemotactic cytokines of CC family are up-regulated [54]. Additional observation indicated that the induced inflammation may derive from the rapid prominent leukocytosis in the blood cycle of carps during the initial two days after CyHV-3 infection. Complement system also participate in the reaction against CyHV-3 displayed as pathway triggering and complement hemolytic activity increasing in blood plasma [52]. The activation of the complement system leads to neutralisation of viruses, phagocytosis of coated virus particles or elimination of virus infected cells by lysis. In conclusion, innate immune system including IFN-I, inflammation and complement are induced by CyHV-3 infection, while the importance for resisting the infection still needs to be addressed in greater detail.",

It exhibits an enveloped, bullet-shaped virion and measures \u223c80\u2013180 nm in length and 60\u201390 nm in diameter [55,56]. It has a negative-sense, ssRNA genome of \u223c11 kb, containing five ORFs encoding five structural proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (L). The five viral genes are organized in the typical order of rhabdoviruses: 3\u2032\u2014N\u2014P\u2013M\u2013G\u2013L-5\u2019 [[57], [58], [59]]. Genotypes of SVCV isolates from various locations form four major genetic clades [60]. SVCV isolates of the recent emergence and geographic range expansion link to the spread of the virus within China where common carp are reared in large numbers for food and koi are reared for export [61]. It is responsible for the highly contagious SVC, especially in common carp [55,62,63].",

SVCV infection has now emerged in many European countries, including the UK, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Spain, France, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and Russia associated with numerous financial losses in common carp and koi [60,61,[67], [68], [69], [70]]. These outbreaks occur in both farmed and wild fishes suggesting the expansion of influenced range. The emergence of SVC in region where is free of SVC, such as North America, Asia and in portions of Europe, appears to be the consequence of both improved surveillance and the large volume of ornamental fish global shipment.",

Other risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality include fish density, geographical location, fish species and the immune status of susceptible fish [71]. SVCV infection can spread by fomites and parasitic in vertebrates. Natural SVCV infections have been reported in other cyprinid fish, including goldfish, koi, silver carp, crucian carp, bighead carp, grass carp, tench (Tinca tinca) and orfe (Leuciscus idus) [55,62,72]. Experimental infections have been reported in zebrafish (Danio rerio), golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas), roach (Rutilus rutilus), guppy (Lebistes reticulatus), pumpkinseed (Lepsomis gibbosus), northern pike (Esox lucius), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides) and white sucker (Catostomus commersonii) [55,[73], [74], [75]].",

Other lesions may include degenerated gill lamellae, oedematous internal organs, swollen and coarse-textured spleen, hepatic necrosis, enteritis, and pericarditis [75,77]. The histological changes associated with hepatopancreas may range from perivasculitis to panvasculitis with a higher degree of oedematization and loss of structure of blood vessels walls. The hepatopancreas parenchyma show hyperaemia, multifocal necrosis and adipose degeneration [77], whilst the spleen is often hyperaemic, showing a co-significant hyperplasia of the reticuloendothelium [55]. Multifocal necrosis and non-purulent inflammation often occur in the pancreas of affected fish, and the heart shows pericarditis and discontinuous myodegeneration [75]. The visceral and parietal serosa of the peritoneum show peritonitis. In the intestine, perivasculitis with subsequent atrophy of the villi is often observed [55,75]. The epithelial layer of the swim bladder changes into a discontinuous multilayer and hemorrhages are commonly observed in the submucosa [55].",

            "text": "As SVCV has a significant impact on carp aquaculture, its rapid detection and identification are crucial for effective control of the disease. Conventional serological techniques include the virus neutralisation test, immunoperoxidase assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay and ELISA. However, these techniques are laborious and time consuming [[78], [79], [80], [81]]. Moreover, the indirect immunofluorescence assay and ELISA appear to cross-react with other rhabdoviruses [80], leading to possible false-positive diagnoses. mAbs are also useful tools for detecting SVCV and studying the function of virus-specific proteins [82,83]. Recently, a single-chain fragment variable antibody against SVCV has been developed using phage display technology and employed for rapid detection of SVCV [84]. This antibody reacts specifically with SVCV, not cross-react with other viruses. Thus, this approach provides the basis for establishing simple and cost-effective way for the development of immunological detection assays for SVCV. Various PCR-based assays have also been used to detect SVCV owing to their high sensitivity. These include reverse transcription (RT)\u2014PCR combined with nested PCR [85], multiplex real-time quantitative RT-PCR [86] and one-step TaqMan real-time quantitative RT-PCR [87]. These assays have clearly improved the specificity and sensitivity of detection [88]. Although PCR is generally considered impractical for routine diagnostics in the field owing to the need for specialized instruments, skilled operators and isolation of RNA extracts, a recent report described an improved RT-PCR assay that is able to accurately detect SVCV directly from fish tissues, indicating the potential application of this technology for SVCV detection in infected fish in the field [89]. A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has been increasingly used for the detection of viruses [[90], [91], [92], [93]]. RT-LAMP is a simple and effective technique to rapidly amplify specific nucleic acid sequences under isothermal conditions. Moreover, it requires uncomplicated and inexpensive equipment easily manipulated at fish farms. This assay has been successfully applied for disease control in aquaculture [94,95]. Two studies have used RT-LAMP to detect SVCV based on nucleotide sequences of the G and M genes [96,97].",

In many high density grass carp pools, when the temperature of the water exceeds 24 \u00b0C, the virus rapidly proliferates and may result in serious dysfunction of the fish and death.

The genome of GCRV consists of 11 segments of dsRNA, encoding 12 proteins, including seven structural proteins and five non-structural proteins [104,105]. To date, more than thirty GCRV strains have been isolated from infected grass carp in global. Based on the difference in VP6 genome constitution, GCRV could be mainly clustered into three types, and the representative strains of three types are GCRV-873 (type I), GD108 (type II), and GCRV104 (type III), respectively [[104], [105], [106]]. As a consequence of the fast evolution, identities of amino acid sequences among types are less than 30% [[104], [105], [106]]. Among the three types, GCRV type II is considered to be the most pathogenic and prevalent type currently in China and may be closer to Orthoreovirus than any other known species of Aquareovirus showed by phylogenetic analysis [105,107].",

            "text": "At present, the antiviral immune responses against GCRV in grass carp are broadly researched. As a dsRNA virus, GCRV activates the similar PRR-PAMP recognition mechanism of innate immune system, being sensed by different receptors. Cytoplasm viral infection is primarily detected by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), a PRR family consisting of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetic and physiology 2 (LGP2) [108]. RIG-I preferentially binds to relatively short 5\u2032-phosphorylated dsRNA, while MDA5 binds to long dsRNA [109,110]. By GCRV or poly(I:C) challenge, mRNA level of RIG-I is up-regulated in CIK cells [111]. CPE assay and viral titter reveal the significant antiviral activity of full-length RIG-I in response to GCRV infection. Meanwhile, the expression levels of these three genes are significantly induced in spleen and hepatopancreas tissues after GCRV infection [[111], [112], [113], [114]]. LGP2 is found as a negative regulator for both RIG-I and MDA5 in resting state or early stage of GCRV infection. TLR signaling pathways also participate in the immune responses to GCRV infection. Up-regulations of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR19, TLR22 and other TLRs are observed post poly(I:C) or GCRV challenge [[115], [116], [117], [118], [119]]. The enhancement of NOD1 and NOD2 also occur in grass carp post GCRV infection [120,121]. All the members of HMGB family can respond to poly(I:C) and GCRV challenge in grass carp, delaying the CPE in CIK cells, meanwhile modulating RLR and TLR pathway genes [[122], [123], [124], [125], [126]]. Similar to mammals, fish IFN antiviral responses are initiated through the pattern recognition of virus component by TLRs and RLRs [127]. Although antiviral immune researches in teleost have achieved great progresses and several fish specific immune genes have been identified, studies on the regulation mechanisms of fish antiviral immune signaling pathways remain far behind those in mammals.",

Clinical signs are lethargy, skin hemorrhages with oedema in the underlying tissues, enophthalmos and pale swollen gills [5,129,137].

Sequencing the known DNA fragment encoding the core protein P4a from infected fish in different locations in Europe and Asia shows a 6%\u201310% of genetic diversity. It is classified into three genetic genogroups, called I, IIa and IIb [138,139]. Viruses from genogroup I usually present in farmed carp, while CEV from genogroup IIa mainly in diseased koi [133,138]. Infection experiments with both genogroups in koi and farmed carp confirmed biological differences between virus isolates [140]. The genetic diversity and the observed differences in biology reveal that the virus has been present in the European carp population for a prolonged period and infections are diagnosed until recently.",

Although the disease has been successfully transmitted, using filtrated suspensions of gill homogenates obtained from sick fish [5], the virus has yet to be isolated successfully and grown in cell culture. KSD diagnosis relies on detection of viral DNA by PCR [129,133,141]. In the present reports, the diagnosis relied on clinical findings is confirmed by molecular detection of an undefined segment of the viral genome. A nested PCR protocol is initially designed in Tokyo University of Fisheries [129], recently is modified in CEFAS-Weymouth Laboratory, England, to improve reliability of detection. The latter method of detection is also used for an extensive phylogenetic analysis to reveal the presence of two potential main viral lineages.",

Therefore, temperature control is an efficient method to fight against CyHV-1. Carp pox is an endemic chronic skin disease. In the early days after infection, the fish become thin and transparent. Smooth gray and white patchy growth organisms appear and is covered with a thin layer of white mucus. With the development of the disease, white spots gradually expand and thicken, the number gradually increases and interconnects into pieces. Smooth, creamy to brown appears as pink \u201cparaffin-like or glass-like\" pox and sores on blood vessels. These growth organisms are very tightly bound to the surface of infected fish body. The main component of the growth organisms is collagen fibers, which do not transfer but can naturally fall off and reappear in the original affected area. The back, head, fins and caudal peduncle are dense areas of pox and sores. The severely diseased fish is full of pox and sores, and the lesions often have bleeding. When the proliferation of organisms spreads to the bulk of the fish body, it will affect the growth and development of fish. The spine is damaged, the bones are softened, and the appetite diminishes, but generally no death.",

Until 1986, Chinese researchers exploited high-efficiency attenuated vaccine with good immune effect and long protection period. GCRV is detoxified by eucalyptus liquid and injected to immunize grass carp demonstrating long-term immunoprotection and up to 90% protection ratio [161]. The immunogenicity of VP5 and VP7, which are the major outer capsid protein of GCRV type I, are researched a lot to evaluate the potential of function as vaccine [192]. Recombinant of VP5 and VP7 vaccine is synergistically orally administrated to grass carp inducing good immunoprotection and less than 10% cumulative mortality [193]. Outer capsid protein VP4 in GCRV type II is also used to prepare GCRV vaccine. The immune protection assay shows that IgM and other antiviral immune responses are significantly triggered and 82% protection ratio is achieved [107]. Other researches on GCRV gene engineering vaccines mainly concentrate on the cell proliferation enhancing activity and immunoprotection of GCRV VP6 and VP7 recombinant plasmid [[194], [195], [196], [197]]. A GCRV VP6 DNA vaccine obtained by baculovirus expression system can achieve a protection ratio of 95% [198]. Using Bacillus subtilis as the carrier of GCRV VP4, the recombinant vaccine is orally immunized grass carp. Challenge experiment reveals that the oral recombinant subunit vaccine can protect 50%\u201360% grass carp from infection and generate immunity against GCRV [199]. GCRV VP5 expressed by Escherichia coli is proved to be relative to virus infection and have the potential to produce subunit vaccine [200]. The GCRV inactivated vaccine induces the IFN system of grass carp and strengthens the IgM expression continuously [201]. There are still hundreds of researches unlisted, working on the preparation of GCRV vaccine to improve the utility of vaccines to protect grass carp from GCRV infection.

Regardless of the obstacles of technologies and regulatory approvals [204], researches on DNA vaccines against SVCV has been steadily increasing in the last decade [[205], [206], [207]]. The initial SVCV DNA vaccine did not exhibit an expected effectiveness like other fish DNA vaccines against Novirhabdoviruses, including IHNV and VHSV [208]. Therefore, multiple trials have been conducted to develop an efficacious SVCV DNA vaccine. The G gene of SVCV encodes a surface glycoprotein which is considered to be a major antigen for inducing the primary host immune responses and is frequently used in DNA vaccine preparation [171,209]. Ten SVCV DNA vaccines carrying SVCV G gene are tested in carp [171]. The majority of treated groups show little protection, with relative survival ranging from 21% to 33%. The strongest protection (48% relative survival) is observed in a group injected with a combination of two constructs expressing the full-length G gene. However, the relative contribution of the two constructs to this protection rate is not determined [171]. The efficacy of another DNA vaccine expressing the G gene of a North American SVCV isolate is investigated in ornamental koi and goldfish [209]. In all trials, immunized fish demonstrate a strong protective response against SVCV, with relative survival ranging from 50% to 88% [209]. Vaccination with an oral or injection subunit vaccine based on the baculovirus recombinant expression of transmembrane SVCV-G protein in insect cells shows positive immune protection [210]. Taken together, these studies put forward the validation for the potential utilization of G gene for DNA vaccine as a prophylactic therapy against SVCV infection.",

            "text": "Although DNA vaccination via the parenteral route has been used as an efficient strategy to elicit antiviral immunity, it is not convenient for large-scale immunization due to the handling stress on fish, high labour and production cost [211]. Furthermore, there is limited scientific literature about the condition of DNA vaccines after injection into fish [212]. Intestine, gills, skin and other mucosal tissues of fish, are important for immune protection against pathogen invasion [213,214]. Activation of mucosal immunity prevents pathogen infections and replications in mucosa, whereas intramuscular vaccines fail to do this [214]. Oral vaccination is an effective way to induce mucosal immunity [215] and this strategy has shown a successful induction of the antiviral responses against viral diseases in different fish species [165]. Lactobacilli possess multiple properties to be suitable candidates for vaccine antigen delivery vectors [216]. Lactobacilli also play a non-specific immune adjuvant effect [217]. A genetically engineered Lactobacillus plantarum co-expressing SVCV G protein and KHV ORF81 protein is investigated for protective immunity in carp and koi through oral vaccination [218]. Immunized carp and koi show effective protection rates of 71% and 53%, respectively [218]. Moreover, immunized carp shows significantly elevated expression of IgM [218]. These results demonstrate that the recombinant L. plantarum is able to induce a protective immune response in fish against SVCV and KHV, suggesting a practical approach for large-scale control of cyprinid viral disease [218].",
