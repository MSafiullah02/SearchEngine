However, there are two main issues associated with filtration: (1) High aerosol removal efficiency is achieved only at the cost of high pressure drop, which is translated into high energy consumption for collective protection or high breathing resistance for individual protection. How to increase efficiency while maintaining low pressure drop is a critical challenge to filter development. (2) Collected biological agents may creep through the filter and reaerosolize. The reaerosolization may impose hazards to the person intended to protect. How to effectively retain the biological agents loaded on the filter, hence, is an important consideration (Ratnesar-Shumate et al., 2008; Rengasamy et al., 2004).",

A large surface-area-to-volume ratio of nanofiber can increase the probability of aerosol deposition on the fiber surface by diffusion and improve the filter efficiency (Ahn et al., 2006; Huang, Zhang, Kotaki, & Ramakrishna, 2003). Their smaller meshes can significantly increase the removal efficiency of submicrometer particles by direct interception (Podg\u00f3rski, Balazy, & Grado\u0144, 2006). Due to the slip on the nanofiber surface, the drag force on the nanofiber is smaller than in a non-slip flow, which translates into a lower pressure drop than conventional filters (Kosmider & Scott, 2002).",

Thus, an electropositive surface has the potential to have enhanced bioaerosol removal. This electrostatic attraction has been well demonstrated in aqueous environment. For example, iron oxyhydroxide floc particles have been investigated for adsorbing negatively charged MS2 viruses in water (Zhu, Clifford, & Chellam, 2005). Coating of sand and granular activated carbon with iron aluminum hydroxide increased the zeta potential and therefore improved virus removal (Scott et al., 2002).

Although there has been no assessment in the aerosol phase yet, its feature is expected to have enhanced bioaerosol collection and retention efficiency that utilizes the above addressed advantages: large surface-area-to-volume ratio, lower pressure drop and higher surface charge density. The objective of this study was therefore to evaluate the performance of the alumina nanofilter for removal and retention of viral aerosols. Experiments were conducted to assess the filter's physical removal efficiency (PRE), viable removal efficiency (VRE), extracted fraction (EF) and filter quality (q\nF). Three conventional filters (two glass fiber filters and one PTFE filter) were also tested for comparison. In addition, the nanofiber filter was examined in three different relative humidities (RHs) to determine its response to different environmental conditions.",

The bioaerosol was generated by a six-jet Collison nebulizer (Model CN25, BGI Inc., Waltham, MA) and passed through a dilution drier to remove the moisture. The virus concentration in the nebulizer was around 107\n PFU/mL and was prepared by diluting 0.1 mL of virus stock suspension in 50 mL of sterile DI water. The corresponding MS2 aerosol concentration was approximately 4000 PFU/L. The temperature and humidity of the air stream were measured by a thermometer and a RH meter (Model HX94C, OMEGA Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT), respectively. The airflow was then divided into two parallel streams. One stream that contained the test filter was designed for experimental collection while the other, which had no test filter, served as the control. The bioaerosol was collected by a biosampler (SKC Inc., Eighty-Four, PA) that had 15 mL of phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as collection liquid. MS2 collected in the biosampler was then enumerated following the procedures in Adams (1959) and plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 18 h. The experiment was conducted at 22\u00b12 \u00b0C and 50\u00b15% RH for 30-min intervals, and the face velocity of filtration was 26.0 cm/s. In addition, the nanofiber filter was tested in three RHs (35%, 50% and 75%) to determine its response to different environmental conditions. RH was regulated by controlling the ratio of dry cylinder air to the nebulizer flow. The pressure drop of the test filter was measured using a pressure gauge (2010AV C, Dwyer Instruments, Michigan City, IN).",

(1) based on the SMPS measurements. It should be noted that the freeze-dried MS2 from ATCC contains non-MS2 content, e.g. protein. Hence, the SMPS was measuring particles containing MS2 virons rather than purely MS2 virons.",

This phenomenon indicates that viruses were effectively retained in the nanofiber filter, due to electrostatic attraction between the electropositive fiber surface and electronegative MS2 particles. In contrast, the EFs of the other three filters were all greater than one. Theoretically, the EF should be less than one. However, the feed MS2 concentration determined by the biosampler collection was an underestimate because the biosampler had low collection efficiency for nanometer particles (<10% for 30\u2013100 nm; Hogan et al., 2005). With effective extraction, the EF therefore can be great than one.

On the other hand, the zeta potential of nanofiber media is +50 mV at pH 7 (Tepper & Kaledin, 2007). To further verify the electrostatic attraction, experiments were carried out with four fresh filters added to a suspension of known MS2 concentration (\u223c107\n PFU/mL) and the suspension was vortexed for up to 10 min. The results are shown in Fig. 4\n. The infectivity of MS2 on the nanofiber filter decreased dramatically with an increase in vortexing time.

Apparently, the performance of the nanofiber was not affected by RH change. It has been reported that high RHs decrease the removal efficiencies of electret filters (Motyl & Lowkis, 2006; Moyer & Stevens, 1989; Raynor & Chae, 2004; Yang et al., 2007) due to the reduction of charges within the filter. For non-electret filters that rely on mechanical removal mechanisms, RH imposes no significant effect on the removal (Huang & Yang, 2006; Kim, Bao, Okuyama, Shimada, & Niinuma, 2006). Wang and Brion (2007) showed that glass microfiber filter had similar performance at 23% and 50% RHs after the filter had reached a steady-state condition. Compared to electrets where the charge is induced during manufacture, the nanofiber's charge is intrinsic in the way the alumina is formed. Hence, the charge is not water sensitive and is retained in bulk water.",

It presented lower PRE and VRE than conventional HEPA filters, but its pressure drop was much lower due to smaller drag force on the nanofiber surface. Hence, the nanofiber filter presented the best filter quality. The EF of nanofiber filter was three orders lower than the HEPA filters, demonstrating that viruses were effectively retained in the nanofiber filter due to electrostatic attraction. While the performance of conventional electret filters decreases at higher RHs, different RHs imposed no effects on the nanofiber filter's ability to remove aerosol.",
