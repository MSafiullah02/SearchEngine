Since these cellular and tissue reactions are largely independent of the specific type of insults, they are, therefore, non-specific. The tissue reactions are to be differentiated according to their specific pathogenetic mechanisms, though these mechanisms as well as the phenomena are overlapping as demonstrated in Fig. 4 .1; brain ischemia as a type of metabolic disturbance, edema, intracranial pressure, necrosis, herniation and inflammation are influencing themselves and are dependent on each other. Some will be mentioned again in later chapters as viewed from different forensic aspects; therefore, a certain redundancy is unavoidable. Immediately following, we offer a survey of the individual types of reaction and their fundamental pathophysiological principles and morphology.",

The consequent pression of the brain against the inelastic dura mater (Fig. 4 .2) and the skull can lead to a lethal series of complications in clinical neurology. The following remarks are based largely on Ironside and Pickard (2002) . Brain volume depends on the following factors: 1. Water content (cerebral hydration). The brain has a normal water content of about 75%. A disturbance of the blood\u2212brain barrier (BBB) can lead to an increase in the fluid content, with a consequent increase in brain volume. 2.

In humans a variety of factors act in concert after the incidence of severe brain injury.

A reactive hyperemia is an additional factor and may be the mechanism underlying mechanical/ischemic brain injury (Seida et al. 1989 ).

The papilledema is not a direct result of the rise in water content, but the consequence of an accumulation of axoplasm in the optic papilla secondary to the blockade of axoplasmic flow from ganglion cells along the optic nerve. Papilledema is a common symptom of chronic intracranial hypertension. It is not, however, a common feature of MBI (Selhorst et al. 1985) , and its absence does not necessarily mean that ICP is normal.

Raised ICP was found in more than 70% of cases in a more detailed prospective study of elevated ICP in victims with severe head injury by Marmarou and colleagues (1991) . Jones and colleagues (1994) found elevated ICP in more than 80% of 74 brain injury patients (54 severe, 17 moderate and 3 minor) undergoing artificial ventilation with ICP monitoring. These findings indicate that intracranial hypertension is a common event, especially in comatose patients. Certain features detected by CCT are consistently associated with elevated ICP. Loss of the images of the third ventricle and perimesencephalic CSF cisterns, and dilatation of the lateral ventricle contralateral to a mass lesion, as well as the absence of these features are no guarantee that ICP will remain normal (Teasdale et al. 1984; O'Sullivan et al. 1994) .",

Among the possible causes are liver failure (hepatic coma), intracranial hemorrhage (subarachnoid and intracerebral), post-hypoxemic states (cardiorespiratory arrest, near drowning), infection (meningitis, abscess, and encephalitis), as well as various other types of inflammation and intoxication. Adams and Graham (1976) published neuropathological criteria for determining at autopsy whether ICP in victims of brain injury was elevated during life. The same team (Graham et al. 1987 ) compared the nature of the brain damage in patients with and without elevated ICP after suffering a non-missile brain injury who had survived long enough to receive treatment in a neurosurgical unit. Pressure necrosis of the parahippocampal gyrus, an indicator of high supratentorial ICP and tentorial herniation, was present in twothirds of the 434 patients in their most recent study. It was closely associated with skull fracture, brain swelling, diffuse axonal injury, hypoxic brain damage, and extensive supratentorial hematoma. The brain stem was damaged in 68% of victims with pressure necrosis, the anterior lobe of pituitary was necrotic in 45%, and there was hemorrhagic infarction in the distribution of the posterior cerebral artery in 36%. Klatzo (1967) distinguishes two types of edema: vasogenic edema and cytotoxic edema (Table 4 .1). This distinction continues to be of both theoretical and practical value (cf. Kimelberg 1995a, b; Mendelow et al. 2000) .",

The intercellular junctions are most conspicuous near the luminal surface where the cell membranes fuse. A basement membrane in contact with astrocytic foot processes surrounds the endothelial cells. Pericytes are enclosed by an envelope of the perivascular basement membrane, which splits to enclose the pericyte. Brain capillaries are almost totally invested by astrocytic processes. Astrocytes exert inductive actions during development and are thereby largely responsible for the special attributes exhibited by endothelial cells, such as the presence of tight junctions between the cells (Abbott et al. 1992) .

Anoxia (complete lack of oxygen), by contrast, results in a rapid rise in BBB permeability that becomes irreversible after just a few minutes (pp. 280 ff). If anoxia acts in combination with complete ischemia secondary to ligation of both common carotid and subclavian arteries, the BBB can retain its impermeability for as long as 3 h (Broman 1949; Blank and Kirshner 1977) . Incomplete ischemia, however, will rapidly and completely break down the BBB (Bakay and Lee 1965) . Kimelberg and colleagues (1997) could demonstrate the potential toxic mechanisms of this type of edema on neurons. They describe a primary cytotoxic effect on astrocytes that induces astrocytic swelling. This swelling in turn leads to the release of excitatory amino acids such as glutamate, whose levels increase in extracellular spaces following the incidence of MBI (Kanthan and Shuaib 1995) . A rise in extracellular glutamate levels causes cell death due to an influx of Ca 2+ via the neurons' activated ionotropic glutamate receptors (Choi and Rothman 1990) .",

The accumulation of plasma proteins within neurons and microglia in combination with cytochrome-C release by astrocytes can lead to DNA fragmentation and cell death (Matz et al. 2001 ). Klatzo's (1967) classification of brain edema has proved to be a useful aid in distinguishing between various pathogenetic mechanisms and their sequelae.

In this manner cellular (cytotoxic) edema can be differentiated from extracellular (vasogenic) edema and a correlation made with the severity of injury and consequent deficit. Because DW-MRI (see also Mendelow et al. 2000) enables edema types to be determined intra vitam under clinical conditions, current classifications of edema types could be revised in light of new findings. However, we should remember that all edema ultimately arises from the blood.

A rise in ICP leads not only to compression of the brain, but to diminished CSF volume, shifting, and herniation, as well as to secondary complications such as ischemia and hemorrhage. If not treated, ICP can rapidly progress to death due to brain stem compression secondary to cerebellar or uncal herniation (Meyer 1920) . Focal expanding mass lesions must be distinguished from diffuse space-occupying processes. \u25ac Diffuse brain lesions such as inflammation, bilateral intracranial hemorrhage, total brain ischemia (cardiac arrest) or intoxication are macroscopically characterized ( Fig. 4 .2) by a tension of the dura, gyral flattening, and by narrow ventricles that are symmetrically compressed. No lateral shift of midline structures is seen, but rather central herniation of the diencephalon (centrencephalic herniation) and by cerebellar tonsillar herniation and compression of the medulla oblongata. Bilateral herniation may occur and various types of herniation result from caudal displacement of the brain parenchyma (for types of herniation, see below). \u25ac Focal intracranial processes such as abscess, tumor, infarction or subdural hemorrhage ( Fig. 4 .8a, b) are also capable of inducing a life-threatening homolateral rise in ICP. Because they allow time for intrinsic compensatory mechanisms to operate, particularly reduced CSF volume, slowly expanding focal lesions are less likely to cause an early increase in ICP and brain shift. However, the distortion and herniation of the brain in such cases can be considerable. Rapidly expanding focal lesions, by contrast, are more likely to produce an immediately elevated ICP. Brain death often supervenes in such cases before much distortion or herniation can occur.",

A MBI-induced perifocal edema, for example that arises in the context of polytrauma-induced shock, can produce greenish discoloration of the perifocal edema as a consequence of an accompanying hepatic insufficiency, which can have an additional neurotoxicologic effect on the neurons. \u25ac The status of the BBB may well be age dependent, its postnatal status differing from that of adults. Blood group incompatibility between mother and child during pregnancy or after birth can cause bilirubin encephalopathy (see pp. 452 ff). The BBB appears to be less permeable in the elderly. \u25ac A cytotoxic effect can be mediated by alcohol in MBIs with consequent loss of neurons. Alcohol lowers cerebral perfusion pressure (CBF) and depresses ventilation. It diminishes respiratory drive in response to elevated PaCO 2 levels. Ethanol-induced respiratory depression and hypotension can increase the morbidity and mortality associated with brain injury. The theoretical considerations of Kimelberg et al. (1997) appear to contradict these empirical findings, arguing rather that alcohol inhibits both the excitotoxin receptor function of neurons (Simson et al. 1991) and the influx of Ca 2+ via NMDA receptor ion channels.",

CSF is absorbed by the arachnoid villi, which do not fully develop until adolescence or young adulthood (Grassman and Potts 1974) . In fetuses and infants, CSF is absorbed mainly through nerve roots and periventricular and arachnoid veins.",

Around the necrotic area, vessels are distended and release fluid into the infarcted tissue and surrounding tissue by way of a vascular network (perifocal edema). Neurons become thorny and severely shrunken within 12\u221236 h, with darkly staining incrustation of their pericellular structures. A survival time of 12 h leads to homogenization of the cytoplasm and nuclear and cytoplasmic pallor. Between 36 h and 48 h, the neurons disappear except for the nuclei (see Fig. 4.14c) .",

Within gray matter the outlines of dead neurons are recognizable, their cytoplasm is intensely eosinophilic and usually contains numerous, often large, vacuoles, and the nucleus stains poorly with hematoxylin. This picture, which is recognizable within the first 4\u22126 h, is followed by decreasing stainability of nucleus and cytoplasm until a barely recognizable ghost cell is all that re-mains. Acute and enduring deprivation of blood supply causes necrosis of cells and tissue components, the lesion remaining in a state of \"coagulation\" for a prolonged period. The cells appear only as shadows and the necrotic tissue persists within the brain as a foreign body and sometimes becomes encapsulated in mesenchymal tissue. The pathogenesis of this rare type of necrosis is still unknown (Escol\u00e1 and Hager 1963; Cervos-Navarro and Ferszt 1977) . ",

Apoptosis is the programmed death of a cell as regulated by specific death genes (for review see Clarke 1998 ). It initiates a delayed secondary death of neurons in response to environmental changes, deficient metabolic and trophic supply, and changed gene transcription. During apoptosis, the integrity of mitochondria is compromised and various pro-apoptotic proteins are released into the cytoplasm. This results in activation of caspases, proteases that orchestrate the death of the cell (Waterhouse 2003). Apoptosis requires active protein synthesis (McIntosh et al. 1998; Raghupathi et al. 2000) . A single cell can undergo a switch between the two types of cell death based on several pathways (McConkey 1998; Fiskum et al. 1999 ; see also Leist et al. 1990 ) (for further informations, see p. 620).",

A review by Rosenblum (1997) includes a comparison of various hypotheses regarding the underlying causes of \"delayed\" neuronal death, among them excitotoxicity, calcium, and apoptosis. Rubin (1997) and Abe (1999) review the phenomenon of neuronal apoptosis as it appears in various neurological diseases. Astrup et al. (1981) first defined the ischemic penumbra as brain tissue perfused at a level within the thresholds of functional impairment and morphologic integrity, which has the capacity to recover if perfusion is improved. Because tolerance of tissue to ischemic damage is dependent on residual flow and duration of flow disturbance (Heiss and Rosner 1983) , the ischemic penumbra is a dynamic process; it exists for a short period even in the center of ischemia, from which the conversion into irreversible necrosis propagates over time to the neighboring tissue. Focal ischemia results in necrosis at the infarct core and activation of complex signal pathways for cell death and cell survival in the penumbra. Increased expression of caspase-1, -3, -8, and -9, and of cleaved caspase-8 has been observed in the penumbra (for details, see Ferrer and Planas 2003) . But for a limited time interval, penumbral tissue has the potential for recovery and, therefore, is the target for interventional therapy in acute ischemic stroke (time window, Heiss 2000).",

Abnormalities in dendritic spines have been report- Fig. 4 .21a\u2212f.

Li et al. (1997) showed that expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in perikaryons and dendrites is a sensitive marker of dendritic lesions in spinal cord trauma (Fig. 3.2b ; see also Chap. 10 \u2212 pp. 226 f). As early as 4 h after moderate or severe compression of the spinal cord, loss of MAP2 immunoreactivity in dendrites and nerve cell bodies became evident in the injured segment. This phenomenon continued for the duration of the 9-day experimental period. How much MAP2 immunoreactivity is lost depends on how hard the cord is impacted (Li et al. 1995) . The loss of immunoreactivity may result from an (impact-induced) influx of calcium, activating calcium-dependent proteolytic enzymes capable of degrading MAP2 (Inuzuka et al. 1990 ). The same phenomena may be observed as a result of hypoxic lesions in the hippocampal area ( Fig. 4.21a, b) .",

The molecular events involving sodium channels and the Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger lead to an increase in intracellular calcium, which can provoke axonal degeneration. Axonal injury of myelinated axons is always accompanied by a demyelinating process, i.e., a loss of myelin, which will be eliminated by mononuclear phagocytes (see: Fig. 9.15b) . The sequelae will be a glial scar lacking myelin as demonstrable by Luxol fast blue stain (Fig. 4.22a) or by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against myelin basic protein ( Fig. 4.22b, c) .",

Axonal and myelin degeneration follow a time course described in detail by Brodal (1982) (see also p. 242).",

This retrograde alteration is characterized by rounding of the neuronal contours, swelling of the neuronal cytoplasm, and a decline in the number of Nissl bodies at the center of the cytoplasm (central chromatolysis \u2212 see Fig. 3 .1c). The nucleus becomes slightly deformed and is displaced to the periphery of the perikaryon. These changes correspond to the changed or increased neuronal gene expression after axotomy (Graeber et al. 2002) . Axotomy is followed in hours by rapid upregulation of the immediate early genes, such as cfos, c-jun, jun-B (Haas et al. 1993) , in association with the upregulation of heat shock proteins (Kalmar et al. 2002) . The one constant change associated with acute retrograde changes may be chromatolysis. These changes are sometimes accompanied by local proliferation of satellite glial cells whose time course has also been described by Brodal (1982) (see also pp. 242 and 304 f).",

Although the CNS has little innate capacity for repair, this capacity does exist for the peripheral nervous system.

These authors also identified the protein (Nogo) of a previously unknown gene that encodes the inhibitory myelin protein in rats and humans. The myelin-derived axon outgrowth inhibitor Nogo protein binds to an axonal Nogo-66 receptor and at least accounts for the lack of CNS repair (Li and Strittmatter 2003; McGee and Strittmatter 2003) . It remains unclear, however, what effect other factors may have, whether negative (e.g., the release by neurons of large quantities of glutamate following the incidence of spinal cord injury), or positive [e.g., release of tissue growth factors (Ramer et al. 2000) and cytokines, or induction of the macrophage scavenger function (see also Schwab 2000) ].",

Adult neurogenesis could be demonstrated in the subgranular and subventricular zones of the hippocampus (Kempermann et al. 1998; Cameron and McKay 1999) and the olfactory bulb (Craig et al. 1999 ). These are the only zones where differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons is known to take place in the intact adult CNS (Reilly 2002) . Because this process does not occur in the adult spinal cord, Svendsen (2002) postulates that the growth of neurites can only be stimulated by newly regenerated astrocytes. Additional findings suggest that adult neurogenesis is actively regulated in large part by astrocytes (Reilly 2002; Song et al. 2002) . Gage (1998) and colleagues (Kempermann et al. 1998) were able to show that exposure to an environmental challenge evokes much greater neurogenesis in old than in young animals. More recent data suggest that the old brain reacts quickly with a neurogenic response to functional challenges, a type of cellular plasticity associated with the continued sensory stimulation and activity of the aging brain (Kempermann et al. 2002; McKhan 2002) .",

Fontana et al. (1982) were the first to point out that cytokines such as interferon\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) are able to stimulate astrocytes to express MHC class II to secrete cytokines (IL-1, IL-3, TNF-\u03b1), and to present antigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP) to specific T-cell lines (Fontana et al. 1982 (Fontana et al. , 1984 Massa et al. 1987) . Frei et al. (1987) focused on microglia and found that they too could respond to IFN-\u03b3 by upregulating MHC-II. If IFN-\u03b3 or IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 are introduced directly into the CNS, there is independent, progressive upregulation of both MHC classes and of adhesion molecules, such as the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which are expressed first by perivascular macrophages (Hickey and Kimura 1988) , subsequently by microglia and macrophages throughout the CNS, and finally by astrocytes (Massa et al. 1986 ). Experimental induction of autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) revealed that perivascular macrophages are the chief presenters of CNS antigens to circulating T-cells (Hickey and Kimura 1988) .",

Inflammation undoubtedly serves primarily as a host defense mechanism in peripheral tissue, facilitating essential repair processes by altering local blood flow in the injured tissue, with accumulation of fluid and specialized cells.

CNS antigen presentation according to Hart and Fabry (1995) occurs outside and inside the CNS, with the BBB playing a major role in the regulation of CNS immune function. Parsons and Hunter (1999) showed that the early events leading to T-cell activation by antigenpresenting cells result from MHC binding. Co-stimulatory molecules then bind to the antigen, presenting cell\u2212T-cell complexes for further development of the cascade. MHC is expressed not only on astrocytes and microglia, but under certain conditions also on neurons and oligodendrocytes (Sedgwick and Hickey 1997) . MHC II antigens are also expressed under normal conditions in a population of macrophages inhibiting the perivascular space, subarachnoid space, and choroid plexus. This expression may indicate that these cells perform a modulatory function at the blood/CSF interface (Matyszak et al. 1992) . Under highly specific circumstances, physiological response mechanisms resembling those at the periphery also appear to take place in the brain.",

During emigration, i.e., extravasation, leukocytes initially come into loose contact with the walls of vessels of the microcirculation via selectin molecules or lectins, producing a rolling motion along the vessel wall (McEver 1994) .

In areas of CNS inflammation they are readily upregulated on endothelial cells and astrocytes (Sobel et al. 1990) , which stimulates recruitment of neutrophils to the site of injury. Such neutrophil emigration can be experimentally induced by extravasal injection of cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 (Bernardes-Silva et al. 2001 ) or TNF-\u03b1 (Schmid-Sch\u00f6nbein et al. 1999 .",

Increase in vascular permeability is caused by the release of free radicals and lysosomal enzymes, giving rise to edema (Weiss 1989) . Despite mechanisms evolved to restrict entry of neutrophils into the brain parenchyma, neutrophil recruitment is clearly a feature of acute brain injury, such as that caused by stroke or mechanical trauma. Numerous studies employing a transient or permanent model of focal ischemia in rats and mice have demonstrated that cerebral tissue injury is lessened by neutrophil depletion (Jean et al. 1998) . A correlation between the development of cerebral edema and neutrophil recruitment has also been shown in models of MBI (Schoettle et al. 1990 ). This deleterious effect of neutrophil recruitment contrasts with their beneficial function and phagocytic ability as scavenger cells in cases of bacterial inflammation and of particular importance in cases of sterile inflammation.",

It remains above baseline, however, for up to 5 days (Barone 1999) . Neuronal cells in and around the ischemic tissue acutely express TNF-\u03b1 in a so-called penumbra, but it also turns up several days later in macrophages in the infarcted tissue. TNF-\u03b1 triggers adhesion molecule expression on activated glial cells and the endothelium, in this manner regulating gliosis, tissue remolding, and scar formation. IL-1 levels rise before and during glial activation and neuronal damage (Rothwell et al. 1999 ).",

Blood-borne dissemination of virus from the primary infection site to other organs is restricted by circulating antibodies, IgG or IgM. Antibodies in tissue spaces can stop the spread of infection from one cell to another by neutralizing extracellular viruses. However, viruses able to fuse cell membranes, such as measles or herpes viruses, can elude this mechanism without ever being exposed to antibody. Viruses can be inactivated by antibodies in a variety of ways. Antibodies can assist phagocytosis by coating the surface of the virion, or they may thwart attachment of the virus to specific receptors on vulnerable cells, or in the case of enveloped viruses they may promote viral lysis via attachment and activation of complement. In the absence of antibody, direct viral lysis can also be produced by complement alone.",

This age group also regularly shows a superficial granule layer of the cerebellar cortex composed of germinal cells (matrix cells). These usually disappear some time between the second and fourth years of life. In cases of sudden death with brief agony or if tissues have been poorly fixed (Hirano 1981) , extensive acute swelling of oligodendroglia is common. In addition, a generalized swelling and clasmatodendrosis of astrocytes is often seen. These changes are rather slight compared to the neuronal changes. They must also be regarded as non-specific and do not constitute markers of edema. Lindenberg (1982) points out that the state of the brain before circulatory arrest also plays a role. If the agony was brief (healthy person who died within minutes), neurons and glial cells may show marked postmortem ischemic cell injury (vacuolation, homogenization, acute shrinkage associated with nuclear changes).

It is further known that the enzyme activity of cells and tissue depends in large part on the length of the postmortem interval (for a survey of findings prior to 1980 see Oehmichen 1980) . Numerous variables are known to affect the immunoreactivity of cells and tissue in the antigen\u2212antibody reaction for immunohistological demonstration of epitopes (Grizzle et al. 2001 ).
