Healthcare administrators and emergency management must attempt to calculate needs based on projected illnesses and existing capacities. Based on a 40% prevalence of COVID-19 in the United States during the pandemic, 100 million people infected, about 21 million will be hospitalized, with about 4.5 million of them needing intensive care. While healthcare systems across the country have varying abilities to accommodate this patient load, a six-month epidemic will result in filling 275% of the potentially available capacity of inpatient beds and >500% of the intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity. If the course is flattened to 12 months, the need for hospital beds would be 137% and the ICU beds 254% of capacity.1 Either situation will require a significant increase in our physician, nurse, and associated workforce.",

While in the UK more than 24,000 final-year student nurses and doctors are starting to work in the NHS,29 US healthcare students have mostly been pulled off clinical rotations.33 New York University Medical School offered its senior medical students who meet all graduation and screening requirements the voluntary opportunity to graduate three months early so they can help relieve the strain on frontline clinicians. The plan is to have them immediately begin working as paid interns in their hospital\u2019s internal medicine and emergency departments, although they do not have to continue in those specialties.34 Medical schools across the country have followed their lead. Many health professions students are assisting their colleagues in non-clinical ways, including staffing community and clinic information lines, helping to procure additional personal protective equipment, babysitting, grocery shopping, and doing other necessary chores for hospital workers, and volunteering on time-sensitive COVID-19 laboratory projects.30,35",
