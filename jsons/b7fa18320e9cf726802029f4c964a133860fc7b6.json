As a group, transplant patients present a real challenge for initial diagnosis of infection partly due to lowered or absent markers of inflammation [2] . Traditionally, these infections have been diagnosed using bacterial, fungal, and viral culture as well as a variety of immunological assays. These methods still remain the standard of care for diagnosis of most infections. However, a series of advanced detection techniques led by nucleic acid amplification have now become prominent in most clinical microbiology laboratories, and novel proteomic assays are currently being added in the list of diagnostic tools available for infectious pathogen detection and identification.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 204, "end": 207, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 208, "end": 210, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 361, "end": 364, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The goal of this chapter is to review traditional and molecular methods used for the diagnosis of infectious diseases in transplants patients and discuss novel methodologies currently in development and their potential impact on clinical decisions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Culture remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of most infectious diseases including those caused by bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi [3, 4] . One of the advantages of culture is that it does not require a priori knowledge of the specific pathogen responsible for the infection as it casts a wide search net by using multiple growth media and incubation conditions. For example, diarrhea and vomiting are common symptoms in transplant patients, and determining the infectious cause for those symptoms can be challenging due to confounding factors such as intestinal graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD) in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients, neutropenic enterocolitis, and immunosuppressive drugs [5] . A request for a bacterial stool culture will allow detection of the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, namely, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Campylobacter species, and E. coli O157 with a recovery rate ranging from 0.2% to 2.4% [3, [6] [7] [8] . In addition, any other bacterial organisms growing on the culture media, with potential for causing gastrointestinal symptoms, will be detected and reported. However, culture of certain organisms, including C. difficile, the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea in hospitalized patients, requires special culture media and setup and has been replaced in most part by nonculture-based methods. Similarly, viral causes of diarrhea including cytomegalovirus (CMV), norovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, and other small round viruses are better detected by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) and antigen tests [9] [10] [11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 140, "end": 143, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 144, "end": 146, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 723, "end": 726, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 978, "end": 981, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 982, "end": 985, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 986, "end": 989, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 990, "end": 993, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1606, "end": 1609, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1610, "end": 1614, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1615, "end": 1619, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Culture-Based Assays"}, {"text": "The diagnostic yield of culture for various specimen types remains low.

The GM assay has been evaluated extensively in various patient populations with sensitivity ranging from 30% to 100% and specificity ranging from 38% to 98% in serum with greater utility in HSCT patients than in SOT recipients [46] . In a study by Jathavedam and colleagues, the GM assay was shown to have limited utility within the first 100 days after auto-SCT and therefore not useful for patient management decision [47] . In another study conducted in patients with hematologic malignancies, the sensitivity of the GM assay was 49% for invasive fungal infections caused by Aspergillus species other than A. fumigatus and only 13% for IFD caused by A. fumigatus [48] . Results of these various studies suggested that the performance of the GM assay depends on several factors including the infecting species of Aspergillus, the type of transplant populations, the frequency of testing, and the duration of antifungal therapy [45, 49] . The sensitivity of the GM assay in BAL of HSCT recipients and patients with hematological malignancies is higher than that reported for serum and ranges between 88% and 100% using the same optical density cutoff value used for serum [45, 50, 51] . In solid-organ transplant patients, the sensitivity and specificity of the GM assay in BAL ranged from 60% to 100% and 84-98%, respectively, depending on the optical density cutoff value used [50, [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . Thus, the GM assay in BAL is a useful additional test for diagnosing IFD. False-positive results were observed in patients receiving piperacillin, amoxicillin, or ticarcillin with or without a beta-lactamase inhibitor, in patients being administered electrolyte replacement fluids (i.e., PlasmaLyte), and in patients infected with molds other than Aspergillus for a low specificity and positive predictive value [45, 57] .

Today, real-time nucleic acid amplification methods are mainstream in most sections of clinical microbiology, and their impact on care of transplant patients is significant. Several real-time PCR laboratory-developed tests (LDT) as well as a few FDA-approved assays are used for the diagnosis of bacterial infections in transplant patients. Bacteria targeted for assays development have traditionally been those related to nosocomial infections. For example, until recently, most PCR assays for detection of C. difficile were LDT assays that resulted in an increased sensitivity and turnaround time for results [82] [83] [84] [85] . At the time of this chapter preparation, the FDA had cleared over eight molecular assays for the diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Similarly, rapid molecular assays have been developed for a variety of bacterial targets including difficult-to-culture or slow-growing organisms (i.e., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi), targeted diagnosis (i.e., group A Streptococcus in throat swabs), and nosocomial pathogens (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci) [80] . The turnaround time and identification of the most common Mycobacteria species were greatly improved with the introduction of nucleic acid hybridization probes in the laboratory. Nucleic acid hybridization probes are single-stranded or double-stranded DNA/RNA fragments complementary to a sequence in the target organisms and most commonly labeled with a fluorescent or chemiluminescent marker for detection [86] . Probes for same-day identification of M. tuberculosis complex, M. kansasii, M. avium complex, and M. gordonae from either solid or liquid cultures have been commercially available since the early 1990s (Gen-Probes, San Diego, CA). These probes show excellent sensitivity and specificity, although cross-reaction has been reported between M. tuberculosis complex and M. terrae [87] [88] [89] [90] .
