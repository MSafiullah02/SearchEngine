            "text": "The China-Africa partnership is one of the most important geopolitical and economic relationships of the 21st century that has ushered a new era of investment in mutual health development [1]. China has become the world\u2019s second-largest economy and offered Africa various based on win-win cooperation. Traditionally, China is willing to work together with Africa to achieve mutual benefits by taking advantage of its status as assistance-provider in tackling infectious diseases of poverty 2., 3.. Furthermore, since Africa is home to seven of world\u2019s ten fastest growing economies, Chinese investments in the health sector in the continent can produce substantial financial gains and generate invaluable public health commodities and other goods that are much needed 4., 5.. The need for an African Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was recognized at the African Union Special Summit on HIV and AIDS, TB and malaria held in Abuja, Nigeria, in July 2013. The Africa CDC has launched year with the establishment of an African Surveillance and Response Unit, which will include an Emergency Operations Center and exchanges on China\u2019s national disease surveillance and reporting system [4]. Currently, Africa continent is experiencing a rapid economic growth, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $ 2.4 trillion USD in 2013 and is estimated to increase to $ 3.3 trillion USD by 2020. Health-care spending rose from $ 28.4 billion USD in 2000 to $ 117 billion USD in 2012 across African countries 6., 7., 8.. The fact that Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 14% of the world\u2019s population and 24% of the global burden of infectious diseases caused by poverty, millions of people could be lifted out of poverty through bilateral trade and cooperation between China and Africa. Increasing and robust new commitments of governments, investments from international community and other public-private stakeholders on the national health budgets have promoted and actively supported the \u201cOne Health\u201d implementation policy and programs in African countries in achieving their health-related sustainable development goals (SDGs). Towards the goal of joint research and education development, the mix of Chinese \u201cOne Health\u201d programs and the African vulnerable groups will foster social cohesion in preparedness and response to emerging global challenges [9]. For instance, Chinese and African experts have initiated in revamping new approaches to global health political commitment of implementing universal health coverage, strengthening its primary healthcare system and increasing investment in public health multidisciplinary interventions to reduce the increasingly heavy burden caused by infectious diseases at global level 6., 8.. Disease outbreaks are increasing globally due to environmental degradation, climate change, population growth and increased cross-border movements [1].",

The interplay of public health, biosecurity and One Health approach provide immense opportunities for both local and international health actors to address the national/regional public health needs and differential vulnerabilities assessment towards evidence based multifaceted and inter-sectoral programs and interventions. For instance, two major outbreaks of Lassa fever (LF) occurred in 2016 in the two neighbouring West African countries of Nigeria and Benin Republic. Nigeria suffered a larger burden of LF in this recent outbreak and accounts for about 85% of all deaths recorded (a total of 585 suspected cases, 56 confirmed cases and 73 deaths recorded since disease onset in August 2015. In 2014, US CDC estimated the yearly number of LF cases to be between 300,000 to 500,000 resulting in about 5,000 deaths across West Africa. LF is endemic in most parts of West Africa with sporadic cases occurring in other African countries every year. Studies have predicted approximately 80% of Liberia and Sierra Leone, 40% of Nigeria, and 30% of Benin to be at risk of LF through spatial analysis. In Nigeria, approximately 4883 cases and 277 deaths have been reported from 2012 to date. Due to a paucity of data, the actual number of cases in other West African countries to date is still unknown. However, seroprevalence studies in the past have shown a prevalence of Lassa IgG antibodies in 8% to 52% of the general population in Sierra Leone and in Guinea, and as high as 25% to 55% among inhabitants of tropical rain forest and 29% to 40% in hospital staff of Gueckedou and Lola Prefectures in Guinea. Direct transmission from rodent to humans mainly occurs through inhalation of primary aerosols from infected rodent urine, ingestion of food contaminated with rodent excreta or by direct contact with broken skin. Regional and nosocomial outbreaks of LF are commonplace in LF endemic countries and played a major role in recent outbreak. In Nigeria, the 2016 LF outbreak has been estimated to have an overall case fatality rate of 48% and 60% in confirmed cases; the impact on healthcare workers due to inadequately equipped, weak preventive measure for hospital associated infections (HAI) and well trained staff and facilities with poor laboratory and clinical management practices were the main reasons for a dearth of data. While there is no known vaccine for LF, early supportive care and treatment with ribavirin. Prevention efforts include isolation of cases, implementing infection control measures such as barrier nursing supplies, rodent control and practicing adequate food hygiene (storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent\u2013proof containers) and personal hygiene. Although treatment for LF is available, early diagnosis, prevention and prompt management of infection are necessary (\nTable 1).",

Based on a unified and integrated plan, China and US government are willing to leverage their respective strengths to support the African Union in building this system, which will be the first regional disease surveillance system on the African continent from the Ebola crisis. It is important to strengthen disease surveillance and monitoring efforts at the regional level in providing technical expertise and response coordination in future health emergencies, address complex health challenges, and build needed capacity responses, responsible for disease surveillance, investigations, analysis, and reporting trends and anomalies.

In addition, leveraging on the unique \u201cOne Health\u201d approach to transform health care and health policy and to prioritize collaborative programs can be extended from infectious diseases to maternal and child health and health disparity in the poorest populations in Africa 1., 10., 11., 12.. Secondly, building regional surveillance systems is another way to enhance the local health system. The importance of implementing a local and national \u201cOne Health\u201d policy and programs holds tremendous prospects, such as co-tackling the epidemiological and environmental challenges, and accelerating in the transition from control to elimination of infectious diseases under China-Africa collaboration 5., 15.. Furthermore, it has potential to revolutionize national health systems, policies and strategic priorities and the patterns in health financing and resources allocation of African countries that require careful understanding of the local context of diverse stressors and drivers 21., 13.. These will continue to dominate the performance and effectiveness of \u201cOne Health\u201d in threats and epidemics prevention strategies and policies on healthcare and health outcomes. Thus, assessing health impact especially how greenhouse gas and ozone emissions, rising temperature and environmental pollution resulted in climate change impacts to health ecosystem, such as population movement, animal trading and ecology of vector-borne disease and ill health, aging, chronic disease, drug use and domestic violence, inequity and poverty [16]. Thirdly, improving the core capacities of international health regulations is the sustained efforts to improve the human welfare. For example, China\u2019s response impacting the global health fund (e.g., malaria, HIV/AIDS, schistosomiasis, Ebola, influenza, TB, hepatitis, etc.) has shown robust global health leadership engagement 1., 2., 3.. The leadership reflected in the strategic mobilization and investment of resources fostering more easily accessible, availability and cost effectiveness of prevention and treatment interventions to resources limited countries including African countries [1]. The growing mutual China-Africa win-win collaboration spans to technical expertise, technology transfer and capacity development using scientific and advanced methods to tackle the disease, and have enhanced their commitment to respect the dignity of the people such as Chinese Ebola outbreak emergency response in West Africa. Fourthly, enhancing the use and management of traditional medicines could improve the community involvement in health care and extend the trade among countries. So far, trade between China and Africa is projected to reach $ 385 million USD a year by 2015. Increasingly, embracing \u201cOne Health\u201d strategy to increase universal coverage of healthcare is significant as sharing China\u2019s rich expertise and lessons learnt in strengthening health systems and tackling public health burden both in China and Africa communities. Thus, Africa has the opportunity to improve capacity of community health workers to reach remotes rural communities living beyond the margins of traditional health care systems 5., 10..",

These projects and activities aim at tackling the persistent and growing burden of infectious diseases of poverty, maternal and child morbidity and mortality, and responding timely to the global health concerns and emergency response called on emerging threats and epidemics in the continent. Some examples of the landmark achievements include the China-Zanzibar and China-Tanzania projects on sharing Chinese lessons and experiences in infectious diseases to support schistosomiasis and malaria prevention and control in African countries respectively, as well as Chinese maternal-child heath safety and children nutrition, dissemination and transfer experiences in Ghana 9., 25., 26.. Furthermore, China-Comoros support to national malaria elimination that led to interruption of transmission and reducing in malaria mortality to zero in the last eight years in Comoros 8., 9., 10.. Likewise, understanding strategic public health financing and human resources systems capacity is necessary in promoting uptake and efficiency of Chinese global health initiatives and innovations in strengthening healthcare delivery system and quality outcomes in LMICs including Africa, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Latin American countries.

In addition to the mobile biosafety laboratory, China also built permanent and well-equipped public biosafety laboratory in Seirra Leone and DR Congo to improve the national capacity to detect, prevent and respond to future threats and epidemics. Over 30 batches of public health, clinical medicine and laboratory experts were dispatched in 11 African countries in scaling up public healthcare delivery capacity and training of health workers and communities in risk assessment, communication, and response measures in effective Ebola, malaria, schistosomiasis prevention and containment, amongst other shared responsibility and mutual commitment 1., 4., 8., 9., 25., 26., 27..",

Resolving the persistent and unprecedented rising of emerging and re-emerging epidemics, and new priorities of Ebola, Zika, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) requires collaborative and mutual cooperation with governments, bilateral and multilateral initiatives, including boosting private-public partnerships, regional and international organizations in achieving the global health security threat and agenda 2030 2., 3., 5., 6., 7.. For example, China has dispatched more than 1,000 medical experts to resist West Africa Ebola epidemics through contributions to coordinated international emergency response efforts that helped to contain Ebola virus transmission dynamics and spread that retrieved lives of over 12,200 people 1., 5., 6.. Similarly, Zika virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, and includes Africa subtype and Asia subtype. It is a mosquito-borne virus primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, sexual transmission; blood transmission and mother-to-fetus transmission have been also reported. Zika virus can go through blood-brain barrier and infect central nervous system. Symptoms are generally mild and self-limited, but recent evidence suggests a possible association between maternal Zika virus infection and adverse fetal outcomes, such as congenital microcephaly, as well as a possible association with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In absence of safe vaccine or effective antiviral Zika medication for prevention and control Zika virus infection, early laboratorial diagnosis includes nucleic acid detection, serological test, and isolation of virus and epidemiology and clinical risk assessment and syndromic surveillance is crucial1., 3., 13.. Nevertheless, there remains a need to build a platform with function of effective surveillance, recovery, preparedness, consultation and communication, and to share surveillance based on the principle of sincerity, real time problem-solving and results-giving, and good faith towards collaborative global health solutions 4., 14., 15., 16..",

Moreover, with improvement of targeted strategies to deal with emerging outbreaks and infectious diseases of poverty elimination, understanding human-animal interface with increasing urbanization, globalization of trade and travel are necessary. Hence, China-Africa \u201cOne Health\u201d strategy sustainable implementation and alignment with local and national priorities hold great promises. Integrating collaborative human-animal-environmental projects and programs have substantial prospects in increasing local and national food production and global food security 28., 29.. This is critical in averting or reducing the persistent malnutrition, under-nutrition and related health complications and diseases (e.g. malnutrition linked Kwashiorkor or rickets, obesity, typhoid, diarrhea, dysentery) resulted in children and youth developmental retardation, poor educational performance, poor quality of life and living including high DALY and low QALY short life expectancy, worsening the vicious cycle of poverty and premature death documented in Africa countries 4., 9., 11., 13., 14.. Similar high public health challenges and burden in Africa were recorded in China before 1980s, mainly in Chinese rural communities circumventing with the implementation of the Chinese rural cooperative medical insurance schemes. However, more investment is still needed in achieving food auto-sufficient and balanced food and nutrition/diet for all in both continents [15]. Developing and integrating climate changes resilience, mitigation and adaptation measures in allied health programs is vital in protection, conservation and management of the adverse socio-demographic, ecological, health and economic effects of greenhouse gas emissions and changes consequences, and in securing the future benefits of green and eco-friendly environment.",
