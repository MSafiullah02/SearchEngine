Emergency departments (EDs) are the principal portals of entry into healthcare systems, and the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is one way to further reduce the risks of infection transmission [2,3]. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-cov) outbreaks have recently raised concerns of airborne transmission in the healthcare settings [[4], [5], [6]]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the use of particulate filtering facepiece respirators such as N95 filtering facepiece respirator (N95 respirator) or their equivalent when HCWs treat patients with airborne infectious diseases, but facepiece respirators only work properly when the face seal is tight [1]. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a life-saving procedure that is frequently performed in the ED. Chest compressions, one of the main components of CPR, needs intense and dynamic movements. Previously published simulation studies showed that the N95 respirator did not provide adequate protection during chest compression [7].",

A PAPR is a battery-powered blower that provides clean air through a canister or cartridge with filter to the different type of hoods such as tight-fitting respirator, a loose-fitting hood, or a helmet. In the medical environment, loose-fitting PAPR is mainly used because it can cover the entire face including the eye and it also does not require a fit test [9,10].",

Since 2015, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has revised its guidelines for patients with suspected MERS to use PAPR during CPR [11]. However, there is insufficient evidence on whether loose-fitting PAPRs provides and maintains a protective effect for HCWs during CPR. In addition, because PAPR is a multi-piece equipment with external connections through an unfixed tube, there are concerns about the possibility of equipment problems such as tube disconnection and fan malfunction due to intense movements during chest compression. Finally, PAPR may affect the satisfaction and performance of participants who perform chest compression.",

This equipment was certificated by the British Standards Institution (BSI), 539745 CE. The PAPR includes a particle filter P3 to protect against particles, including highly toxic materials. During the simulation, we used a rechargeable battery (5.2 V, NiMH) that lasted 8 h when fully charged. The participants checked the operational state of the PAPR themselves including the filter's fitting status and flow test under supervision of the investigators. In order to pass the flow test, the ball in the cylinder had to rise above a specific line defined by the manufacturer. Only the device that passed the test was used for the simulation.

After completing the simulation, participants were asked about the degree of comfortability to don or doff, difficulty to breathe through the PAPR, obstruction of vision, interrupting communication, skin irritation, and interference with ability. The investigators asked the participants three questions to assess the difficulty in communication during the 2-min operation time. The investigators gave feedback to the participants in real time to maintain the participants' CPR quality during the chest compressions. Based on the above, the participants subjectively assessed the difficulty in communication or listening after the simulation.",

Performing chest compressions on a manikin lacks patient interaction. In addition, the participants only performed continuous chest compressions without ventilations. CPR is a complex intervention in the clinical setting. Several tasks are performed by HCWs in an uncontrolled and confusing environment. Interactions with other HCWs during chest compressions in a realistic situation may affect outcomes including device problems (i.e., tube disconnection or mechanical failures) and difficulties in communication. Second, we evaluated only one PAPR model and one-sized loose-fitting hood manufactured by one company. In particular, there was no consideration of each participant's face size. Therefore, there is a limit to generalizability of our results to other models. Third, we did not consider the infections associated with donning and doffing of PAPR and disinfection of equipment. Forth, we performed a flow test before the simulation, but the blower flow rate in hood was not measured in real time. Moreover, the filtration efficiency of PAPRs filter was not evaluated in this study. Finally, CPR quality may be affected by the use of PAPRs. However, our study aimed to assess the effect of PAPRs on respiratory protection during chest compressions and not on the quality of the chest compressions. Therefore, we provided feedback to each participant in real time to ensure high CPR quality to reflect real-world situations. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of PAPR use on the quality of chest compressions.",
