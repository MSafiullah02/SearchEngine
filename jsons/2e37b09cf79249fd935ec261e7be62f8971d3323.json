This complex was obtained by co-crystallization of M pro with HEAT (2-(((4hydroxyphenethyl)amino)methyl)-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one) in the framework of a large X-ray crystallographic screening project of M pro against a drug repurposing library, consisting of 5632 approved drugs or compounds in clinical phase trials. Further investigations showed that HEAT is cleaved by M pro in an E1cB-like reaction mechanism into 2-methylene-1-tetralone and tyramine. The catalytic Cys145 subsequently binds covalently in a Michael addition to the methylene carbon atom of 2-methylene-1-tetralone. According to this postulated model HEAT is acting in a pro-drug-like fashion. It is metabolized by M pro , followed by covalent binding of one metabolite to the active site. The structure of the covalent adduct elucidated in this study opens up a new path for developing non-peptidic inhibitors.",

            "text": "The pandemic disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is an international health challenge and there is an immediate need for the identification of drugs for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Infection of host cells critically depends on several molecular factors from both the host and virus (1, 2) . Coronaviruses are RNA-viruses with a genome of around 30 kbp. The viral gene essential for the replication of the virus is expressed as polyprotein that must be broken into functional subunits for replication and transcription activity (1) . This proteolytic cleavage is primarily accomplished by the main protease (M pro ), also known as the 3C-like protease 3CL pro . M pro cleaves the viral polyprotein at eleven sites. The core cleavage motif is Leu-Gln\uf0df(Ser/Ala/Gly) (1) . M pro possesses a chymotrypsin-like fold amended by a C-terminal helical domain and harbors a catalytic dyad comprising Cys145 and His41 (1) . The active site is located in a cleft between the two N-terminal domains of the three domain structure of the monomer, while the C-terminal helical domain is involved in regulation of dimerization of the enzyme with a dimerization constant of 2.5 \u00b5M (1) . Due to its central involvement in virus replication M pro is well established as a prime target for antiviral compounds that can tackle coronavirus infections (3) . Indeed first studies confirm the potential of targeting M pro for inhibition of virus replication (1, 2) .",

This compound collection is based on the BROAD institute repurposing library (5) . In contrast to crystallographic screening campaigns with small molecules (\"fragment screening\") (6), our library contains compounds that are chemically more complex and of larger molecular mass. As M pro crystals possess a low solvent content of only 38% (1) with narrow solvent channels that could impede larger molecules from diffusing into the active site in soaking experiments, we co-crystallized M pro with the individual compounds instead of soaking pre-grown M pro crystals in compoundcontaining solutions. Crystals typically appeared within 2 days and were then submitted to single crystal X-ray structure determination (see Methods). From the resulting X-ray structures, several compounds were identified in complex with M pro . Among these was BE-2254 (HEAT, 2-(((4-hydroxyphenethyl)amino)methyl)-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one), where a well resolved electron-density was observed in the active site of the M pro crystal structure. This electron-density can be well modeled as 2-methyl-1-tetralone (METT) covalently bound to the sulfur atom of Cys145, thereby blocking access to the active site of M pro and occupying the P1 site of the protease. 2-Methyl-1-tetralone is potentially a breakdown product of the parent compound HEAT included in the co-crystallization experiment.",

A closer view of the active site reveals clear unoccupied electron-density for a small molecule covalently bound to the catalytic Cys145 which could be well modeled as METT (figure 1B). The chemical structures of the parent compound HEAT and the observed cleavage product METT bound to M Pro are illustrated in figure 1C and D, respectively, clearly showing the relationship between the two molecules. This observation suggests METT to be a breakdown product of HEAT, with tyramine (TY) as the complementary product ( figure 1E ). To confirm the cleavage of HEAT by M pro and subsequent covalent binding of METT to M pro , native mass spectrometry (MS) experiments were performed (10) . In a control experiment without the addition of HEAT we observe a high intensity peak envelope corresponding to the expected mass of the M pro dimer (67,599 +/-5 Da, charge states +14 to +16). The monomer is also visible with lower intensity (33,795 +/-2 Da, charge states +9 to +11) (figure 2A). Next M pro was incubated with HEAT at a molar ratio of 1:10 (M pro :HEAT) overnight. After incubation of M pro with HEAT two additional peak envelopes can be observed in the high mass range (figure 2B). Their assigned masses correspond to the M pro dimer alone or plus one and two METT molecules (67,593/67,774/67,955 Da).

            "text": "To probe the chemical interaction between M pro and HEAT, CID-MS/MS was performed by separating a molecular ion precursor (+15, dimer) in the quadrupole of the mass spectrometer and triggering its dissociation in a collision cell (see Methods). The dimer dissociated into low-and high-charge monomeric molecular ions. METT was observed to still be bound to the highcharge ions (suppl. figure 1) . The ratio of the dissociated monomer in the unbound to bound state was roughly 5:4. The binding of the reactive group to the dissociated molecule indicates a strong interaction between M pro and METT, as would be expected for a covalent bond. Furthermore, only one METT per monomer is detected which suggests that the interaction is sitespecific. Understanding of the underlying reaction mechanism requires knowledge about the initial binding of HEAT to M pro which was not observed in the X-ray diffraction experiment. To obtain information on the initial binding state of HEAT to M pro , computational docking studies were employed using JAMDA and HYDE (11) (figure 3). We visually inspected multiple proposed noncovalent binding modes which might help to reveal the possible reaction mechanism. The keto form of HEAT (figure 3A) is found to occupy pockets P1 and P2 with a carbon-sulfur distance of 3.4 \u00c5. HEAT forms a hydrogen bond to His163 in the active site via the carbonyl oxygen atom, a weak hydrogen bond to Cys145 via its secondary amine, and a T-stacking interaction to His41. The enol form (figure 3B) seems to be more stably bound to the active site, forming not only the two aforementioned hydrogen bonds, but also a hydrogen bond to Cys44 via its phenol moiety. Additionally, a pi-pi stacking interaction between His41 and the phenol moiety can be observed in this predicted binding mode. Moreover, the carbon-sulfur distance of 3.5 \u00c5 for the enol form of HEAT to Cys145 is well within the acceptable range for covalent bond formation. This non-covalent binding mode corresponds well to the experimentally determined binding mode of METT which occupies the S1 pocket ( figure 3C) . Additionally, the leaving group of the molecule is situated in the S2 pocket and is engaged in a weak pi-pi stacking interaction with His41 and a weak hydrogen bond to Cys44. We hypothesize that HEAT initially binds non-covalently to the protease and is converted to the corresponding enol form prior to the formation of the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone. This process might be catalyzed by residues His163 and Cys145, which are engaged in hydrogen bonds to the product METT as well as the proposed non-covalently bound keto-and enol-form of HEAT. Due to the covalent binding to the active-site Cys145, we expected an inhibitory effect on the enzyme function and thus virus replication. ",

M pro is a cysteine protease possessing the conserved reactive center dyad Cys145 and His41, which together catalyze the sequence-specific hydrolysis of peptide bonds, vital for SARS-CoV-2 replication. We propose a similar mechanism for the cleavage of the drug HEAT, leading to a suicide reaction of the protease, which terminates in a covalent thioether bond between Cys145 and METT ( figure 4) . As initiation the tetralone carbonyl is activated by His163, forming an enol. The thiolate of Cys145 could serve as base, removing the hydrogen of the \u03b2-carbon and forming the enol. After enol-oxygen deprotonation by His163, an unimolecular conjugate base elimination (E1cB)-like mechanism expels the protonated tyramine amine, forming 2-methylen-1-tetralone in the active site. In a subsequent step this highly reactive intermediate reacts in a Michael addition, where the thiolate of Cys145 attacks the \uf061,\uf062-unsaturated 2methylen-1-tetralone, forming a thioether bond resulting in covalently bound METT. This final reaction state was confirmed by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.8 \u00c5. As evident in our LC-MS analysis some METT can react with DTT and it is not yet clear whether this occurs within the active site or spontaneously in solution.",

It is non-covalently bound in the active site of M pro . In contrast the antineoplastic drug carmofur is converted by M pro and its lipophilic hexamethylcarbamate moiety remains covalently bound to Cys145 (16), likely through a mechanism reminiscent of hydrolyzing a peptide substrate. Chemically the mechanism of reaction of carmofur with M pro is different from the one we observe for HEAT.",

Further evaluation of the antiviral activity of HEAT is required, as in a first high throughput screen of the same repurposing library it did not show any significant antiviral activity (4) . In spite of this, the complex between METT and M pro can be considered a starting point for future drug design efforts. Chemical modifications of the molecule might help to endow it with pharmacologically relevant inhibitory activity and to develop HEAT towards a viable drug option. The obtained results also strongly highlight that drug discovery investigations to treat SARS-CoV-2 should not only focus on traditional and conservative approaches aiming to identify substrate-analogue inhibitors, but should also include the identification and discovery of pro-drug compounds that could act as suicide drugs (17, 18) . This approach is based on the simple but effective idea of a classical pro-drug, which needs to be metabolized first before becoming toxic for the infecting agent, in this case the virus SARS-Cov-2 via deactivation of M pro . In this context and according to our postulated model, HEAT can be considered as a pro-drug as well as suicide drug which binds first to the active site of M pro , where it is cleaved in an E1cB-like reaction mechanism into 2methylene-1-tetralone and tyramine. The Cys145 sulfur subsequently binds covalently in a Michael addition to the methylene carbon atom of 2-methylene-1-tetralone thereby blocking the active site and inactivating M pro .",

M pro was buffer exchanged into 300 mM NH 4 OAc, pH 7.5 by five cycles of centrifugal gel filtration (Vivaspin columns, 30.000 MWCO, Sartorius). M pro (250 \u00b5M, 300 mM NH 4 OAc, pH 7.5) was incubated with HEAT (2.5 mM in DMSO) for 20 h and diluted 1:20. Nano ESI capillaries were pulled in-house from borosilicate capillaries (1.2 mm outer diameter, 0.68 mm inner diameter, filament, World Precision Instruments) with a micropipette puller (P-1000, Sutter instruments) using a squared box filament (2.5 \u00d7 2.5 mm 2 , Sutter Instruments) in a two-step program. Subsequently capillaries were gold-coated using a sputter coater (Q150R, Quorum Technologies) with 40 mA, 200 s, tooling factor 2.3 and end bleed vacuum of 8\u00d710 \u22122 mbar argon. Native MS was performed using an electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF) instrument (Q-TOF2, Micromass/Waters, MS Vision) modified for higher masses (27) . Samples were ionized in positive ion mode with voltages applied at the capillary of 1300 V and at the cone of 130 V. The pressure in the source region was kept at 10 mbar throughout all native MS experiments. For desolvation and dissociation, the pressure in the collision cell was adjusted to 1.8\u00d710 -2 mbar argon. Native-like spectra were obtained at an accelerating voltage of 30-100 V, while for collision-induced dissociation these voltages were increased to 150-170 V. In ESI-MS overview spectra, the quadrupole profile was 1-10,000 m/z. In tandem MS, for precursor selection, LMres and HMres were adjusted at 50 V collisional voltage until a single peak was recorded, and then dissociation was induced. To calibrate raw data, CsI (25 mg/ml) spectra were acquired and calibration was carried out with MassLynx (Waters) software. Data were analysed using MassLynx (Waters).",

(C-H) HPLC elution profile (ESI + , Total Ion Current) of the reaction products of HEAT alone (C) and with M pro in the presence of DTT (E) or TCEP (G). The mass spectra corresponding to the elution peaks are shown in D ([HEAT]H + ), F ([METT][DTT]Na + ) and H ([METT] 2 [DTT]Na + ). In addition, the small-molecule products from the reaction of HEAT with M pro were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)-MS in the range of 100 to 1000 Da (figure 2, see Methods). Pure HEAT elutes at 4.5 min and displays major ions at 296 Da (MH + ) and 318 Da (MNa + ). After overnight incubation (12 hours) at room temperature of an excess of HEAT with M pro , two new LC-MS peaks were observed at 6.4 and 8.5 min. Masses of 335.3 and 493.3 Da appear in the corresponding MS-ES + spectrum, which could not be attributed to either of the expected reaction products METT (183 Da) or TY (137 Da). These observed masses correspond to the two possible adducts of METT and DTT (154 Da), which was used as reducing agent in the protein buffer. The observed signals correspond to MNa + ions of METT bound to one or both thiol groups of DTT ([METT][DTT]Na + or [METT]2[DTT]Na + , respectively). The reaction product TY was observed in the MS-ESspectrum (137 Da, supp. figure 2) in the presence of M pro . To confirm the assignment of the METT and DTT adducts we substituted DTT with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) as reducing agent. In the absence of DTT no additional LC-MS signals besides HEAT were observed, and no masses corresponding to the METT-DTT adducts could be detected. This supports the presence of the proposed METT intermediate (figure 1F) in the HEAT cleavage mechanism, which can be intercepted by the strong nucleophilic thiol group of DTT. In contrast, TCEP is much less nucleophilic and hence does not react with the intermediate of the HEAT cleavage.",
