            "text": "The International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) are the most up to date international legal rules on the control of infectious diseases and provide a unified code for infectious disease control. The IHR name the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) as one of the international organisations with whom the WHO must cooperate and co-ordinate in implementing the IHR. It was organisations like the IFRC and MSF, that worked to stop the spread of Ebola following the outbreak in 2014. The focus of this chapter is the work of the IFRC during the Ebola outbreak. The IFRC carries out relief operations to assist victims of disasters, and combines this with development work to strengthen the capacities of its member National Societies. The IFRC's work focuses on four core areas: promoting humanitarian values, disaster response, disaster preparedness, and health and community care. Combining a study of the IFRC as an organisation with a legal mandate of its own, elucidated in the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and the more general international legal framework, this chapter uses international law as a framework to reflect on the limits and effectiveness of legal measures in responding to Ebola. To this end, international law provides a logical and global method to respond to infectious diseases. This chapter finds that the mandate and practice of the IFRC in the response to Ebola provides material to critically analyse each of these parts in light of infectious disease proliferation in 2014-2016. Since outbreak was announced in early 2014 more than 10,000 Red Cross volunteers were trained in Ebola response. IFRC supported emergency operations in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have targeted 23 million people.",

            "text": "The purpose of this chapter is to show the legal and practical relationships between the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) during the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014. Taking Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea as examples, this chapter considers the mandate and functions of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IRCRCM) and whether its mandate complements, or otherwise competes with, the infectious diseases and international law framework and regulations. The Red Cross mandate includes the provision of health care to civilians and combatants during conflict and disaster situations. 1 This will be described in the first part of the chapter. The Red Cross is not, however, alone in this role. The WHO, 2 MSF, 3 military actors, 4 NGOs and local actors all interlink and, hopefully, coordinate in the preparation for, response to, and rebuilding after the outbreak of an infectious disease. 5 Outbreak response will require medical assistance, possibly the participation of Emergency Medical Teams, and a rapid response in the areas of water, sanitation and hygiene, shelter and food. 6 Kamradt-Scott et al. argue that the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone proved to be an exceptional outbreak that blurred the lines between health and humanitarian crises. In so doing, it highlighted numerous problems with regard to the coordination of humanitarian disasters that have public health implications of international consequence. 7 In that context, this chapter shows the extensive mandate of the IFRC, and provides a critique of an institution that is widely underappreciated in the literature concerning global health, emergency medicine and humanitarian responses. The Red Cross is a unique humanitarian organisation with an arguablyunparalleled operational mandate to provide essential humanitarian protection and 1 Statutes of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (adopted by the 25th International Conference of the Red Cross at Geneva in 1986 Geneva in , amended in 1995 Geneva in and 2006 , preamble and principle of humanity, art 3(2) National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and art 6(4)(f) IFRC; Resolution 7 of the 31st International Conference of the Red Cross Red Crescent on 'Strengthening normative frameworks and addressing regulatory barriers concerning disaster mitigation, response and recovery' (12 January 2011); Resolution 6 of the 32nd International Conference of the Red Cross Red Crescent on 'Strengthening legal frameworks for disaster response, risk reduction and first aid' (10 December 2015). 2 Constitution of the World Health Organisation Constitution, reprinted in Basic Documents, Fortyfifth edition, Supplement, October 2006 art 2(a), (b). 3 Medecins Sans Frontiers mandate, https://www.msf.org.uk/?gclid= EAIaIQobChMIxPyCiLOT2AIVQ7HtCh3RqQtREAAYASAAEgIBxvD_BwE. 4 Kaplan and Easton-Calabria (2015) : MSF, which is a private, international association, has the mandate to 'bring humanitarian medical assistance to victims of conflict, natural disasters, epidemics or healthcare exclusion'. 5 Research Paper Ross et al.

This chapter provides an analysis of the relationship between the WHO and the IRCR. It builds on previous work that showed that the ICRC is an international legal person that has an international legal mandate to protect those in need during armed conflict. 8 That work examined the governance structure of the Movement and showed that the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is an institution with power and authority across multiple humanitarian situations, including disasters, armed conflicts, and other situations of violence. 9 The WHO and IFRC each take their rights and duties from international agreements signed by States, but their working methods make them very different actors. The National Societies of the Red Cross, such as the Liberian Red Cross Society, 10 Red Cross Society of Guinea 11 and the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society, 12 are auxiliaries to governments and are supported by the IFRC. The IFRC works through the existing networks on the ground in the provision of humanitarian aid and protection. The primary role of the WHO is the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health. 13 In order to achieve this, the functions of the WHO, detailed in Article 2 of the Constitution of the WHO, establish the WHO as the 'directing and co-ordinating authority on international health work'. 14 Article 2 outlines the WHO relationship with States, the United Nations, specialised agencies, governmental health administrations, professional groups and such other organisations as may be deemed appropriate. As with any international organisation, and the Red Cross Movement, the WHO assists Governments at their request and/ or with their consent. Its activities encompass technical support, the provision of aid, and health care (covering emergency assistance and also the overall improvement of international health). If we were to directly compare the WHO with the IFRC, we could say that the key similarity is the human-focused agenda which can only be realised through a State-centric system and is therefore dependent on consent. The key difference is the working method of each entity, as the IFRC is able to mobilise National Societies and support local actors and work towards health goals identified by the citizens, local groups and regional bodies. The WHO is much more hands-off, as it acts as a co-ordinating authority. We can see, therefore, that the WHO and IFRC have the ability to positively affect the ability of States to respond to infectious diseases, but with very different strategies and approaches; how these approaches compliment 8 See Shucksmith (2017) . 9 Ibid. 10 Liberian Red Cross Society, http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/where-we-work/africa/liberianred-cross-society/. 11 Red Cross of Guinea, http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/where-we-work/africa/red-crosssociety-of-guinea/. 12 Sierra Leone Red Cross Society, http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/where-we-work/africa/ sierra-leone-red-cross-society/. 13 For an excellent text on the WHO, see Lee (2009) . 14 Art 2 (a) Constitution of the WHO. or clash (as the case may be) during a health emergency is the focus of this chapter. With this in mind, this chapter shows the relationship between these two institutions and critically appraises the contribution of the IFRC to the Ebola response in 2014. It examines the coordination role of the WHO and the extent to which the IFRC is coordinated by the WHO and, on the other hand, the areas in which it exercises its autonomy and its own legal mandate.",

However, the WHO is responsible for the overall coordination of all responders. 15 Within this leadership role, I argue, the WHO must respect the international legal mandate of the IFRC and the roles that it has assumed. The WHO has the benefit of acting on the international stage and being able to speak to all actors, but the IFRC is better placed to manage the specific situation on the ground. Overall the chapter will examine what coordination is done by the WHO via the IHR; what is done by the UNGA; and what is done by the RCRCM.

These international agreements and the governance structure of the Red Cross Movement (from Geneva, to National Societies, to the field) allow the Red Cross to respond to humanitarian situations independently of other actors. This means, for example, that although the WHO may have the power to direct and coordinate activities and policies for global health, the Red Cross can act independently: States can ask for its help directly, it can act through the National Societies of States, and it can establish specific projects through its International Conference, such as the Health Care in Danger project 2011-2015.",

Henry Dunant envisaged an organisation with volunteer nurses and medics that would help any wounded soldiers, regardless of the side on which they fought. From these beginnings, the Red Cross has continued to develop its health care ambitions and capabilities. In part, its roles are mandated through the international agreements, to which States are parties. These roles of the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies include cooperation with public authorities in the prevention of disease, the promotion of health and the mitigation of human suffering. 19 The IFRC is mandated to 'encourage and coordinate the participation of the National Societies in activities for safeguarding public health and the promotion of social welfare in cooperation with their appropriate national authorities'. 20 In addition, the Red Cross is able to act autonomously within States owing to its international legal personality and its existing presence in each State in the guise of the National Societies. This sets it apart from other organisations. There are three distinct branches of the Movement; the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of the Red Cross, and the National Societies. 21 Generally speaking, the IFRC carries out relief operations to assist victims of disasters, and combines this with development work to strengthen the capacities of its member National Societies. 22 The IFRC's work focuses on four core areas: promoting humanitarian values, disaster response, disaster preparedness, and health and community care. 23 Its aim is to inspire, facilitate and promote all humanitarian activities carried out by its member National Societies on behalf of the most vulnerable people. As with all components of the Red Cross, it acts independently, meaning that it is not 'governmental, political, racial or sectarian in character'. 24 The IFRC has access to local knowledge and expertise, through National Societies, which makes it an invaluable responder when there is an outbreak of disease.",

Thus, the three constituent components of the Red Cross are 'responders' to humanitarian crises, including infectious diseases. It is theoretically possible to look at the Red Cross response to Ebola in isolation, but international organisations do not act in a vacuum. It is one thing to describe the mandate and activities of one entity, it is another thing entirely to understand how multiple actors interact, coordinate and respond to the outbreak of infectious diseases. This chapter provides an initial overview of the extent to which the WHO, tasked with coordination of response, can 'dictate' to a humanitarian organisation, which existed prior to its conception.",

Once a person is infected, the disease can spread through sweat, tears, mucus, saliva, vomit, diarrhoea, breast milk, urine, blood, and through sexual intercourse. 30 The 2014 West African outbreak of the disease was the worst to date, culminating in Public Health Emergency of International Concern being declared in August 2014. 31 The outbreak began in remote rural districts of Guinea and was later reported in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some incidences of illness had been reported in November and December 2013, and in late January 2014, local health officials in Guinea investigated unexplained deaths, suspecting cholera. Three days later, a larger investigatory team, including MSF and regional WHO, began work. As the infection spread, it also led to cases 27 http://www.ifrc.org/en/news-and-media/news-stories/africa/guinea/. 28 http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/where-we-work/africa/liberian-red-cross-society/. 29 http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/where-we-work/africa/sierra-leone-red-cross-society/. 30 Stein (2015) . in cities, where the risk of the spread of infection was much higher. 32 By the 1st February, the infection had spread into Conakry, Guinea's capital and largest city. It was not until the 13th March that the Ministry of Health in Guinea issued its first alert, followed by an investigation from 14 to 25 March. It was during this time, on the 21 March 2014, that the disease was identified as Ebola. Cases were reported in Liberia on 22 March 2014, and it was at this point that the infection could have been deemed to be an international epidemic.",

One limitation to the initial response by the state itself is that public health systems in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were 'already weakened by protracted conflicts, [and were] struggling to implement measures to contain the virus'. 33 In addition, as Alasan Senghore writes, West Africa's cultural, political and geographical context, with porous borders and a mobile population, [had] much to do with the unprecedented scale of [the epidemic]. So has the parlous state of health systems, some in countries not long emerged from conflict. Community distrust-of institutions and agencies-has certainly had an impact. As a consequence, health information campaigns have struggled. 34 In brief, state health care systems were not ready for Ebola, and health workers lacked specialised equipment and training. Some succumbed to the disease, while others refused to work for fear of infection. 35 A lack of available national healthcare facilities, especially primary care services, is an issue for many post-conflict states. 36 In situations like this, the response of the international community and actors is critical to prevent the spread of the infection. The outbreak required international cooperation to treat those already infected and prevent the spread of infection further. As the WHO and IFRC stated, [t] he high mortality rates (over 70% among untreated patients), the exponential escalation of cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and the potential for the epidemic to spread globally through international travel resulted in a massively scaled and coordinated international response from Emergency Medical Teams. 37 32 Campbell (2017) . 33 Murray et al. (2014) . 34 Foreword by Alasan Senghore (IFRC Africa Regional Director) in IFRC (2015a). The speed of response was much faster in Nigeria, where the first case was confirmed in July 2014; health officials immediately repurposed technologies and infrastructures from the WHO and other partners to find and track potential chains of transmission of Ebola. 38 The end of transmission in Liberia, and the 'effective end of the outbreak in West Africa', was marked on the 14th January 2016. 39",

The first is consent by states to external actors being present; the second is that, as infectious diseases do not respect state borders, states and organisations must collaborate and cooperate to prevent, respond to and recover from infection. Sovereignty is paramount to states and therefore any global intervention must be consented to by the state. 42 The International Sanitary Conferences were convened to meet the need for agreeing quarantine procedures to prevent the spread of diseases, particularly cholera, without unduly disrupting rapidly growing international trade. 43 In 1903, the first international organisation dedicated to health was created. Fidler argues that, at the time, the international legal regime had three pillars: (1) duties to notify other States of outbreaks of specified diseases, (2) limits on the measures other states could take against ships and aircraft coming from states experiencing disease outbreaks, and (3) involvement of an international organisation dedicated to health. 44 The international legal framework that facilitates the provision of healthcare during outbreaks of disease is complex and refers to a multitude of actors that can enter into partnerships, forge relationships to oversee certain activities, or coordinate response on the ground.",

Nevertheless, the mandate provided to the Red Cross by the Geneva Conventions envisaged a humanitarian presence at the consent of sovereign states and, furthermore, created a system whereby there was a potentially permanent Red Cross presence in every state. Official relations were established between the WHO and the League of Red Cross Societies, the previous name of the IFRC, in 1948. 45 What these parallel systems mean today is that it is unclear which actor has the ultimate authority. Can the WHO, as a specialised agency of the UN, coordinate an international institution with its own mandate provided by international agreement? 46 It is all very well to think about the relationship between the WHO and NGOs active in health and humanitarianism, but the Red Cross is different from such entities. What is the more nuanced relationship between the WHO and the Red Cross? Is it possible to determine the power and authority of each in the provision of health care and the prevention of the spread of infectious disease?",

In a global age, however, the perceived threat and potential responders go beyond neighbouring states. Globalisation and increased travel and trade within and between countries have resulted in the rapid spread of disease. This was typified by the rapid spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) across three continents within weeks in 2003 59 and by pandemic 2009-H1N1 influenza. 60 There is, therefore, an international legal framework including the Constitution of the WHO and the IHRs that seeks to provide an adequate response to outbreaks of infectious diseases. Overall, the IHRs aim to provide global health security but this relies on informational and communication channels being utilised to pass correct information from local healthcare providers to national bodies and then on to the WHO.",

She argued that the WHO needed to build partnerships with other institutions as 'partnerships are integral to its operations', but highlighted 54 Clift (2013c Dupuy (1991) in Fidler (n 41) 63. 59 Skowronski et al.

(2016) . 65 PHEIC of 8th August. 71 It could be suggested that that this delay is indicative of a weak international framework for the response to international epidemics, but the alternative argument is that the WHO was involved through its regional organs. In addition, indeed, 'the WHO's coordinating role in developing the Ebola vaccine also highlights one of its unique benefits-no other body has the convening power of this intergovernmental agency, which can rapidly bring together scientists, industry, regulators and national public-health officials when needed'. 72 Though '[o] nly the government of [an] affected country can make the decision whether to accept or reject EMTs (Emergency Medical Teams) in non-conflict disasters', 73 it is recognised, however, that there is a multitude of complex reasons as to why the treatment delivered during a pandemic may not be the highest standard available, most notably that many states who bear the greatest burden of infectious diseases are the least well positioned to respond to outbreaks. 74 In its joint 2017 publication, 'The Regulation and Management of International Emergency Medical Teams', the WHO and IFRC noted that [t] he tasking of teams responding to the EVD outbreak followed a 4-step process. Firstly, teams either stepped forward and offered their assistance (very few actually did this), or were directly approached by the WHO EMT initiative. Secondly, local needs were assessed and as far as possible met by the WHO and its partners. Thirdly, the WHO helped channel the offers of assistance to the respective Ministries of Health. Fourthly, tasking to an ETC location was undertaken by the Ministry of Health with support from the WHO EMT coordination cell. Importantly, this process could only begin once there were sufficient numbers of EMTs offering their assistance; therefore the majority of steps 3 and 4 did not take place until November and December 2014. The complexity of a three-country response to Ebola was further compounded when individual donor countries supported specific countries that were affected, rather than all three (e.g. the US supported Liberia, the UK supported Sierra Leone, and France supported Guinea). 75",

Gostin suggests that in the past, this has led to 'a vicious cycle of disease emergence, failure to report, and economic ramifications'. 76 It doesn't appear from the existing literature and reports concerning Ebola that the lack of reporting in Guinea was down to fear of economic ramifications, but rather owing to incorrect diagnosis and insufficient public health infrastructure. 77 71 WHO Statement, 'Statement on the 1st meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee on the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa' (8 August 2014), http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/ 2014/ebola-20140808/en/. 72 https://www.nature.com/news/the-time-is-ripe-to-reform-the-world-health-organisation-1. The more critical comments were levied at the delay by the WHO responding to Ebola. It took over eight months from the first case to the WHO declaration. The Director-General of WHO called for UN full capacity to help with the response. 78 On the 18th September 2014, the UN Security Council, for the first time, declared a disease outbreak as a threat to international peace and security. This was the first time they had used 'declaratory' language. 79 The securitisation of disease at the UNSC is not without precedent-the Security Council concerned itself with AIDS, although this took 19 years, and Article 39 of the UN Charter was not used. 80 Perhaps what is more critical when looking at this gap between identification of the disease and UN response is the context. In the context of this paper, I would contend that the addition of other UN agencies, beyond WHO, makes the coordination and response even more confusing. In addition to the coordination role of the WHO, the UN has other mechanisms to respond to global health crises.",

The WHO, UNMEER, and the Red Cross undertook several actions, established working groups and committees, and coordinated on the ground to try to stop the spread of infection and to treat those who had already succumbed. They relied on partnerships with each other and the governments of each state. The working relationships were essential as the outbreak was too large in scale for one organisation, state or local community to respond to alone. The necessity of expertise, resources, technical assistance, and personnel required a coordinated and sustained approach. The international legal framework that facilitates the provision of healthcare during outbreaks of disease is complex and involves a multitude of actors that can enter into partnerships, forge relationships to oversee certain activities, or coordinate response on the ground. The IFRC is a 'partner' of the WHO in disaster response and has established 'formal agreements' in several contexts to facilitate its presence and role in specific situations on the ground. 85 It also has an active agreement, a Memorandum of Understanding, with the South-East Asia Regional Office of the World Health Organisation (SEARO). 86 The IHRs do not specifically mention the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies but the IFRC is named as one of the international organisations with which the WHO must co-operate in implementing the IHRs. 87 The IFRC and National Societies work with governments on humanitarian protection and assistance issues and it is one of the aims of the IFRC to help governments prepare its legislation and resources for disaster situations. In fact, part of the role of the National Societies is to make the governments aware of changes in legislation that may be necessary to implement the IHR. At the national level, therefore, the National Societies can help to improve pandemic preparedness and response, which in turn can prevent the spread of disease, thus protecting international public health.",

The Red Cross is a standalone humanitarian organisation and partner of the WHO/ IASC at the international level. It can interpret its own mandate and support or be called upon to support the work of other international actors. In addition, its National Societies provide it with an existing local presence, which aids in the provision of humanitarian relief during times of conflict and in the event of a disaster. Nevertheless, overall, the picture is quite confusing as to who is lead agent, whether the IFRC is an autonomous actor, and whether the IFRC coordinates successfully with other agencies. The Red Cross, in some ways, escapes the political and economic hindrances of the international stage and can respond to outbreaks of disease from the 'bottom-up'. The mandate of the IFRC allows it to respond to public health emergencies and it also has a separate role in disaster relief and disaster risk reduction.",

The UN is not the only organisation that States will form agreements with, as actors such as the Red Cross have the capacity to negotiate and enter into agreements too. Moreover, the UN does not always have the operational capacity to respond adequately. The dilemma facing responders is whether there should be one central coordinating body for the entire response, perhaps the WHO, or whether they are each within their rights to do what they want and help whom they want. In this light, the IHRs might, by necessity, have to be renegotiated to include specific mention of a wider set of institutions.

The Red Cross provides a counterpart to the more state interest focused international system, which includes the WHO and IHR. The Red Cross was created to provide humanitarian protection and assistance directly to those in need. The Red Cross has an international mandate to provide health care to civilians and combatants during conflict and disaster situations. 90 Critically, the Red Cross was designed to reach communities and people in need. It is still subject to the consent of states, whether that is through the Geneva Conventions, Statutes of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and Headquarters agreements. However, its principles mean that is stays in favour with governments and is able to stay in countries for long periods of time. The ICRC, for example, often maintains a presence long after an identifiable armed conflict has ended. In this way, its reputation and humanitarian mandate set is apart from other organisations and NGOs. In circumstances where, for whatever reason, states decide that they no longer wish for the Red Cross to work within its territory, states might, should they be so inclined, refuse to grant visas to delegates, or perhaps even revoke visas, but this is unlikely. The Red Cross is renowned for its discretion and states trust that the organisation will work without exposing its inability to provide for its own population.",

The IFRC was already on the ground in Guinea working through a cholera epidemic and measles outbreak. 92 However, as symptoms of Ebola are similar to cholera, it was difficult for the IFRC to recognise and, therefore, announce that Ebola was spreading. Ebola outbreaks have occurred previously but the IFRC documented that this outbreak presented several unique challenges. Firstly, it affected communities and governments that were 'new to the disease' and did not have the appropriate equipment, facilities and procedures in place. Secondly, in some areas people believed that the people spraying disinfectant were the ones spreading the disease, which caused violent, sometimes deadly, reactions. In addition, some cultural practices, including burial practices, facilitated the spread of the disease. 93 Finally, the outbreak occurred in an area where three states-Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia-have borders, and 'the porous nature of the borders of the countries involved, regional trade, interconnectedness of families and fluid population movement both within and between the affected countries [was] key to the geographical spread'. 94 In terms of the IFRC response to Ebola, Alasan Senghore stated that [t] he Red Cross and Red Crescent is community-based. Our people were there before the outbreak and they will remain there when it is over and most of the other responders have gone. It is what we have always been about, and our volunteers will continue to support communities as they recover, not only in relation to Ebola but also the parallel health and humanitarian challenges. 95",

When people succumb to disease, they need access to health care that will cure them or, at the very least, ease their suffering. States have the primary obligation to provide such through national health care systems, but there is no universal standard for this. When an infectious disease affects the human population and the State is unable to stop its spread, there is a number of actors on the international stage with the mandate to react and protect people. To this end, international law provides a global legal framework to regulate and coordinate the international response to infectious diseases, including through the mandate of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IRCRCM) and the Constitution of the WHO. Of course, any response to infectious disease needs to be bespoke to the disease but there exist a number of international laws and international institutions to provide global mechanisms by which external actors, States and organisations, can support States threatened by the spread of disease.",

This is particularly the case with the IFRC and National Societies which have built and nurtured relationships with States and each other for decades in order to develop institutional best practice.
