            "text": "There are at least 869 species or subspecies of ticks recognized [1] . These comprise of two major families: the Ixodidae or hard-ticks because of their sclerotized, hard dorsal plate, which represent the most important group medically and numerically, and the Argasidae or soft-ticks because of their flexible cuticle. A third family consisting of a single species, the Nuttalliellidae, is confined to southern Africa [1] . Ticks have three stages in their life cycle: the larval, nymphal, and adult forms. Hard-ticks and soft-ticks differ morphologically and in their life cycle and ecology. Ixodid ticks have several advantageous attributes for transmitting infectious pathogens as vectors more than soft-ticks or argasids. Ixodid ticks feed for long periods [several days], firmly attached to the host, and remain unnoticed as their bite is painless, and their feeding hosts include a large variety of vertebrates in diverse habitats [1] . Argasids, conversely, feed briefly and often on a single host species, and they live in dry areas, mostly in sheltered habitat near their hosts [1] . It is believed that ticks evolve about 225 million years ago in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic eras, initially parasitizing reptiles [8] .",

Each stage of the tick attaches and feeds on a single host over several days; then once satiated it detaches and finds a resting place to molt to the next stage. The larva and nymph are the main transmitters of diseases, as the adult feeds only briefly and the males may not feed at all. Ixodid ticks actually spend >90% of their life cycle unattached from the host and mainly live in open areas of meadows but are transported to woods by their hosts [9] .

Some tick species are host specific, feeding only a limited variety of animals, but this may vary with the stage, and some ticks have different host for each feeding stage. In general the animals in their habitat influence host selection and diverse species of ticks have different affinities for attacking humans [10] . The relationship with ecology or environment, natural animal inhabitants and host specificity or range, and geographic distribution are all interrelated with respect to the life cycle of these ticks. The brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, for instance, is well adapted to the vegetation and climate in the Mediterranean region and other areas with similar conditions such as Mexico, Arizona, California, Texas, and parts of Brazil, all regions where the brown dog tick can transmit rickettsial pathogens. Each feeding stage of R. sanguineus has high specificity, and it readily feeds on dogs and is important vectors for Mediterranean spotted fever in the Mediterranean region, and occasionally Rocky Mountain spotted fever in southwestern US and Mexico. In contrast, Ixodes scapularis [black-legged deer tick] in the US and Ixodes ricinus [European sheep tick] in Europe are adapted to the woods and forests with relative high humidity and are sensitive to desiccation from dry places. Ticks inhabiting wooded areas, I. scapularis, I. ricinus, Amblyomma american [lone star tick], and others, feed on different host species, such as small and large mammals and birds [1, 11] .",

Soft-bodied ticks [argasids] are inhabitants of sheltered environments, nests, caves, burrows, and primitive man-made shelters. Unlike ixodids, they lack cement from the salivary glands for firm attachment but produce anticoagulants and cytolytic substances to facilitate brief multiple feeding times [1] . Thus, the time spent on the host is relatively short, up to a few hours, and after meals they can be found in cracks and crevices or below the soil surface in their home environment.",

Rickettsiae once considered nonpathogenic to humans and new species have been identified in the past 25 years. There are now 26 Rickettsia species validated in addition to subspecies mentioned. Some new species identified since 2005 include Rickettsia asiatica, Rickettsia heilongjiangesis, Rickettsia hoogstraalii, Rickettsia raoulti, and Rickettsia tamourae [27] . Tickborne rickettsiosis is now present in all continents of the world and some Caribbean and Pacific islands. Rickettsia africae which causes African tick-bite fever is believed to have been exported from Africa during the slave trade of the 1800s to several Caribbean islands, Guadeloupe, St. Kitts, Nevis, Dominica, US Virgin Islands, Montserrat, St. Lucia, Martinique, and Antigua [27] .",

Birds are important reservoirs for several pathogens and act as vehicles for infected ticks and probably play an important role in the dispersal of tickborne zoonoses [29] . Although for each pathogen one or more tick vectors and several animal reservoirs may exist, various combinations of coinfection with different microbes may coexist, and studies have demonstrated mixed infection in ticks of 7-10.9% [29, 30] . For example, the black-legged deer tick [I. scapularis], from the northeastern and upper midwestern US, can be coinfected and transmit multiple pathogens to humans such as Lyme and myamotoi borreliosis, anaplasma, babesia, and Powassan virus. Concurrent infection by two or more tickborne microbes is fairly common and frequently detected in clinical and veterinary practice [31] . Coinfection with multiple pathogens may be transmitted by ticks simultaneously during the same blood meal or at separate times. The natural reservoir hosts of many microbes [B. burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti] transmitted by Ixodes ticks are rodents, which are often coinfected with multiple organisms and may transfer the microbes to the larvae or nymphs and then to animals and humans [32] . Simultaneous coinfection of several pathogens may result in diverse host responses, which can conflict and antagonize each other, allowing the pathogens to synergistically infect the host more successfully, with more prolonged and severe disease with multitude of clinical manifestations, than normally reported with a single pathogen infection [33] . Sequential infection with a new microbe may allow the establishment of a new infection which otherwise may not have occurred because of elimination by the host immune defense mechanisms [31] .",

Transmission from contamination of abraded skin or mucosa of the eye following crushing of the ticks with the fingers is possible. Transmission by accidental ingestion of the arthropods is well known in animals and is possible to occur in humans. Transmission of several tickborne zoonoses can occur by blood transfusion and sharing of needles and syringes from an unsuspected blood donor or drug abuser. Different Babesia species, for instance, have been reported to be transmitted from blood transfusions in both animals [dogs] and humans [31] . The Bunyaviridae family of viruses constitutes the largest group of RNA viruses with more than 350 identified [35] . They are enveloped, spherical virions with a diameter of 80-120 \u03bcm, containing three single-stranded RNA segments [negative sense], with no matrix proteins [35] . [36, 37] . Presently there are at least 40 viruses of the Bunyaviridae family not assigned a genera or species, including Bhanja virus, Forecariah virus, and the Kismayo virus [38] . The Bhanja serogroup viruses are most closely related to SFTSV and the Heartland virus, and members of this group have been isolated from ticks on livestock and wild animals in India, Southern Europe, and Africa [38] .",

Locally transmitted cases have also been identified in Japan with 11 cases recognized by 2013, all living in western Japan, and were >50 years of age, and there were six fatalities [57] . Phylogenetic analysis of the Japanese isolates indicated that the genotype was independent from those in China. It has been estimated that SFTSV was likely circulating unrecognized in animals and humans in Korea and Japan for sometimes before these reports.

Viral RNA of SFTSV was also detected in H. longicornis ticks at all stages of its life cycle, indicating both transstadial and transovarial routes of transmission and the ability of ticks to play a role as a vector and a reservoir of the virus [60] . In a study from South Korea, 13,000 ticks were examined for SFTSV from nine provinces, and the minimum detection rate in H. longicornis was 0.46%, with the highest prevalence in the southern region [61] . In South Korea SFTSV was also detected in other hard-ticks at lower rates, Ixodes nipponensis and Amblyomma testudinarium [62] , and in China the virus was also detected in mites from field mice and goats in endemic regions [44] .

Low levels of viral RNA were found in a small fraction [1.7-5 .3%] of the animals studied [48, 65] . The viruses from animals and those from patients and ticks shared 95.4% of the genomic sequences [65] . Many wild animals such as deer, hedgehog, weasel, possum, and some bird species are hosts for the vector ticks and could carry the virus. However, rodents are known reservoirs of many bunyaviruses, but the rates of infection of rats [3.03-8%] with SFTSV are lower than in livestock [48, 66] . Hence, it appears that domestic animals may be the amplifying hosts of SFTSV and are probably the main reservoir of the virus.",

In a study of 298 confirmed cases of SFTS and 55 followed after convalescence, during the first week of illness, there was a loss of T, B, and NK lymphocytes which were subsequently restored, but severe disease was associated with slower recovery and lower humeral immunity [77] . SFTSV-specific IgM antibody could be detected within 9 days, peaked at 4 weeks, and persisted for 6 months. IgG antibody could be detected in most patients within 6 weeks, peaked at 6 months, and persisted for at least 3 years [77] . There is also evidence that SFTSV is capable of infecting monocytes and suppresses IFNbeta and NF-kappa B promoter activities, facilitating the virus replication in human monocytes by restricting the innate immune response [78] . The virus can also disrupt type 1 interferon signaling by the nonstructural protein-mediated sequestering of signal molecules [STATS I and II] into inclusion bodies [79] . IFN-\u03b2 production is an important host defense mechanism against viral pathogens, and inhibition of this response has been reported with other bunyaviruses [80, 81] .",

Newborn mice and rats, especially Kunming mice, are highly susceptible to SFTSV, and infected mice demonstrate pathological changes with large areas of necrosis only in the liver, but the virus can be detected in numerous organs [84] . Interferon-\u03b1/interferon-\u03b2 knockout mice are also highly susceptible to infection with the virus, with 100% mortality in 3-4 days after inoculation [85] . The virus is found in numerous organs with heavy viral burden in mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen but no detectable histological changes. It appears that C57/BL6 mouse may be a better model for SFTSV infection, as the animals demonstrate leucopenia and thrombocytopenia similar to humans [86] . Moreover, histopathological changes were found in the spleen, liver, and kidney, but the spleen appears to be the primary target as viral replication could be demonstrated in this organ. The thrombocytopenia is probably caused by virus-bound platelets that underwent phagocytosis by splenic macrophages [86] . Nonhuman primates are considered the gold standard animal models for studying human disease pathogenesis, and a recent study has been reported by infecting rhesus macaques. SFTSV infection of Macaca mulatta did not result in severe disease symptoms or death but caused fever, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, and elevated transaminases and cardiac enzymes [87] . Minor pathological lesions were found in the liver and kidney during the late stages of infection, and elevation of inflammatory cytokines was present in the blood. Thus, infection of this primate model resembles mild SFTS in humans.",

The first stage of the disease is characterized by sudden onset of fever from 38 to 41\u00b0C, headache, fatigue, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, associated with high viral load, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and elevation of transaminases and creatine phosphokinase. This stage may last for 5-11 days but may resolve after a week and enter a convalescent phase in patients with mild disease. The second stage occurs after 5 days and in more severe disease progress to develop multiorgan failure, first involving the liver, then the heart, lungs, and kidneys, which can persist for 7-14 days or lead to death [44, 90] .

The patient had a history of multiple tick bites, with detectable tick on his body 2 weeks prior to onset of illness, and had comorbid conditions of chronic obstructive lung disease and alcoholism. He presented with weakness, fever, and altered mental status, and tests showed persistent leucopenia, progressive thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated transaminases. His clinical course deteriorated on broad-spectrum antibiotics and subsequent hypotension, hypoxia, and renal dysfunction occurred before his death. Autopsy findings were largely nonspecific and the bone marrow revealed myeloid hyperplasia and trilineage hematopoiesis. Although this fatal case resembles severe cases of SFTS, there was no evidence of necrotizing lymphadenitis as described in fatal cases of infection with SFTSV, but the spleen demonstrated white-pulp depletion and scattered immunoblasts [105] .

            "text": "Novel tickborne infections continue to emerge in distant unrelated regions of the world with worrisome frequency. New, previously unrecognized, pathogens from tick exposure will continue to be discovered in the future. This is further exemplified by the recent detection of a novel Orthomyxovirus of the genus Thogotovirus, labeled Bourbon virus, associated with a fatal infection in a previously healthy male from Kansas after tick bites in 2014 [114] . The differential diagnosis of acute febrile illness after tick exposure is quite diverse and largely depends on the local region or geography at the time of exposure. For instance, in the US, there are 14 tickborne diseases listed by CDC, and now there will be 15 with the addition of Bourbon virus [see Table 5 .1] Tickborne diseases are theoretically preventable with appropriate clothing [long sleeve shirts and pants], avoidance of high-risk exposures, use of insecticides or acaricides to control tick population, or use of personal insect repellants. Despite these known preventative measures, for decades tickborne diseases have continued to flourish with worldwide expansion and emergence. Thus, new approaches for prevention of tickborne infections are needed. Directed mass education of targeted atrisk populations [farmers, outdoor campers, hikers, etc.] in endemic areas may be of benefit to inform the public of the risk of these diseases and preventative measures, including large visible signs in these areas. Development of specific vaccines for these various pathogens is not feasible nor would be cost-effective due to their relatively low frequency. However, it may be worthwhile to evaluate new strategies such as a vaccine to prevent tick bites that could be used to prevent many tickborne diseases. Anti-tick vaccines could potentially reduce tickborne infections by reducing the tick burden or interference in host-tick-human transmission by vaccination of the vertebrate hosts [115] . Anti-tick vaccines would be environmentally safe, unlikely to select resistance as compared to insecticides, and can include multiple antigens to target a broad range of ticks [116] . ",

The most common tickborne viruses belong to the Flaviviridae family and are endemic in Europe and Asia: tickborne encephalitis virus [TBEV] being the most common in Europe, louping illness virus [LIV], Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus [OHFV], and Kyasanur Forest disease virus [KFDV]; in the Middle East Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus [AHFV]; and in North America only the Powassan virus from this group is present [34]. TBEV is widely distributed in Europe and the vector is I. ricinus, the sheep dog tick. Prior to 2009-2010, the only recognized members of the Bunyaviridae family causing tickborne infection in humans were the Crimean-Congo virus and the Bhanja virus. Since then two similar bunyaviruses of the Phlebovirus genus have emerged in China in 2009, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus [SFTSV], and the Heartland virus in the US in 2012.",
