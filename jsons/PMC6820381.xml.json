It was noticed that the exposure to both a RV infection and HDM in sensitive mice compared to the exposure to the virus alone, resulted in a decrease in multiple immune pathway components such as IFN- \u03bb, IFN-\u03b2, TLR3.

These mediators stimulate production of IL5 that is responsible for eosinophilic infiltration.[62] Furthermore, and during an acute viral infection stage, patients have a greater influx and recruitment of eosinophils when compared to the pre-infection period.[63]",
