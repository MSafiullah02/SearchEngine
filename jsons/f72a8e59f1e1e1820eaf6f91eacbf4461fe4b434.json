We call such models as population migration models and migration epidemics models, respectively. We first apply the theories of positive operators and positive semigroups to make systematic investigation to asymptotic behavior of solutions of the population migration models as time goes to infinity, and next use such results to study asymptotic behavior of solutions of the migration epidemics models as time goes to infinity. Some interesting properties of solutions of these models are obtained.",

Classical epidemics models only consider temporal effects of interactions of different groups of population such as the susceptible group, the infective group, and the recovered (or removed or immune) group, and spatial distribution of the population in which epidemics is spread are usually ignored. Since spatial movement of population is clearly an important factor of the spread of epidemics, recently increasingly much attention on this topic has been paid on investigation of spatial effects of the population on dynamical behavior of infectious diseases, and an increasingly large amount of spatial epidemics models have appeared in the literature, cf.

It follows that applications of different temporal-spatial population models to the study of dynamics of infectious diseases yield different spatial epidemics models. Existing spatial epidemics models are either built on the basis of multi-patch (or multi-country, metapopulation etc.) population models [1, 4, 5, 6, 15, 28, 30, 38, 40, 41] , or constructed on applications of reaction-diffusion equations to population systems [2, 22, 23, 24, 25, 33, 35, 37] , or obtained by combining ideas of the above two approaches together. Mathematical analysis of such models have revealed many interesting phenomena, cf. the references mentioned above, especially [1, 2, 6, 15, 23, 37] .",

            "text": "In the meantime of sufficiently recognizing great success achieved by those spatial epidemics models as mentioned above, we must also be aware of their limitations in application to the spread of epidemics in the human population system. Clearly, multi-patch epidemics models are useful only to population systems with habitat domain being a combination of isolated subdomains like pools, lakes and islands. Moreover, lakes and islands must be very small so that when an infectious disease occurs in one lake or island then all individuals living in that lake or island are infected within a short period, i.e., population in each patch must be homogeneous in getting infected by the epidemics. It follows that application of such models to continental human population system is not very suitable. As far as reaction-diffusion epidemics models are concerned, its limitation in application arises from a different argument. In ancient times transportation tools are so undeveloped that common people usually cannot move very far from their habitat locations. Taking this situation into account, reaction-diffusion equations are a good choice to mimic spatial movement of ancient human population in which epidemics is spread. This explains success of application of the reaction-diffusion epidemic model in the analysis of the spread of black death in Europe during 1347\u223c1350 [33] . But nowadays due to popular applications of long-distance reachable high-speed transportation tools like trains and airplanes, travel distance of common people has dramatically increased. It turns out that the situation has become quite different, and many non-diffusion types of spatial movement of population such as tourist and commercial travels, migrations of rural people to cities for study and jobs, visiting travels between relative families or friends and so on have become main causes of spread of infectious disease. Take the worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during November 2002 till July 2003 as an example. It first appeared in November 16, 2002 in Foshan, which is a county city in the Guangdong Province adjacent to Guangzhou. Weeks after its onset, some patients were sent to Guangzhou for medical treatment, resulting in the spread of the disease in hospitals in Guangzhou during the following three months. Infected people during that period were mainly medical personnel and patients in hospitals in Guangzhou, and their families. On February 21, 2003 , a retired professor of the Second Affiliated Hospital of the Sun Yat-Sen University who had been keeping working in his hospital as a doctor went to Hongkong to attend the wedding ceremony of a relative of him, bringing SARS to Hongkong. It is in Hongkong that spread of SARS first became explosive: 1755 people were infected and among them 299 died during the following four months. On March 6, 2003 a hospital in Beijing received the first SARS patient. Soon Beijing became the second explosive spread place of this disease: 2434 people were infected and among them 147 died during the following four months. On March 13, 2003 Taiwan reported first SARS infection case, and during the following four months Taiwan totally reported 307 infected cases (including 47 deaths). According to a report made by WHO, from November 16, 2002 till July 11, 2003 totally 29 countries in the world reported SARS infection cases, and totaly 8069 people were infected by SARS with 775 people among them died [42, 43] . Besides the cities and regions mentioned above, the other very serious SARS infection places include the following provinces of China: Guangdong (1514 cases with 56 deaths), Shanxi (445 cases with 20 deaths), Inner Mongolia (289 cases with 25 deaths), Hebei (210 cases with 10 deaths) and Tianjin (176 cases with 12 deaths) (see Table 1 for the distribution in China of SARS cases reported in the 2002\u223c2003 outbreak), and the following countries: Canada (250 cases with 38 deaths), Singapore (206 cases with 32 deaths), United States (71 cases without deaths) and Viet Nam (63 cases with 5 deaths) (see Table 2 for the distribution of SARS cases reported in the 2002\u223c2003 outbreak). Here we particularly mention that though in the Guangdong Province (whose capital city is Guangzhou) the spread of SARS is serious, the situation in its four neighboring provinces is, however, much better: There were only 22 cases (with 3 deaths) in the Guangxi Province, 6 cases (with 1 death) in the Hunan Province, 1 case (without death) in the Jiangxi Province, and 3 cases (without death) in the Fujian Province. From this example we easily see that in modern world the spread of epidemics among human population cannot be well modeled by reaction-diffusion equations, but instead seriously depends on communications of inhabitants in different places.",

            "text": "Based on the above consideration, in this paper we study a different class of spatial epidemics models constructed on the basis of population migration models. Here, population migration models refer to so-called population dispersal models in existing literatures [7, 9, 11, 16, 27, 17, 18, 19, 20] . We use the terminology migration rather than dispersal due to the following consideration: These models are constructed on the assumption that spatial movement of individuals in the population system under study depends only on geographic variables, i.e., the tendency and strength of population movement from one location the the other is uniquely determined by the departure and the arrival locations (because of some population-density independent reasons such as pursuit of better resources in job and education, official, commercial or sightseeing-aimed travel, and etc.); it does not have apparent dependence on the density of the population, so that both \"diffusion\" and \"dispersal\" are not suitable to be used to depict such a movement. Hence, these population models are not new; they have appeared many times in the above-mentioned and some other references. However, to the best of our knowledge, dynamical behavior of the population system described by these models has not been very well understood. For the purpose to get a good understanding of dynamics of the spread of infectious disease in such a population system, we shall thus first make a systematic investigation to asymptotic behavior of solutions of the population migration models. This will be performed by using the well-established theories of positive operators and positive semigroups as lectured in the references [3, 21, 34, 39] , and will be presented in Section 2. We shall next in Section 3 use the results obtained from a such analysis to study three migration epidemics models: The migration SI model, the migration SIR model, and the migration SIRE model. These temporal-spatial epidemics models are obtained by adding migration terms into classical spatial homogeneous epidemics models; they have the form of nonlinear differential-integral equations. As a first step of the study in this direction, we shall be content with deriving some elementary results on asymptotic behavior of solutions of these migration epidemic models, and leave more advanced investigation of other related topics, which are very diversified, for future work. In the last section we make a summary to the discussion of this manuscript.",

They describe the evolution of the density of a system of population living in a spatial domain \u2126 \u2286 R n . Individuals in this population system can move from one location to the other with a rate uniquely determined by their departure and arrival locations. We use the terminology \"migration\" to address spatial movement of the population and call the rate mentioned above as \"migration rate\". The migration rate function determines to a great extent the dynamical behavior of the population system. We shall mainly consider a special class of population system in which individuals can migrate from any one location to any other location through finite steps of intermediate migrations. We call such a population system as \"ergodic system\". In the proliferation-stationary case, dynamical behavior of the population in such a system can be very well understood by applying the theories of irreducible positive operators and irreducible positive semigroups. We next simply consider two other classes of population systems, one of which has the property that the whole system can be divided into several mutually independent subsystems, and the other of which has the property that the whole system can be divided into two subsystems, with population in one of these two subsystems being able to migrate to the other whereas oppositely unable. From analysis to these simple examples we can get a rough impression on the dynamical behavior of the other more general population systems. In the last part of this section we study dynamics of ergodic population system in the case that its proliferation is not stationary.",

On the other hand, as we shall see later, if v(x, y) > 0 for all (x, y) \u2208 \u2126\u00d7\u2126 then the development of population in the whole domain \u2126 is integrative: if the initial population density N 0 (x) is not identically vanishing in \u2126 then the population will eventually spread to the whole domain \u2126 with an everywhere nonvanishing distribution N \u221e (x) determined by the migration rate function v and the total amount of the initial population M 0 = \u2126 N 0 (x)dx, regardless how the initial population is distributed in the domain \u2126 (i.e., N \u221e (x) does not depend on specific profile of the initial function N 0 (x); in particular, if N 0 (x) > 0 in a small neighborhood of a point x 0 \u2208 \u2126, then N \u221e (x) > 0 for all x \u2208 \u2126, even if N 0 (x) vanishes outside that neighborhood of x 0 ).

In this example, the whole system can be divided into two mutually dependent subsystems, one defined in the subdomain \u2126 1 and the other defined in the subdomain \u2126 2 . Clearly, dependence of the two subsystems is biased: Since there exists positive migration from the subsystem defined in the subdomain \u2126 2 to that in the subdomain \u2126 1 but there does not exist opposite-direction migration, development of population in the subdomain \u2126 2 has great influence to that in the subdomain \u2126 1 , but development of population in the subdomain \u2126 1 does not have any effect to that in the subdomain \u2126 2 .

Mathematical formulation of a such model is a linear differential-integral equation. We mainly consider the ergodic population system as defined in Definition 2.1. In the proliferation-stationary case, by using the theories of irreducible positive operators and irreducible positive semigroups, we prove that in addition to the obvious assertion that total population keeps constant, the population will finally distribute to the whole habitat domain in a fixed proportion N * uniquely determined by the migration rate function, regardless how the population is initially distributed in the habitat domain.

These models include: The migration SI model (3.1) , the migration SIR model (3.9) , and the migration SIRE model (3.15) . For the migration SI model (3.1) we have proved the following result: lim t\u2192\u221e (S(x, t), I(x, t)) = (0, M 0 N * (x)) uniformly for x \u2208 \u2126, (4.2) where S and I denote the densities of the uninfected (or susceptible) and infected populations, respectively, and N * , M 0 are as in (4.1). This means that in an ergodic population system, when an outbreak of an epidemics takes place all individuals will finally become infected, regardless where they live and initially how and where the infected individuals are distributed. Thus, in an ergodic population system as is the modern global human population system, when an outbreak of epidemics occurs, to avoid uncontrollable spread of the epidemics, segregation of infected individuals from uninfected ones is a necessary measure. For the migration SIR model (3.9) we have proved the following result: lim t\u2192\u221e (S(\u00b7, t), I(\u00b7, t), R(\u00b7, t)) = (c 1 N * , 0, c 2 N * ) in L 1 sense, where S, I and R denote the densities of the uninfected (or susceptible), the infectious, and the recovered and immune populations, respectively, N * is as in (4.1), and c 1 , c 2 are positive constants, c 1 + c 2 = M 0 . This means that if a infectious disease is not so harmful in the sense that it is not fatal (i.e., infection of the disease does not cause death of population) and infected individuals can recover and become immune of it, then when it occurs in an ergodic population system, all infected individuals will finally recover, and there is a portion of the population keeping uninfected all the time. Moreover, ergodicity ensures that the uninfected and recovered populations will both distribute to the whole habitat domain in some proportions \u03bb 1 N * and \u03bb 2 N * , respectively, where \u03bb 1 , \u03bb 2 are positive constants depending only on the initial total population M 0 while independent of the initial distribution of any of the three groups of population, such that \u03bb 1 + \u03bb 2 = 1.",

Unlike the migration SIR model mentioned above, in the SIRE model individuals in the recovered group are not completely immune to the disease; they can be infected with the disease again in a suitable percentage or after a certain period of recovery, so that the susceptible group includes both individuals who are never infected and those who have recovered from infection but have lost immunity. Due to mathematical difficulties our results of analysis to this model is not very satisfactory: We have only proved that there exist constants 0 < r * \u2264 r * < \u221e such that if the infection rate 0 < r < r * then lim t\u2192\u221e (S(x, t), I(x, t), R(x, t)) = (M 0 N * (x), 0, 0) uniformly for x \u2208 \u2126, where S and I denote the densities of the susceptible, the infected and the recovered populations, respectively, and N * , M 0 are as in (4.1), i.e., if the infection rate is sufficiently small then the population system will finally become free of the epidemics, and if r > r * then there exists a stationary state in which all the three groups of population has non-identically vanishing densities (S r (x), I r (x), R r (x)), S r (x) + I r (x) + R r (x) = M 0 N * (x), such that lim t\u2192\u221e (S(x, t), I(x, t), R(x, t)) = (S r (x), I r (x), R r (x)) uniformly for x \u2208 \u2126, if the initial population densities S 0 (x), I 0 (x), R 0 (x) are sufficiently closed to S r (x), I r (x), R r (x), respectively.",
