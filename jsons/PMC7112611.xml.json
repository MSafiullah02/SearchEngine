As with all studies of this type we have only been able to assess what people say that they will do rather than what they will do in practice. However, we see no reason why those contacted would deliberately under report their EDs response.

Pulmonary TB was chosen as a marker of preparedness in light of its increasing prevalence and the emergence of multiple drug-resistant TB. National guidelines have been available for some time regarding the management of multiple drug-resistant TB12 and are currently being reviewed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE),13 although specific guidance about the isolation of patients in the ED has not been included. Specific questions regarding SARS were asked as we sought to determine how recent guidance from the Health Protection Agency for the management of SARS14 had been implemented in practice. The SARS guidance at the time stated that patients should be managed by appropriately protected staff in an isolation setting with an independent ventilation system and with a separate access from the main ED or Medical Assessment Unit (MAU). Any future influenza pandemic is likely to present in a similar way to SARS and similar precautions are advocated for cases of avian influenza.15\n",

The Health Protection Agency has prepared educational material and training courses to improve the ability of health care workers from a variety of backgrounds to deal with biological incidents.18 However, these must be delivered to all front line staff, especially triage nurses in EDs, so that they can identify the effects of at least some of the most likely biological agents. A nationally funded training standard, the Structured Approach to Chemical Casualties course, has previously been successfully cascaded down to all EDs to improve preparedness for chemical incidents.19, 20 Once a biological incident is identified, be it natural, accidental or deliberate, a wider range of issues must be managed.21\n",
