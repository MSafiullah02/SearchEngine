Subsequently, the resulting glutathione S-conjugate is converted to a cysteinylglycine S-conjugate by -glutamyltransferase (GGT) and thence to a cysteine S-conjugate by either aminopeptidase N (APN) or cysteinylglycine dipeptidase (cysteinylglycinase) or possibly leucyl aminopeptidase. Finally, the cysteine S-conjugate is N-acetylated to the corresponding N-acetyl-L-cysteine S-conjugate (mercapturate).

Phase I transformations serve to unmask a functional group and may involve reactions such as oxidation, hydrolysis, and reduction. Phase II transformations generate highly polar derivatives (conjugates), such as glucuronides and sulfate esters, which are excreted into the urine. Almost all these transformations are catalyzed by transferases (Cole and Deeley 2006) . It was originally thought that phase II reactions complete the processes begun by phase I transformations. Others have suggested that elimination of the glutathione S-conjugate from the cell may represent a phase III detoxication event (Ishikawa 1992) . It is now apparent that many xenobiotics are metabolized entirely by pathways that do not involve phase I reactions. Thus, many glutathione S-conjugates are formed from drugs and other xenobiotics without prior transformation. Moreover, glutathione S-conjugates are rarely excreted by the kidney because of their large size and amphiphilic character, and the presence of GGT and dipeptidases in the proximal tubules. Glutathione S-conjugates are often excreted into the bile Marchand et al. 1988; Silverman 1992 ) and/or further metabolized, especially to the mercapturate.

GSTs may also be broadly classified on the basis of their cellular location, namely microsomal, mitochondrial, and cytosolic (Hayes et al. 2005) .

The -glutamyl group of the substrate is transiently bound to the enzyme and the reaction proceeds through a modified ping-pong mechanism (Keillor et al. 2005) . In the human enzyme, arginine 107 and aspartate 423 are implicated in binding the -carboxylate and -amino group, respectively, of the -glutamyl moiety (Ikeda et al. 1995a ). Cleavage of the -glutamyl bond releases the glutamyl donor as the first reaction product. The -glutamyl group is released from the enzyme when the enzyme:glutamyl complex reacts with either a water molecule, yielding glutamate, or with the -amine of an amino acid (transferase or transpeptidase reaction), yielding a -glutamyl amino acid (Taniguchi and Ikeda 1998) . The -amine of a free amino acid or a dipeptide can serve as an acceptor for theglutamyl group (Thompson and Meister 1977) . The enzyme is routinely assayed by the development of a yellow color upon the release of pnitroanaline from -glutamyl-p-nitroanalide. The addition of an acceptor such as glycylglycine in a large excess (10-to 40-fold excess relative to the substrate concentration) accelerates the rate of the reaction. The standard biochemical assay is conducted at pH 8.5, the pH optimum of the transferase reaction. Analysis of the kinetics of the reaction indicated that, in the kidney, the hydrolysis reaction predominates under physiological conditions due to the reduced pH in the proximal tubule and the rapid removal of amino acids (Curthoys and Hughey 1979) . The essential nature of this reaction was established with the development of GGT knockout strains of mouse (Lieberman et al. 1996) . GGT-null mice were born at expected ratios with no apparent phenotypic abnormalities. However, they excreted high levels of GSH in their urine, failed to grow at the same rate as their wild-type littermates, and died by 10 weeks of age from a cysteine deficiency. GGT-null mice can be rescued by supplementing them with N-acetyl cysteine. Earlier work with cultured cell lines had shown that expression of GGT enabled cells to initiate the release of cysteine from extracellular GSH . GSH cannot be taken up intact by most cells. In the knockout mice, GSH present in the glomerular filtrate passes intact through the proximal tubules and is excreted into the urine (Lieberman et al. 1996) . In wild-type mice, GGT localized to the apical surface of the proximal tubules cleaves the -glutamyl bond releasing glutamate and cysteinylglycine. The cysteinylglycine dipeptide can be cleaved into cysteine and glycine by any of several dipeptidases present on the apical surface of the proximal tubule cells (Section 4.17.2.3).

The new gene named GGT-rel cleaved the -glutamyl bond of LTC 4 (a glutathione S-conjugate) but did not cleave the -glutamyl substrates routinely used to assay GGT activity. The nucleotide sequence revealed 39.5% identity between the amino acid sequences of GGT and GGT-rel.

The rat enzyme is glycosylated, but the human kidney enzyme apparently is not (Campbell et al. 1984) .

This selectivity has allowed Tate and coworkers to estimate that about 65, 60, and 95% of S-methyl-cysteinylglycine hydrolyzing activities of the rat renal, jejunal, and epididymal membranes are due to cysteinylglycine dipeptidase (reviewed in Tate 1989) .

Cysteine S-conjugates and mercapturates that are formed in the liver are excreted by the kidneys and therefore their metabolism involves interorgan transport. The following general discussion applies mainly to the rat. However, as noted above, other mammals, such as guinea pigs and humans, have much higher levels of hepatic GGT (Hinchman and Ballatori 1990; Hinchman et al. 1991 Hinchman et al. , 1993 , and therefore metabolic pathways and trafficking of mercapturate intermediates may vary from species to species. We begin with an overview of inter-organ transport followed by a discussion of specific glutathione S-conjugate-transport proteins. Although some transport of glutathione S-conjugates may occur across the sinusoidal membranes (e.g., Inoue et al. 1984a,b) , the major route for the removal of these compounds in rat liver is via canicular transporters into the bile (e.g., Akerboom et al. 1991; Hinchman et al. 1998; Keppler and K\u00f6nig 2000; Vore 1993) . The importance of the biliary excretion system is underscored by experiments in which 1-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) is administered to experimental animals. ANIT is a hepatotoxicant that induces portal edema, parenchymal necrosis, and inflammation of the bile duct epithelium. ANIT reacts reversibly with GSH. The conjugate is released to the bile where the reverse reaction results in bile duct damage and increased GSH concentration (Jean et al. 1995) . A number of compounds, including isothiocyanates and isocyanates (e.g., methylisocyanate, the compound responsible for the Bhopal tragedy), can react reversibly with GSH and thereby be disposed throughout the body (Baillie and Kassahun 1994) . Biliary cannulation protects rats from the nephrotoxic effects of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene and p-aminophenol (Gartland et al. 1990; Nash et al. 1984) .

Therefore, it is possible that although glutathione S-conjugates are usually made preferentially in the liver, some may be made elsewhere in the body. Indeed, for several xenobiotics a major site for cysteine S-conjugate formation appears to be the kidney (Hassal et al. 1984; Kanhai et al. 1989; ). The glutathione S-conjugates released to the circulation from the liver, gut, and other organs or generated directly in the kidney may be further processed in the kidney. The kidneys efficiently remove GSH and glutathione S-conjugates from the circulation by filtration ($25%) and by basolateral uptake ($75%) (Schrenk et al. 1988 ). Glutathione S-conjugates transported in the blood are generally too small to be retained by the glomerulus and enter the proximal tubules as part of the glomerular filtrate. Glutathione S-conjugates produced by the renal tubule cells can also be excreted into the lumen of the tubule (Kramer et al. 1987) . The glutathione S-conjugate is metabolized at the brush-border membranes by GGT and APN/dipeptidase (Hughey et al. 1978; Jones et al. 1979) . In this process the glutamate is released to generate a cysteine S-conjugate and glycine (Curthoys and Hughey 1979) . The cysteine S-conjugates produced in the tubules (and S-conjugates arising from tissues other than kidney reaching the tubular lumen via glomerular filtration) may be transported into the renal epithelial cells from the glomerular filtrate by active and passive uptake mechanisms (Anders 2004) . Both Na \u00fe -dependent and Na \u00fe -independent transporters have been implicated in the renal uptake of S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-Lcysteine (DCVC) (e.g., Anders 2004; Lash and Anders 1989; Schaeffer and Stevens 1987a,b) . Most of these studies have focused on uptake of DCVC across the basolateral (peritubular) membrane of the renal proximal cells (Wright et al. 1998) . Wright et al. (1998) showed that DCVC is taken up by a Na \u00fedependent transport system in isolated renal brush-border membrane vesicles (Wright et al. 1998) .

Thus, glutathione S-conjugate secretion plays a useful role in liver osmoregulation. However, as noted in several places throughout this chapter, some glutathione S-conjugates (e.g., those derived from halogenated alkenes) are toxic to the kidneys, liver, and other organs. We suggest that the hepatotoxicity may result in part from damage to the biliary system resulting from conversion of the glutathione S-conjugate to the cysteine S-conjugate followed by release of a toxic fragment by the action of cysteine S-conjugate -lyases (see Section 4.17.6 for a discussion of the cysteine S-conjugate -lyases and their role in bioactivation). Awasthi et al. (2003) showed that RLIP76, a 76-kDa Ral-binding, Rho/Rac-GAP and Ral effector protein is a transporter of several xenobiotics and glutathione S-conjugates. RLIP bears no homology to the ABC transporters. Glutathione S-conjugates of lipid peroxidation products are transported by RLIP76. The authors suggest that the transporter plays an important role as a resistance mechanism for preventing apoptosis caused by chemotherapeutic agents and a variety of external/internal stressors, including oxidative stress, heat shock, and radiation (Awasthi et al. 2003) .

As noted above, cysteine S-conjugates are also substrates of rat kidney GTK. Interestingly, L-selenocysteine Se-conjugates are more active aminotransferase and -lyase substrates of rat kidney GTK than are the corresponding cysteine S-conjugates, in most cases by an order of magnitude or more (Commandeur et al. 2000) . As a consequence, GTK has been suggested to be a possible target for selenium-containing chemopreventive drugs (Commandeur et al. 2000) . L-Glutamine is the major amino acid substrate in vivo. The product of glutamine transamination (i.e., -ketoglutaramate; KGM) is rapidly removed by cyclization to a lactam and/or conversion to -ketoglutarate in a reaction catalyzed by !-amidase. Transamination is therefore 'pulled' in the direction of glutamine utilization.

These effects may be attributable to formation of metabolites derived from a -lyase reaction since, as mentioned above, AOA can partially protect against DCVC toxicity in renal tissues and in renal cells in culture. Mechanisms by which metabolites of DCVC and other nephrotoxic haloalkene cysteine S-conjugates alter thiol status may involve direct inhibition of glutathione reductase (Lock and Schnellmann 1990) and generation of oxidative stress that leads indirectly to oxidation of thiol compounds (Chen et al. 1990 ). Oxidation of DCVC to DCVC sulfoxide followed by formation of a glutathione S-conjugate resulting from the reaction of DCVC sulfoxide with GSH may also lead to oxidative stress (Lash et al. 1994; Sausen and Elfarra 1991) . Other studies lead us to suggest an additional possibility, namely that oxidative stress may result in part from Michael addition of thiols to aminoacrylate generated in the -lyase reaction. In experiments in which LLC-PK 1 cells were exposed to DCVC, loss of nonprotein thiols was about 40-60% (Chen et al. 1990 ). Interestingly, the authors suggested that depletion of nonprotein thiols to this extent was insufficient to kill the cells. As cited earlier, BTC is relatively nontoxic, despite the fact that it is metabolized in vivo via cysteine S-conjugate -lyases (Elfarra and Hwang 1990) . We are unaware of any studies on GSH status in renal cells/ tissue resulting from exposure to BTC. Evidently, even if GSH is depleted in renal cells exposed to BTC, this insult may not be sufficient to induce overt toxicity. The implication of the work by Chen et al. (1990) is that in order for a cysteine S-conjugate to exhibit toxicity, it must generate reactive sulfur-containing fragments that covalently add to macromolecules.

A major contributing factor is likely to be the very large surface area of the renal proximal tubules coupled to the extraordinary high renal vascular perfusion. In humans, the kidneys represent 0.4% of the body weight, but receive 25% of the cardiac output (Pfaller and Gstraunthaler 1998) ; the cortex receives 95% of the renal blood flow.

The importance of mitAspAT as a cysteine S-conjugate -lyase in the bioactivation of TFEC is underscored by the work of Bruschi and coworkers. Bruschi et al. (1993) showed that six kidney mitochondrial proteins are thioacylated after rats are acutely administered a high dose of TFEC. No thioacylation of cytosolic proteins was detected. The six proteins were identified as HSP60, mitHSP70, mitAspAT, aconitase, the E 2 k (dihydrolipoamide succinyl transferase) enzyme component of the KGDHC, the E 3 (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase) enzyme component of KGDHC, and the E 3 enzyme component of the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKADHC) (Bruschi et al. , 1994 (Bruschi et al. , 1998 James et al. 2002) . Lock and Schnellmann (1990) had previously reported that metabolites of haloalkene cysteine S-conjugates (DCVC, TFEC, PCBC) inhibited dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E 3 ). Our findings that mitAspAT catalyzes a -lyase reaction with TFEC in vitro and is syncatalytically inactivated in the process (Cooper et al. 2002b ) is consistent with the in vivo finding that this enzyme in kidney is thioacylated after administration of TFEC to rats. We also showed that a high-M r -lyase present in kidney copurifies with HSP70 (Cooper et al. 2001) . As cited earlier, the high-M r -lyase in rat kidney mitochondria contains mitAspAT. This finding provides a mechanism for the thioacylation of kidney mitHSP70 in rats administered TFEC.

Moreover, the specific activity of KGDHC, but not that of PDHC, is diminished in the kidneys of TFEC-treated rats (Bruschi et al. 1998) . We have found that KGDHC, but not PDHC, is directly inhibited in PC12 cells exposed to 1 m mol l \u00c01 TFEC (Park et al. 1999) . These findings are remarkable because E 3 is a common component of KGDHC, PDHC, and BCKADHC (and the glycine cleavage system). In the presence of TFEC and purified GTK (a source of thioacylating moieties), purified PDHC is more resistant to in vitro inactivation than is purified KGDHC (Park et al. 1999) . Moreover, there is some evidence that E 3 enzyme components are bound to the complex via E 2 enzyme components in PDHC, whereas E 3 enzyme components are bound to the complex via E 1 enzyme components in KGDHC (McCartney et al. 1998) . Thus, part of the resistance of PDHC to thioacylation/inactivation in kidney mitochondria of TFEC-treated rats may be due to differences in the arrangement of its constituent enzymes. In addition, PDHC is not associated with any aminotransferases/-lyases, whereas KGDHC is closely associated with mitAspAT.

However, the renal proximal tubule cells are well-differentiated, nondividing cells that are not killed by other DNAdamaging agents (Hanigan and Devarajan 2003) . Evidence has been presented that damage to kidney cells is due to conversion of cisplatin to its glutathione S-conjugate and subsequently to its cysteine S-conjugate. The cysteine S-conjugate is then bioactivated by cysteine S-conjugate -lyase(s) to generate a fragment containing a Pt-SH moiety. This Pt-SH fragment is proposed to react with macromolecules at thiophilic centers (Zhang and Hanigan 2003;  Figure 7) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 301, "text": "Zhang and Hanigan 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 529, "end": 557, "text": "(Hanigan and Devarajan 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 940, "end": 964, "text": "(Zhang and Hanigan 2003;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 965, "end": 965, "text": "", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 966, "end": 975, "text": "Figure 7)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Toxic Homocysteine S-Conjugates"}, {"text": "After mice were treated with cisplatin, proteins in kidney mitochondria were more platinated than proteins in the cytosolic fraction (Zhang et al. 2006) .

The strong electron-withdrawing properties of the -OS(O 2 )CH 3 group on busulfan (I) results in electron deficiency at each carbon adjacent to the two methanesulfonyl groups. This deficiency facilitates the nucleophilic attack of the sulfhydryl of GSH at one of these carbons, resulting in elimination of methanesulfonate (II) and subsequent generation of adduct III. This step occurs nonenzymatically but is accelerated by GSTs. The electron deficiency in the remaining carbon adjacent to the -OS(O 2 )CH 3 group in adduct III facilitates nonenzymatic intramolecular nucleophilic attack at this carbon by a pair of electrons on the sulfur of the thioether, generating the glutathione S-conjugate (V) and eliminating a second equivalent of methanesulfonate. The conjugate (V) possesses a cyclic sulfonium group. GGT (a) and dipeptidases (b) possess broad specificities. Thus, V is expected to be readily converted to the corresponding cysteine S-conjugate THT-A (VI). VI may also be formed by nonenzymatic nucleophilic attack of a cysteine sulfur on busulfan (I), which generates adduct IV and methanesulfonate, followed by intramolecular cyclization and elimination of a second equivalent of methanesulfonate. VI contains a strong electron-withdrawing group and is therefore expected to undergo a facile -elimination reaction to yield THT (VII), ammonium (VIII), and pyruvate (IX). This reaction occurs nonenzymatically at pH 7.4, but is accelerated by PLP and by rat liver cystathionine -lyase (and by other as yet unrecognized enzymes in rat tissues). THT (VII) may also be generated directly and nonenzymatically from -E-THT-AG (V) by an elimination reaction that results in the formation of -glutamyldehydroalanylglycine (X). The conversion of busulfan (I) to the conjugate (V) is shown as occurring in two consecutive steps, but may occur by a concerted mechanism.

For example, DCVC sulfoxide is more toxic than DCVC. The potential exists for the cysteine S-conjugate sulfoxide to undergo an elimination reaction to generate a reactive sulfenic acid. However, there is no evidence that this occurs in the case of DCVC sulfoxide.

If the eliminated sulfurcontaining fragment is not especially reactive the parent cysteine S-conjugate may not be particularly toxic. The sulfur-containing fragment may be thiomethylated or S-glucuronidated and excreted. Alternatively, the fragment may be further oxidized to a sulfoxide or sulfone before excretion.

However, as we have documents above, the pathway may sometimes be a 'double-edged sword.' On the one hand, the mercapturate pathway is a defense mechanism to rid the body of potentially noxious xenobiotics. On the other hand, each of the various S-conjugates derived from halogenated alkenes within the mercapturate pathway are toxic as a result of bioactivation of the cysteine S-conjugate by cysteine S-conjugate -lyases.
