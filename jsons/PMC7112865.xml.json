According to the American Heart Association, more than 1 million people suffer a heart attack each year and approximately 795,000 suffer a stroke. These diseases significantly contribute to the mortality rate and full recovery is unlikely, with the single most important factor being the degree of ischaemic damage at the time of the event. Ischaemia refers to a reduction in blood flow and reperfusion injury is associated with an initial blood-borne neutrophil infiltration, giving rise to an inflammatory response and finally resulting in tissue injury 1, 2, 3.",

Although a great deal of damage occurs to the tissue because of reperfusion, a significant amount of injury occurs due to ischaemia itself. During myocardial injury, several events occur that mediate vascular injury, including oxygen free radical production by mitochondrial respiration, activated neutrophils and xanthine oxidase activity [3]. These are all intimately involved in the inflammatory cascade, themselves activating leukocytes, inducing lipid peroxidation and increasing vascular permeability.",

These factors mediate the inflammatory cascade, involving leukocyte rolling, adhesion and transendothelial migration 3, 4 (Figure 1). Numerous receptors modulate the host inflammatory response.

On the basis of current understanding of I/R, several potential treatments have been suggested based on mechanical (e.g. coronary angioplasty or stenting) or pharmacological (e.g. anti-platelet therapy, tissue plasminogen activator administration, neutralization of already secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines, administration of anti-inflammatory cytokines, factors favouring mesenchymal stem cell implantation and mobilization) restoration of blood flow 2, 6, 7. Other therapeutic approaches have been explored such as targeting of receptors implicated in regulating and resolving the inflammation associated with I/R. One such family of receptors is the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) known as the formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), whose involvement in I/R injury has been demonstrated in a variety of different tissues, and thus ligands for FPRs might play a role in host defense.",

            "text": "The FPRs are promiscuous in their ability to bind different ligands, such as formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and lipoxin A4 (LXA4) (Box 1\n, Table 2\n). However, the receptors are expressed in different cells and tissues, raising the possibility that FPRs have far more diverse and complex roles in biology. Interestingly, resolution of inflammation involves the formation of endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators, which signals the termination of recruitment and removal of inflammatory cells from the inflammatory locus [8]. In this review, I summarise the evidence for proposing FPR ligands as novel anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving therapeutics and focus on their role in reducing the detrimental effects associated with I/R injury.Box 1FPR signalling and nomenclatureFPR signallingLeukocyte responses to chemoattractants, such as fMLP, require binding and activation of pertussin-toxin-sensitive GPCR coupling to Gi\u03b12 or Gi\u03b13, which triggers multiple second messengers through phospholipase C (PLC), PLD and PLA2 activation [8]. fMLP stimulation of leukocytes induces shape changes, chemotaxis, adhesion, phagocytosis and the release of superoxide anions and granule contents, leading to tissue damage, as observed in inflammation and infarction [86]. All major neutrophil functions stimulated by fMLF can be inhibited by treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, indicating that the FPRs belong to the Gi family of heterotrimeric G proteins [11].All three human FPRs are clustered on chromosomal region 19q13.3 [11], whereas the murine equivalents are arranged in two clusters on chromosome 17 (A3.2) together with an additional pseudogene (\u03a8Fpr2) [18] based not on receptor structure, but on receptor agonists (Table 2).FPR nomenclature\nHuman:\nTable 1 demonstrates human FPR nomenclature 11, 19. FPR2/ALX shares 69% sequence homology with FPR1. Both FPR2/ALX and FPR3 possess high degrees of amino acid identity (69%) 15, 20, but are activated by different ligands (Table 2). The FPR3 gene encodes a putative protein with 56% amino acid similarity to FPR1 and 72% to FPR2/ALX.\nNon-human: A high degree of specificity to human orthologue genes occurs in non-human primates (95\u201399%) [11]. The situation is complicated in mice, with gene clusters having undergone differential expansion. The mouse genome encodes for at least seven different receptors (Table 1). It is now agreed that murine Fpr1 is 77% identical to human FPR1 [11] and Fpr3 is 76% identical to human FPRL2. Fpr2 binds fMLF with low affinity 11, 18. Fpr-r3, 4, 6 and 7 seem to have no direct counterparts in the human genome [73]. Fpr-rs4 encodes a receptor with a short COOH-terminal domain, whereas Fpr-rs5 has a stop codon in the putative transmembrane domain 6 (more likely to be a pseudogene) [73]. Two additional genes were characterised from screening of a mouse BAC genomic library, termed Fpr-rs6 and Fpr-rs7\n[105]. Other orthologues have been found at a molecular level in species such as rabbit and primates and at a functional level in rat [106], guinea pig and horse (as reviewed in [11]).It is noteworthy that there is chemoattractant receptor-like molecule (CRTH2) from a human Th2 clone that has high amino-acid homology with members of the FPR family. However, the similarity is insufficient to classify CRTH2 as an FPR member.",

[14] used primary microglia cells to demonstrate expression of FPR1 and FPR2/ALX genes; on stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), these cells undergo FPR2/ALX-mediated activation, leading to the suggestion that the blood brain barrier (BBB), under normal conditions, protects microglial cells. When endotoxaemia occurs, however, microvessels form an incomplete BBB and LPS is able to stimulate microglial cells, which assume macrophage characteristics and thus play a role in the inflammatory process [16]. Increased inflammatory events, such as leukocyte rolling and adhesion, occur in the murine cerebral microcirculation after endotoxaemia (something not observed under normal conditions) and seem to be mediated by FPR2/ALX (Gavins et al., unpublished observations). The increase in inflammatory events such as leukocyte rolling and adhesion observed following endotoxaemia also occurs during stroke. The role of FPR2/ALX in stroke is of great interest to my research team and the importance of this receptor as a potential therapeutic target is currently being investigated. The role of the FPRs in cerebral I/R is discussed in more detail later in this review.",

Several natural formylated peptides have been purified from bacterial supernatants and exhibit the ability to activate human leukocytes [17]. fMLP is a widely used agonist of the FPR family and binds to FPR1 with approximately 1000-fold higher affinity than FPR2/ALX (K\nd values in the picomolar to low nanomolar range), resulting in calcium mobilization and neutrophil activation [18]. Evidence suggests that FPR1 and FPR2/ALX activate the same signal response downstream of the receptor, resulting from activation produced by different ligands 11, 19. FPR2/ALX is a low-affinity receptor for fMLP (K\nd 430 nM) 11, 20 that produces a chemotactic response at micromolar concentrations. (FPR3 has a K\nd value of \u223c10 \u03bcM [21]). LXA4 also interacts with FPR2/ALX (K\nd \u223c0.5 nM) 22, 23, inhibiting the pro-inflammatory responses induced by both FPR2/ALX ligands in neutrophils and non-FPR2/ALX ligands in epithelial cell lines 23, 24, 25.

Other synthetic peptides such as His-Phe-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Met-NH2 (HFYLPM) stimulate both monocytes and neutrophils via FPR2/ALX binding [32]. The peptide fragment of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (MYFINILTL) is an agonist specific for FPR2/ALX. Other recent screening studies include a 152 GPCR screen that identified a novel 21-amino-acid peptide agonist of FPR2/ALX and FPR3 termed CGEN-855A (TIPMFVPESTSKLQKFTSWFM-amide) [33] and a screen for unique non-peptide agonists of FPR1/FPR2/ALX [33].

In particular, targets activated by endogenous anti-inflammatory mediators could be used for drug discovery for both I/R and other disease states because they are likely to have fewer side effects and their application would be similar to mechanisms that the body uses to reject inflammation [60]. One particular endogenous ligand of interest is the 37-kDa protein AnxA1, whose involvement with the FPR family has been widely studied and which affords protection in a number of I/R models. Initially, cardioprotection by AnxA1 was observed in rat myocardial I/R injury [64]. It was not until 2001, however, that La et al. [53] investigated the mechanistic and molecular basis of AnxA1 action and demonstrated that the pharmacophore responsible for cardioprotection lies within amino acids 2\u201312, with correct alignment being crucial [53]. A clinical application was hypothesised on the basis of cardioprotection being retained by the AnxA1 N-terminal peptide Ac2\u201326 (also termed AnxA1Ac2\u201326) when administered 60 min into reperfusion [53]. Boc2 administration demonstrated for the first time that FPRs are involved in the cardioprotective properties of AnxA1. Histology demonstrated that neutrophil influx into the myocardium induces AnxA1 expression, which was absent in sham and na\u00efve animals.",

The actual contribution of resident cells versus blood-borne cells has yet to be fully quantified and might explain why clinical trials targeting one specific aspect of the inflammatory cascade have failed. A neuroprotective role for AnxA1, mediated via FPRs, has been demonstrated in studies using a middle cerebral artery occlusion model combined with IVM to quantify cerebral cellular interactions following stroke [54]. Peptide AnxA1Ac2\u201326 decreased infarct volume, leukocyte adhesion and markers of inflammation. Microglia might, in part, contribute to these inflammatory responses [54]. Both blood cells and microglia express mouse Fpr2, which might have mediated the effects of peptide AnxA1Ac2\u201326 in this study. Further studies are being performed to validate this theory, with current data suggesting that microglial cell inhibition reduces brain inflammation post-I/R (Gavins and Perretti, unpublished data). Figure 2\ndemonstrates how AnxA1 could act in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion with the members of the FPR family to reduce inflammation by (i) causing detachment of leukocytes within the microvasculature and (ii) inhibiting the production of cytotoxic proinflammatory mediators by activated microglial cells, both of which are thought to play a role in cerebrovascular events such as stroke [54].",

The promiscuity of these receptors in binding different ligands, coupled with their presence in different cells and tissue, indicates a diverse role in multiple biological settings. Improved understanding of these fundamental functions would instruct therapeutic target identification and drug development. Thus, further study of endogenous anti-inflammatory agonists, such as AnxA1, and the lipoxins could lead to the identification and development of better therapeutics capable of limiting the detrimental effects of I/R injury and promoting resolution, with fewer side effects.",

Neutrophils are activated after I/R injury. They roll, adhere and migrate into the tissue. AnxA1 is released from neutrophil cytosolic granules to the cell surface, where it interacts with FPRs in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Administration of AnxA1 (or the N-terminal peptide Ac2\u201326) causes the leukocyte detachment from endothelial cells. Resident cells, such as microglia, are also activated by I/R injury and, like blood-borne cells, release a plethora of damaging mediators such as reactive oxygen species, cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and leukotrienes. The involvement of AnxA1 in these processes might be similar to that observed in the peripheral microvasculature, namely to promote resolution. The receptors that mediate this process in stroke remain unknown, although evidence suggests that FPR/ALX plays a role.",
