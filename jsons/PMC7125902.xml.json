In the study done by Kantor [15] he found the patterns of lobar pneumonia and bronchopneumonia were equally frequent in pneumococcal pneumonia. The radiographic findings of Legionella consist of segmental peripheral consolidations, there may also be lobar involvement, and bilateral disease is seen in more than half of the patients [16]. Viral pneumonia has a radiologic pattern consisting of poorly defined air-space nodules of 4\u201310 mm, patchy areas of peribronchial ground glass opacity, and air-space consolidation. Hyperinflation is also commonly present because of the associated bronchiolitis. Pneumonia could progress as seen by the rapid confluence of consolidation leading to diffuse alveolar damage, which consists of homogenous or patchy unilateral or bilateral air-space consolidation and ground-glass opacity or poorly defined centrilobular nodules [17]. The predominant radiographic patterns in H1N1 pneumonia are bilateral ground glass opacity and alveolar consolidation [18]. Striking characteristic of S. pneumonia is its tendency to involve the pleura, parapneumonic effusions are common in Pneumococcal pneumonia\n[19]. In the study conducted by Ali Khawaja et al. [20] they found that the most common chest X ray finding in patient with CAP was lobar consolidation in (63%) followed by pleural effusion in (37%) and interstitial infiltrates in (28%). In another study by Seksan et al. [21] they found that the most common pulmonary infiltration pattern of X-ray in patients with CAP was patchy infiltrates in (69.3%), followed by interstitial infiltrations in (22.2%), diffuse alveolar infiltrations in (5.0%) and multilobar infiltrations in (3.5%).",

No bacterial growth occurred in 24%. P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia, E. coli and A. baumannii were predominantly present in patients with comorbidities, which can be explained by airway colonization by these organisms, also Influenza H1N1 is considered high because our study was done mainly during winter season. In the study done by Boixeda et al. [22], they found that the most frequently isolated microorganism in patients with comorbidities and COPD was P. aeruginosa in 27 (30.7%), followed by S. pneumoniae in 23 (26.1%), Enterobacteriaceae in 18 (20.4%), H. influenza in 14 cases (15.9%), and finally M. catarrhalis in 6 (6.8%). In another study done File [4] he found that the most common causes of severe pneumonia are S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, Legionella spp. Gram-negative bacilli and H. influenza.",
