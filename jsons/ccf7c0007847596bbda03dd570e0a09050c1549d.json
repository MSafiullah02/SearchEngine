Worldwide case fatality rate is 11% (range 7 to 27%) for the most severely affected regions. Several adverse prognostic factors have been identified, including advanced age, presence of comorbidity, higher lactose dehydrogenase levels and initial neutrophil count, but the impact of viral and other host factors on outcome is unknown. Published data on sequelae of SARS are limited. Clinical follow-up of patients who recovered from SARS has demonstrated radiological, functional and psychological abnormalities of varying degrees. In the early rehabilitation phase, many complained of limitations in physical function from general weakness and/or shortness of breath. In a small series of subjects who underwent CT scan of the chest, over half showed some patchy changes consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. Lung function testing at 6-8 weeks after hospital discharge showed mild or moderate restrictive pattern consistent with muscle weakness in 6-20% of subjects. Mild decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity was detected in a minority of subjects. Preliminary evidence suggests that these lung function abnormalities will improve over time. Psychobehavioural problems of anxiety and/or depression were not uncommon in the early recovery phase, and improved over time in the majority of patients. Avascular necrosis of the hip has been reported as another complication. The long-term sequelae of SARS are still largely unknown.

Several studies have reported on short-term outcomes in adult patients up to about one month of the onset of illness. Various outcome measures have been examined, including admission to intensive care unit (ICU), development of acute lung injury (ALI), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality. About one-third of patients have prompt resolution of fever and pneumonitis with treatment 2 and even without specific treatment in a minority. However, the remaining run a much more stormy course -19 to 34% of SARS patients required admission to ICU, 13 to 26% required assisted ventilation, 20 to 22.6% developed ALI or ARDS and 3.6 to 10.1% died at day 21 to day 28. (Table 1 ). [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Protracted ventilation is not uncommon for SARS-induced respiratory failure. 9 This has posed considerable strain on critical care resources in the affected regions. Even with vigorous support and treatment, half of those who required mechanical ventilation eventually died. 9 The reported mortality in ICU was 34% at 28 days 8 and 52.2% at 13 weeks. 9 As the SARS epidemic abates, a clearer picture of the mortality of the disease is emerging. The most recent WHO update 1 indicated that the worldwide case fatality rate (CFR) is 11% and ranged from 7 to 27% for the most severely affected regions (Table 2) . Most deaths were attributed to complications related to sepsis, ARDS and multiorgan failure, 8 which occurred commonly in the elderly with comorbidities. There were notable differences in case-mix among different regions (i.e. differences in distribution of age, sex, disease severity as reflected by surrogate markers such as LDH level, proportion of infected healthcare workers (HCW) and the proportion of SARS confirmed by virological tests). The CFR of HCW in Hong Kong was 2% (8 out of 386). It is noteworthy that in the United States, only 8 out of 47 probable cases and none of the 162 suspected cases have had virological confirmation of SARS-CoV infection. 10 The variation in CFR across different regions has to be interpreted in the light of these differences. 11", "cite_spans": [{"start": 867, "end": 870, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 871, "end": 874, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 875, "end": 878, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 879, "end": 882, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 883, "end": 886, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 887, "end": 890, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 891, "end": 894, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 895, "end": 898, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 976, "end": 977, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1175, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1251, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1604, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2178, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 855, "end": 863, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1507, "text": "(Table 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "OUTCOMES"}, {"text": "Prognostic factors examined were essentially patient characteristics and laboratory findings. Few studies reported prognosis in relation to drug treatment, and little is known about the differences in host response caused by SARS-coronavirus. Age and comorbidity (e.g. diabetes mellitus, heart disease) were consistently found to be significant independent predictors of various adverse outcomes in SARS. Initial experience suggests that children with SARS have better prognosis than adults. 12, 13 Three studies reported that LDH level (two on the initial LDH level 2,5 and one on the peak LDH level 3 ) was a predictive factor. Two studies reported the initial neutrophil count 2,3 and one study reported the initial CD4, CD8 count 5 as predictive of outcome. The analysis by the SARS Collaborative Group of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority on 889 patients has identified the following as risk factors for death: advanced age, male sex, presence of comorbidity, higher peak LDH level and higher initial neutrophil count. 14, 15 The mortality rate was 6% for patients aged between 25 and 44, in contrast to 60% for age over 65.

In addition, 50% of the patients from the QEH series have a decrease in hand grip strength.
