It has been noted that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in fecal matter for an extended period of time, even after respiratory samples have tested negative and patients are asymptomatic. In this article, SARS-CoV-2 and its disease COVID-19 will be reviewed with consideration of the latest literature about gastrointestinal symptomatology, the mechanisms by which the virus may inflict damage, and the possibility of viral replication contributing to a fecal-oral route of transmission.",

To date, on April 17, 2020, there have been 2,074,529 confirmed cases and 139,378 deaths globally 3 . COVID-19 is rapidly transmissible, posing a considerable threat to global public health 4 . SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain cellular entry into the lower respiratory tract of humans, which has also been noted to be highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells 1, 5 . Though patients typically endorse respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and shortness of breath, there have been numerous reported cases of diagnosed COVID-19 patients exhibiting gastrointestinal manifestations such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain 6, 7 . A study has shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in feces for up to a month in 83.3% of patients with a mild infection, raising suspicion for the gastrointestinal tract as an additional site of viral replication 8 . Additionally, another study demonstrated that out of 73 COVID-19 patients, 53.4% were found to have viral RNA present in their stool -23.3% of those patients had positive stool samples even after the viral RNA cleared from their respiratory tract 9 . As such, these characteristics have clinical implications regarding the proper management of infected individuals, a potential fecal-oral route of transmission, and effective preventative infection control.",

He eventually tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in his stool and respiratory specimens upon rRT-PCR testing 12, 13 . Additionally, the first case of hematochezia as a possible initial presenting symptom of COVID-19 was reported. Although the patient's stool specimens were not tested for viral RNA, this case highlights a rare gastrointestinal manifestation of the COVID-19 14 . Furthermore, other symptoms noted were anorexia (39.9%-50.2%), vomiting (3.6%-66.7%), nausea (1%-29.4%), abdominal pain (2.2%-6.0%), and gastrointestinal bleeding (4%-13.7%) 12 .",

Additional studies have demonstrated similar results with abnormalities in liver enzymes and total bilirubin ( Table 3) 11, 16, 18, [20] [21] [22] [23] 30, 31 . Patients with elevated liver function tests were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever, and these elevations were significantly more prevalent in male patients (68.67% vs. 38.36%). Additionally, in these patients, the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were substantially lower as compared to those with normal liver function tests 25 . Per the ACG, drops in leukocyte counts are observed in COVID-19 infection, and an elevated white blood cell count is considered a poor prognostic sign 26 . Studies have found that most liver injuries are mild and transient, but severe liver damage can also occur 27 . A higher magnitude of liver injury was noted in individuals with severe COVID-19, in which cases hepatoprotective drugs can be administered 5, 27 .",

Considerations for testing of viral RNA in feces by rRT-PCR can be taken to monitor for adequate source and infection control 34 .",

As the viral receptor ACE2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract, it may play a role in the virus's ability to dysregulate the digestive system, hepatobiliary function, and pancreatic function, thereby resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms. Of note, a majority of the information presented in this narrative review was derived from reports originating from various regions in China. Consequently, application of these findings on a global scale is limited during an evolving pandemic. Likewise, the data displayed in our tables highlight variance among similar studies. As it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can remain in stool longer than respiratory specimens, it may serve as evidence for gastrointestinal viral replication and subsequent shedding. Currently, while fecal-oral transmission has not been definitively proven, there is evidence to support its possibility, warranting the need for additional precautions.",

Lastly, druginduced hepatotoxicity may play a role in the elevation of liver enzymes, including medications such as remdesivir (an RNA polymerase inhibitor) and hydroxychloroquine5,28 .Patients with pre-existing liver disease are an important group of individuals that require additional attention. In a study of 1099 COVID-19 patients, 23 patients had hepatitis B infectionsevere cases of COVID-19 were more likely to have hepatitis B infection than non-severe cases (2.4% vs. 0.6%)29 . Furthermore, in patients with COVID-19 with autoimmune hepatitis, the role of glucocorticoids in disease management is currently unclear27 . In the setting of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), COVID-19 may aggravate cholestasis. Therefore, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transfersase (GGT) levels should carefully be monitored. Given their immunocompromised state, patients with hepatic cirrhosis or cancer may be more susceptible to COVID-19 27 . PANCREAS In a recent study by Wang et al. examining 52 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 17% of patients experienced pancreatic injury defined by any abnormality in amylase or lipase 32 . They did not exhibit clinical symptoms of severe pancreatitis, however. The ACE2 receptor is also highly J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f expressed in pancreatic islet cells, therefore SARS-CoV-2 infection can theoretically cause islet damage resulting in acute diabetes. Of the nine patients with pancreatic injury, six had abnormal blood glucose levels. Mechanisms by which pancreatic injury could occur include the direct cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2, or indirect systemic inflammatory and immune-mediated cellular responses, resulting in organ damage or secondary enzyme abnormalities 32,33 .",

It also confirmed prolonged viral RNA shedding in feces for at least two weeks and upwards of more than a month, raising suspicion that the gastrointestinal tract acts as another site of viral replication 8 . A study conducted by Xiao et al. demonstrated results favoring gastrointestinal viral replication with potential fecal-oral route of transmission 34 . Amongst 73 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China, ranging from 10 months to 78 years old, 53.42% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the stool. Positive stool results ranged from 1-12 days, and 23.29% continued to have positive stool results after having negative respiratory samples 34 . Upon endoscopy and biopsy, the study also found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected with positive staining of the viral J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f nucleocapsid protein in gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelium. These findings further support the evidence of replication of infectious virions occurring within the gastrointestinal tract 34 .",

It was also found that a positive stool test did not correlate to the severity of the lung infection.Advantages of stool testing include the possibility that it may reduce infections in medical staff compared to oropharyngeal swab specimens 35 . The definitive role of endoscopy and colonoscopy in the diagnosis of COVID-19 remains largely unclear at this point. According to the Spanish Society of Digestive Pathology and the Spanish Association of Gastroenterology, upper endoscopies, ERCP, and placement of peg tube procedures have a high risk of infection transmission; colonoscopies and lower echoendoscopies are intermediate risk 36 . The American J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy currently has similar recommendations as of March 13, 2020: endoscopy is a high-risk procedure because of the potential transmission of the virus via a fecal-oral route and the risk of transmitting COVID-19 during its incubation period in asymptomatic patients 37 . Aggressive Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) should be utilized during these procedures for adequate infection control. Apart from diagnostic tests, certain laboratory abnormalities have been noted in patients with COVID-19. In a study of 1099 confirmed COVID-19 cases from mainland China, patients exhibited lymphocytopenia (83.2%), thrombocytopenia (36.2%), and leukopenia (33.7%) on admission 18 . Based on a study involving 140 COVID-19 patients, those with severe disease were noted to have an elevated D dimer (2.0-fold), C-reactive protein (1.7-fold), procalcitonin (2.0fold), lactate dehydrogenase (2.1-fold), decreased lymphocyte count, and leukopenia as compared to individuals with milder disease 10 .",

Current treatment options remain primarily supportive including oxygen therapy, antipyretics, etc. Depending on the severity of disease, critically-ill individuals may require mechanical ventilation or hemodynamic support in cases of septic shock. In general, aggressive fluid management should be avoided in patients at risk of severe illness and with severe acute respiratory infection 28 . Systemic corticosteroids are not recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting are conservatively managed with antiemetic medications. Prior to initiating supportive care, it is recommended to perform an additional work up to rule out other infectious etiologies such as Clostridium difficile toxin assay and a gastrointestinal pathogen panel. The use of antibiotics remains controversial but recommended only if coinfection is noted. Given that patients can have positive stool results after having tested negative by nasopharyngeal samples, management should include effective infection control. Patients and their families should be notified that viral shedding may take place in the active phase of COVID-19 infection. As such, close contacts are at a heightened risk of becoming infected. Patients should be advised to practice proper hand hygiene and maintain social distancing. The reinfection rate of COVID-19 is currentlyunknown; therefore, patients should be warned that there is a possibility that it may occur and to screen for symptoms accordingly.",
