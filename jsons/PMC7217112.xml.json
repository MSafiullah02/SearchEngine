Although essential services were not closed during the lockdown, there were clear guidelines for the orthopaedic surgeons to reduce their outpatient department workflow and non-urgent surgeries.6\n,\n7 However, the orthopaedic surgeons were still not the frontline workers for care of the COVID patients as the disease had not yet overwhelmed the health services in India.8 In India the health system is in the hands of both the government and private sector. Several orthopaedic surgeons in India work only in private corporate hospitals or small hospitals of their own. Shutting down a significant part of their work and a constant threat of coronavirus in the workplace was increasing the stress levels of many physicians. Hence, we undertook an anonymous online survey of orthopaedic surgeons of the country to assess their stress levels and gain valuable information on their perspective and their response during this unique lockdown period due to COVID 19.",

A previous study on COVID 19 lockdown by Wang et al. also showed that people younger than 40 years had a higher risk of anxiety during this period.11\n",

We are expected to be in control of our professional life and our personal life.16 In this unique lockdown situation, even though the orthopaedic surgeons are not the frontline workers, their stress may be due to professional, personal and financial factors that cannot be ignored. Since the infection has steadily increased and the lockdown has been extended twice in the absence of any exit strategy, the future looks even more uncertain now. The community spread of the infection has infected several medical personnel, sometimes unknowingly and sometimes in the line of duty even after donning the full PPE. To that effect, the government regulations have been clouded in ambiguity. Several hospitals were asked to close down completely after exposure to an infected patient. Then, there were instances of FIR being filed against the doctors after they got infected during their outpatient clinic work. Although the recent orders under the ESMA (essential services maintenance act) indicated that all clinics and hospitals should remain open, the private hospitals were instructed not to ask for COVID testing for surgical patients. But the Orthopaedic surgeons are still looking after trauma work and will extend their services to active COVID care as needed. As doctors we have learned to always care for the sick, and as surgeons we are conditioned to be in leadership positions, but the fact remains that anxiety, apprehension and stress about the right course of professional action in light of the above information, continues to increase. However, we do hope that maybe if we have support groups, occasional conversations, a lot of these burdens and stress will be shared and hopefully lessened. We may be asked to work on the frontlines in due course of time, and we agree with Dyer et al. that this would be a privilege to help the society.12 These are the times when close cooperation, collaborative efforts, teamwork and open communication lines will be needed among the colleagues, with greater support to be extended to the younger members. Hopefully, soon enough we will all come out of the lockdown and the pandemic and would have endured its effect with resilience and vigor.",

Another limitation is that the non-response rate could not be calculated, and it is possible that people who were experiencing psychological symptoms were more likely to respond to the survey. The number of orthopaedic surgeons who are stressed out may change as the lockdown extends further than 3 weeks and the pandemic spreads wider. We only examined how stressed the orthopaedic surgeons were through online surveys and not a face to face questionnaire. However, since our survey was anonymous, we believe that the participants were truly honest in declaring how they were feeling.",
