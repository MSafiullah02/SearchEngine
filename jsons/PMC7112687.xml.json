Respiratory viruses are detected in the majority of exacerbation of asthma in adults (41\u201378%) and in a smaller proportion of patients with exacerbation of COPD (22\u201344%) and community acquired pneumonia (15\u201354%).4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Picornaviruses (rhinoviruses and enteroviruses) are the most frequent cause of the common cold and are also consistently the most commonly detected viruses in adults with exacerbations of asthma,4 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)5, 7 and in most studies of aetiology in community acquired pneumonia.8, 9 In addition, recent evidence suggests that respiratory viruses are associated with a significant proportion of acute respiratory disease amongst hospitalised adults and the elderly.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n",

A recent US study demonstrated that over 50% of hospital inpatients received antibiotics at some stage during their stay, with acute respiratory illness being the commonest reason for antibiotic use.14 In addition to the frequent isolation of viruses, there is also a lack of evidence of clinical benefit from antibiotic use in many acute respiratory conditions presenting to secondary care including; acute bronchitis,15 exacerbations of asthma16 and mild-moderate cases of exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease.17, 18 Widespread use of antibiotics in hospitals and the community has led to the emergence and proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria19, 20 and to increasing rates of health care associated infections (HCAIs) such as Clostridium difficile. Effective antibiotic stewardship and reduction in excess antibiotic use in hospitals has been shown to be effective in reducing antimicrobial resistance and HCAIs and has therefore become a global priority.21\n",

            "text": "The detection rate of respiratory viruses in patients with exacerbation of COPD was around 40%, which is consistent with the findings of a recent systematic review.5 Although antibiotic use was very common, occurring in around 80% of patients, bacterial detection and co-detection of viruses and bacteria together were also relatively common suggesting that viral identification in patients with exacerbation of COPD cannot be used in isolation to withhold antibiotic therapy. Although bacteria are frequently detected from patients with exacerbation of COPD their exact role and importance compared to viruses is the subject of ongoing debate. Antibiotics are currently recommended in COPD exacerbation according to clinical criteria18 however the evidence for clinical benefit in mild to moderate exacerbations is limited17, 18 and must be balanced against the risks of adverse events. Studies using the serum biomarker Procalcitonin(PCT) have demonstrated that antibiotics can be safely withheld in patients with exacerbation of COPD and low levels of PCT. Biomarker directed antibiotic use probably represent the most promising strategy currently available for reducing excess antibiotic use in this group31 and studies further evaluating this are ongoing.",

Using even these restrictive criteria, nineteen of the 82 (23%) patients with laboratory confirmed influenza in our study presented within 48 h of the onset of symptoms and should therefore have been considered for treatment.

Our results are only applicable to hospitalised adults and cannot be extrapolated to children or to patients presenting to primary care. The seasonal nature of our recruitment means that the results are only applicable to patients admitted outside of the summer months and may overestimate the overall annual incidence of respiratory viral detection in these patient groups. In addition, because the exact dates of patient recruitment were different year by year there is a potential for underestimating the prevalence of respiratory viruses with seasonal periodicity such as RSV and influenza. This may explain our relatively low rate of RSV detection compared to some other studies. Our definition of bacterial detection includes the isolation of potentially pathogenic bacteria in sputum which may overestimate the true numbers of bacterial infections as the presence of bacteria in sputum may represent colonisation rather than infection. As we did not test for M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae in our study we may have underestimated the overall proportion of bacterial detection. However the role of these organisms in clinical groups other than pneumonia and bronchitis is not established and similar studies in hospitalised adults have shown low rates of detection even when using molecular methods.13 In our cohort a large number of patients were unable to provide adequate sputum samples for analysis and culture which could have underestimated the overall rate of bacterial detection. However in our subgroup analysis of patients with complete sampling the overall rate of bacterial detection was higher in patients with COPD and pneumonia but for other groups was not significantly different. Finally, around a quarter of our patients were already taking antibiotics at the time of hospitalisation which could have led to a reduction in the detection of bacteria and so an underestimation of bacterial detection rate. However it is notable that the detection rates of bacteria in our study are consistent with other similar studies including those where patients already on antibiotics were excluded.13\n",
