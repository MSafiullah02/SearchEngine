We performed virological, pathological, and epidemiological analyses of a Dutch case, and compared the results with those of a US case. Both infections occurred in transplant patients under immunosuppressive therapy and caused fatal respiratory failure. Both virus isolates clustered with PPMV-1, which has pigeons and doves as reservoir. Experimentally inoculated pigeons became infected and transmitted the virus to naive pigeons. Both patients were likely infected by contact with infected pigeons or doves. Given the large populations of feral pigeons with PPMV-1 infection in cities, increasing urbanization, and a higher proportion of immunocompromised individuals, the risk of severe human PPMV-1 infections may increase. We recommend testing for avian paramyxovirus type 1, including PPMV-1, in respiratory disease cases where common respiratory pathogens cannot be identified.",

She lived in the country near to a city, but was not employed in agriculture, and there was no evidence of contact with animals in her clinical history. Gastroscopic examination showed no abnormalities. Infiltrative lesions in the thorax were detected by radiological and computed tomographic examinations, and there was progressive swelling of cervical lymph nodes. No pathogens were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens (virus culture on HEL, LLC-MK2, HEp-2, and human rhabdomyosarcoma cells; bacterial culture on blood agar, chocolate agar, Columbia blood agar containing colistin and nalidixic acid, and Sabouraud agar; cytological examination for bacteria, fungi, and Pneumocystis carinii), and a biopsy of the peripheral right lower lung lobe was histologically normal. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigen expression and lymphoproliferation were detected in a biopsy of the right jugular lymph node, and a blood sample was positive for EBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Reactivation of EBV and associated lymphoproliferation were treated successfully with rituximab (anti-CD20) and discontinuation of cyclosporin therapy, but other clinical signs remained. Enteroscopic examination of the small intestine showed no abnormalities, and no pathogens were detected in fecal samples by bacterial culture.",

In addition, there was marked diffuse alveolar damage, characterized by abundant hyaline membranes lining the alveolar septa. The mucosa of the colon ascendens was lined by a hemorrhagic exudate, but autolysis was too advanced to confirm or rule out graft-vs-host disease, and no satisfactory explanation was found for the abdominal complaints. In conclusion, the progressive respiratory failure was explained by severe diffuse alveolar damage of undetermined cause, and extensive bilateral bronchopneumonia caused by terminal Pseudomonas species infection.",

Metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of short nucleotide fragments with homology to APMV-1. To complete the genome of the clinical isolate, fragments obtained through whole transcriptome amplification were assembled against the APMV-1 genome with the highest similarity (Supplementary Methods). In brief, the assembly was performed using Sequencher software (version 4.1; Gene Codes). Because the whole-transcriptome amplification fragments did not overlap into a complete genome, the assembly was used to design primers for genome walking, PCR assays were performed with these primers, and products were sequenced. These efforts resulted in the genome completion of the Dutch clinical virus isolate.",

This corresponds with a lentogenic pathotype. In pigeons, all 5 intratracheally inoculated animals developed a productive infection, with shedding from the pharynx between 2 and 10 dpi, and from the cloaca between 7 and 17 dpi (Supplementary Figure 1) . Virus was transmitted to 1 of the 2 naive pigeons. None of the pigeons displayed clinical signs at any time point during the 3-week observation period. No gross lesions were observed in any pigeons at autopsy at 21 dpi. However, histopathological analysis showed that all 5 intratracheally inoculated pigeons plus the 1 infected naive pigeon had diffuse interstitial nonpurulent nephritis, which was absent in 2 negative control pigeons from the same flock (Supplementary Figure 2) . Also, 1 inoculated pigeon had multifocal nonpurulent pancreatitis. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that hPPMV-1/NL/579/2003 was present in the kidney sample of 3 inoculated pigeons with nephritis, and in the pancreas sample of 2 inoculated pigeons, including the 1 with pancreatitis (Supplementary Figure 3) . DISCUSSION We diagnosed PPMV-1 infection as the cause of diffuse alveolar damage in the Dutch female patient, based on colocalization of PPMV-1 antigen, high loads of PPMV-1 RNA, and characteristic histological lesions in autopsy specimens ( Figure 2 and Table 2 ). The PPMV-1-associated diffuse alveolar damage was exacerbated by bronchopneumonia due to Pseudomonas species infection, probably from intravenous catheterization. The combination of these 2 pulmonary diseases likely explains the severe respiratory failure leading to the death of this immunosuppressed patient.",

The immunosuppressive state of the Dutch and New York patients may have allowed spread of PPMV-1 beyond the respiratory tract. Pigeons and doves are the animal reservoir of PPMV-1 ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ). In Europe, these viruses are circulating predominantly in domestic pigeons (Columba livia domestica) or their wild relatives (rock pigeons, C. livia), and other members of the family Columbidae, especially Eurasian collared doves (Streptopelia decaocto) and European turtle doves (Streptopelia turtur) [15] . The tropism of hPPMV-1/ NL/579/2003 for the kidney and pancreas of experimentally infected pigeons ( Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 ) matches the tissue tropism of PPMV-1 in naturally infected pigeons [25] . The low pathogenicity of this isolate in chickens fits with the phenotype of other PPMV-1 strains [26] .",

It is relevant for these PPMV-1 cases that the risk of 2 pigeon-associated diseases-chlamydiosis and cryptococcosis-was largely a function of the immune status of patients, rather than contact with infected birds [32, 33] . Close contact between feral pigeons and humans commonly occurs in squares, public gardens, parks, markets, and railway stations in urban areas [33] . Therefore, people in urban areas are likely to have a higher rate of contact with feral pigeons than in rural areas. The proportion of the global human population living in urban areas is increasing. In 1950, 30% of the world's population lived in urban areas; this increased to 54% in 2014, and by 2050, 66% of the world's population is projected to be urban [34] . This suggests that the number of people at risk of contracting zoonotic infections, including PPMV-1, from feral pigeons will increase in coming decades. The combination of the above factors-large populations of feral pigeons with endemic PPMV-1 infection, increasing urbanization, and a higher proportion of immunocompromised individuals-may increase the risk of severe human cases of PPMV-1 infection.",
