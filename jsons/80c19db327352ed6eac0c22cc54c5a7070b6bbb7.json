Unfortunately, these tests often lack standardization and are not widely available.

Although a wide variety of etiological agents can cause CAP, a limited number of agents are responsible for the vast majority of cases (table 1) [1] . The role of microbiological testing for patients with CAP is still a matter of debate. Unfortunately, a specific etiological agent is determined in only approximately half of CAP cases, even when the best available diagnostic methods are used. The conventional laboratory tests for CAP-causing pathogens are so poor that current clinical practice guidelines do not recommend testing for any but the most severely affected individuals [1] . Nucleic acid-amplification methods have the potential to improve the timeliness, sensitivity, and accuracy of the tests used to detect respiratory pathogens. Advances in real-time amplification systems, multiplex analysis, and liquid-bead arrays have been key to the development of individual-pathogen and multipathogen panel approaches to diagnosis of CAP.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 324, "end": 327, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 764, "end": 767, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Streptococcus pneumoniae accounts for approximately two-thirds of cases of CAP for which an etiology is determined [2] . Early and accurate diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia is problematic because of the limitations of conventional methods. Sputum and blood cultures are slow and lack sensitivity, particularly for patients who have received previous antibiotic treatment. False-positive sputum culture results may occur as a result of oropharyngeal contamination, and Gram stains of sputum specimens are frequently unreliable. Pneumococcal urinary antigen tests offer the promise of increased sensitivity but are reported to have variable specificity depending on the comparators chosen, the way in which the test is performed and interpreted, and the population studied [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 118, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 774, "end": 777, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 778, "end": 781, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 782, "end": 785, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 786, "end": 789, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 790, "end": 793, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "A number of investigators have developed PCRbased assays for detection of S. pneumoniae in respiratory tract samples, with varying degrees of success [8] [9] [10] . There are 2 major concerns with PCR-based assays for this application: the presence of target genes in closely related viridans group streptococci and asymptomatic colonization with S. pneumoniae. A variety of pneumococcal gene targets, including lytA, ply, psaA, and the Spn9802 fragment, have been used in PCR assays [10, 11] . It is now clear that all but ply are found exclusively in S. pneumoniae. The use of realtime PCR methods addresses the second concern. In real-time PCR, the amount of target nucleic acid in the sample is inversely related to the cycle threshold (C T ) value. This relationship can be used to establish a C T value cutoff that provides optimal sensitivity and specificity by preventing false-positive results due to colonization with small numbers of pneumococci. Yang et al. [8] reported a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 80% for a quantitative real-time PCR assay for the ply gene-compared with a composite reference standard comprising Gram stains of sputum specimens and sputum and blood cultures-when a C T value of 29.86 was used as the cutoff. The presence of the ply gene in closely related viridans group streptococci may explain the relatively poor specificity of their assay. A panel of 6 real-time PCR assays targeting the lytA gene of S. pneumoniae, the mip gene of Legionella pneumophila, and the 16s rRNA genes of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophilia pneumoniae were used by Morozumi et al. [12] to analyze 429 clinical samples from children and adults with pneumonia. The analysis time was \u223c2 h, and analytical sensitivity ranged from 2 to 18 copies/reaction, depending on the pathogen. The sensitivity and specificity, relative to conventional cultures with clinical specimens, were as follows: 96.2% and 93.2% for S. pneumoniae; 95.8% and 95.4% for H. influenzae; 100% and 100% for S. pyogenes; and 100% and 95.4% for M. pneumoniae, respectively. Culture for C. pneumoniae was not performed, but positive PCR results were obtained for all 6 patients with se-rological evidence of infection. No patients had results positive for Legionella species by culture or PCR. In addition, they found an excellent correlation between semiquantitative culture results (1+ to 3+) and C T values in the PCR assays for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in clinical specimens. All patients with positive PCR and negative culture results for these 2 pathogens had a history of previous antibiotic therapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 150, "end": 153, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 154, "end": 157, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 158, "end": 162, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 484, "end": 488, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 489, "end": 492, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 970, "end": 973, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1665, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "There are commercial multiplex assays that use microwell hybridization for detection of Bordetella pertussis, L. pneumophila, Legionella micdadei, M. pneumoniae, and C. pneumoniae (Pneumoplex; Prodesse [13] ) or L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae, and C. pneumoniae (Chamylege; Argene [14] ).

This approach eliminates concerns about decreased organism viability associated with transport of specimens and the effects of previous antibiotic therapy. Real-time PCR panels that include the common causative pathogens of CAP could substantially increase the diagnostic yield in clinical practice. Unfortunately, these assays are not standardized or widely available, and, except for L. pneumophila and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (table 2) , no FDA-cleared nucleic acid-amplification assays for bacterial respiratory pathogens are available. One major limitation to the molecular diagnostic approach to detection of bacterial causes of pneumonia is that culture would still be required to obtain an isolate for antimicrobial-susceptibility testing.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, the H5N1 strain of influenza virus, and, most recently, adenovirus serotype 14 [15] have focused attention on viruses as causes of severe lower respiratory tract infections. Historically, clinical virology laboratories have used cell culture and immunoassays to detect the 7 \"usual suspects\": influenza viruses A and B; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus; and adenovirus. More recently, nucleic acidamplification methods have been used to detect respiratory viruses, often with dramatic increases in sensitivity. However, the diversity and complexity of the viral flora present significant challenges for nucleic acid-based detection systems. The dis- covery of 6 new respiratory viruses since 2000-including metapneumovirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, influenza virus strain H5N1, coronavirus strains NL63 and Hku1, and human bocavirus-has presented new challenges for comprehensive viral diagnostics. Multiplex PCR and microarray-based systems provide potential solutions to this complex diagnostic problem. However, the number of viruses detectable in a single multiplex PCR is relatively small, and, although microarrays can detect many more pathogens, this approach is impractical for routine diagnostic use.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 266, "end": 270, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Recently, 3 different, highly multiplexed PCR assays for respiratory viruses that use microsphere flow cytometry (Luminex Xmap technology) to decode the PCR products have been commercially developed (by EraGen Biosciences [16] , Genaco/ Qiagen [17] , and Luminex/Tm Bioscience [18] ), and one assay (Luminex/Tm Bioscience) has recently been cleared by the FDA for diagnostic use. These assays can detect up to 20 different respiratory viruses in a single PCR, with an analysis time of \u223c4 h.

The real value in these systems is that they can expand the capabilities of diagnostic laboratories to detection of viruses not commonly sought, such as rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and metapneumovirus, with little more effort than is currently expended to detect the \"usual suspects.\" Expanded panels can also detect more mixed viral infections and more mixed infections with bacteria and viruses.

Respiratory tract samples from the control group were also tested using standard microbiological methods. The authors found that realtime PCR methods significantly increased the diagnostic yield, compared with standard diagnostic tests alone, but did not reduce antibiotic use, duration of hospital stay, or treatment costs.
