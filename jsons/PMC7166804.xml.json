Among pathogens of ARTI, HPIVs are secondary only to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [Weinberg, 2006]. Four types of HPIVs have been identified. Studies of HPIVs have focused primarily on HPIV1, 2, and 3; HPIV\u20104 has not attracted sufficient clinical attention due to the fact that the illness caused by it is minor [Aguilar et al., 2000; Templeton et al., 2005; Vachon et al., 2006]. Recent studies indicate that HPIV\u20104 is associated with respiratory infections including bronchitis and pneumonia [Rubin et al., 1993; Lindquist et al., 1997; Lau et al., 2005, 2009; Vachon et al., 2006;]. Furthermore, it was found that this virus had an outbreak in a small range and that children under 2 years of age may encounter serious acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) [Lau et al., 2005; Weinberg, 2006; Wang et al., 2012]. However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HPIV4 in Chinese pediatric patients with ALRTIs have not been addressed fully. Therefore, this study collected 771 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples (NPAs) from children with ALRTIs for summarization and analysis of HPIVs (especially HPIV\u20104) in children with ALRTIs in this region, including prevalence, clinical characteristics, and differences from other HPIV types, in order to lay a foundation for further research.",

Twenty\u2010eight (3.63%) patients were positive for HPIV\u20104, 12 (1.55%) for HPIV\u20101, 4 (0.51%) for HPIV\u20102, and 107 (13.87%) were positive for HPIV\u20103 (Table I). All of the children found to have HPIVs were 5 years of age or younger. The detection rate of HPIVs varied significantly between age groups (\u03c72 = 25.046, P = 0.000). No child 6 months of age or less was found to have HPIV\u20101, and only four patients 6\u201312 months of age were found to have HPIV\u20102. The detection rate of HPIV\u20103 was highest in children less than 1 year of age. Compared to HPIV types 1\u20133, HPIV\u20104 was detected at a higher rate in patients 36 months of age. Further statistical analysis suggested that only for HPIV\u20103 was the difference in the detection rate between ages statistically significant (\u03c72 = 29.648, P = 0.000) (Table I). The seasonal distribution of HPIVs fluctuated, and a phylogenetic tree is shown in Figure 1. Overall, HPIVs peaked during the summer, which is also when the highest detection rates of HPIV\u20101 and HPIV\u20104 were found. The detection rate of HPIVs varied significantly depending on the seasonal distribution (\u03c72 = 22.236, P = 0.000).",

However, serological epidemiological survey data showed that cases of positive HPIV\u20104 accounted for approximately 3% of all patients with respiratory tract infections and from 50 to 90% in children and adolescents [Hasman et al., 2009]. Studies showed that in adult patients with flu\u2010like or acute respiratory tract disease in the United States, the HPIV4 detection rate was 5.8% [El Feghaly et al., 2010]. Hong Kong Lau et al. [2009] reported that among 2,912 NPAs, with other respiratory viruses being negative, HPIV\u20104 positives were detected at a rate of 1.2%.

In the past, HPIV4 was known to cause mild disease and therefore did not attract sufficient attention. However, in recent years, HPIV4 was found to have caused a localized outbreak of pneumonia, bronchiolitis and aseptic meningitis [Vachon et al., 2006; El Feghaly et al., 2010]. This study showed that all patients found with HPIVs had the most common symptoms of HPIV infection, for example, cough, fever, and wheezing. Some patients presented with vomiting and diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms; while others with HPIV\u20103 and HPIV\u20104 exhibited polypnea and cyanosis. In most children, rales were heard in lung examination. In terms of clinical diagnosis, bronchial pneumonia was the most common finding.

HRV was the most common additional respiratory virus detected. This study also compared the clinical manifestations between HPIV\u20103 and HPIV\u20104 mono\u2010infection and co\u2010infection groups. There was no difference between the two groups in gender, seasonality, mixed infection, fever, wheezing, polypnea, cyanosis or diarrhea. Due to the low number of HPIV\u20101 and HPIV\u20102 cases, we did not compare their clinical manifestations in the study.",
