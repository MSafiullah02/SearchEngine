Others have been partnering with local, national, and global organizations or volunteering their services on the front lines. Individuals are making and donating personal protective equipment (PPE) and helping protect those on the front lines. Operation Walk chapters across the country have donated more than 13,000 masks, 15,000 pairs of gloves, hundreds of gowns, disinfectant wipes, and head and shoe covers to hospitals here and abroad fighting COVID-19. Many of these donations come directly from supplies that had been donated or bought for future trips. More than one chapter had already shipped their equipment in preparation from an upcoming trip. These chapters have informed their partner countries that they can use the supplies for their own battle with COVID-19.",

It has been heartwarming to see orthopaedic surgeons and residents stepping out of their comfort zone to care for patients in any way necessary. However, a rise in the daily COVID burden does not obviate the need for orthopaedic services, and it is equally important to shield a portion of our surgeons so they can maintain essential orthopaedic functions. . As it applies to arthroplasty, we needed to be available to treat patients with peri-prosthetic fractures, acute peri-prosthetic infections, and revision patients with severe osteolysis that are at risk of fracture without prompt treatment. Forging successful partnerships with the ED has been critical. Patients that have screened out for COVID-19 should be evaluated primarily in the orthopaedic clinic so that beds could be available for COVID-19 patients; this collaboration has been very helpful for our ER colleagues.",

While the world is eager to move on, until we are certain of control, we will continue to have outbreaks. Here we will need to be vigilant as we resume elective cases. We will also have to be aware of the at-risk populations domestically and internationally. From a humanitarian perspective those with fewer resources and access are hit hardest. Not only is this a historical worldwide perspective, but it is evident in today's crisis here in the U.S., where a disproportionate number of infections and deaths are occurring in Black Americans [8, 9]. Immigrants and refugees within our own country have been known to be a vulnerable population; the native American population had a 4 to 5 times mortality rate from H1N1 [8, 10]. The impact will be greater in developing countries. The drain on resources of already poor health care systems with weak infrastructures will be unsustainable. Hardest hit will be countries already in humanitarian crises with corrupt governments and those with refugees [11, 12]. With the diversion of healthcare resources to the immediate need, the underlying disparities are widened. Refugees in many countries already are a humanitarian crisis. Given their close living spaces, poverty and xenophobia their conditions will worsen. [12, 13]. Areas of armed conflict are particularly susceptible to lack of resources and care. During the Ebola epidemic in West Africa there were 11,300 deaths related directly to the outbreak and more than 10,600 attributed to reduced access for treatment of malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis [13].",

In a survey of AAHKS members, Iorio et al found a 30.4% decrease in surgical volume and a 29.3% in outpatient visits [16, 17]. Lack of insurance, paid time off and financial constraints will greatly impact access and volumes. It will be necessary for us moving forward to consider how to care for the underinsured, to increase value in healthcare delivery, and to help those who will need to delay care. This can be accomplished with more efficient visits and evidenced based practices [18]. The use of telemedicine offers an opportunity to deliver care at the least overall cost for some visits.",

Rapid spread of this virus is attributable to the interconnected nature of today\u2019s world.

Developed countries will need to support less developed ones and share best practices and knowledge [9]. While we see telemedicine and newer technologies as a means to care for our patients while social distancing, it can revolutionize the care for those without any access in underserved parts of the world both with direct care and education.
