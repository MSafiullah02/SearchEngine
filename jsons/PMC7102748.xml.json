The 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09 virus) was estimated to cause 201 000 respiratory deaths in the first 12 months, with most deaths occurring in patients aged <65 years [2, 3\u2022]. The avian influenza viruses A(H5N1), A(H7N9), A(H10N8), A(H5N6), together with the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses, are the most virulent respiratory viruses affecting humans [4\u2022, 5, 6, 7]. Most patients with influenza virus infection develop mild upper respiratory tract infection. Life-threatening complications include severe viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary embolism, myocarditis, encephalopathy, Reye's syndrome, hemophagocytic syndrome, multiorgan dysfunction and exacerbation of underlying chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases [3\u2022, 4\u2022]. Currently available antivirals and vaccines have limited efficacy in the treatment and prevention of influenza virus infection [8]. Understanding the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection in human is important in designing novel strategies to improve the management of influenza.",

Virologists have extensively studied the role of viral components in the viral life cycle and in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection in humans [12]. Specific amino acid changes in the viral proteins have been associated with increased disease severity in humans or adaptation of avian influenza viruses in humans [13].

Surfactant protein B (SFTPB) is a hydrophobic protein responsible for the structural integrity of the pulmonary alveoli [19]. In a cohort of 84 Chinese patients with severe and mild A(H1N1)pdm09 infection who were matched for age, sex and underlying conditions, the SNP rs1130866-C was significantly associated with severe disease. The association between rs1130866-C and severe disease was verified in a second cohort patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, in which multivariate analysis was performed to adjust for potential confounding factors [20\u2022\u2022]. The SNP rs1130866-C has been associated with glycosylation at the amino acid residue 129 of SFTPB, which reduces secretion of SFTPB [21]. It remains to be determined whether SFTPB has direct antiviral activity against influenza virus. Surfactant protein C (SFTPC) is a lipoprotein with antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus [22], but its antiviral activity against influenza virus or its genetic variants associated with severe influenza has not yet been reported.",

            "text": "Upon influenza virus infection, type I interferons are produced by host cells to limit viral replication. The function of type I interferons is mediated via the expression of many interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Several ISGs are especially important in the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection. Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM), including IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3, were identified to have direct antiviral activity against influenza virus in a genomewide siRNA screen [25]. A human long noncoding RNA, which reduces IFITM3 gene expression, enhanced influenza virus replication in a transgenic mouse model [26\u2022]. IFITM3, which is located in endosome, inhibits viral replication by blocking the fusion of the viral and the host membrane [27, 28]. Interestingly, amphotericin B, an antifungal, was found to increase viral replication by interfering with the blockage of membrane fusion by IFITM3 [29]. The C/C genotype of rs12252 is associated with a 21-amino-acid truncation at the N-terminal of the IFITM3 protein, which alters the localization of the IFITM3 from endosomal compartment to the cell periphery [30]. Several studies have looked into IFITM3 SNP rs12252 in the susceptibility to severe influenza in humans. The genotype rs12252-C was over-represented in Caucasian and Chinese patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection [31\u2022\u2022, 32]. In patients with A(H7N9) infection, those carrying rs12252-C/C genotype had higher mortality [33]. However, the importance of rs12252-C allele in severe influenza has been challenged. Firstly, in a study using pseudotyped influenza A viruses, transfection of A549 cells with plasmids expressing the truncated form of IFITM3 could reduce viral replication similarly to those with plasmids carrying the full length IFITM3 [34]. Secondly, in a study comparing 34 patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection and >5000 controls, no significant difference in the rs12252 genotype frequency was found [35].",

Three independent studies assessed the role of TMPRSS2 in influenza-infected mice. TMPRSS2 knockout mice were resistant to influenza A(H7N9) and A(H1N1) virus infection, but there were discrepant results regarding susceptibility to A(H3N2) virus infection [43, 44, 45]. By integration of a pilot genomewide association study and the lung expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) dataset, a TMPRSS2 intronic SNP rs2070788 was prioritized for further studies [46]. The genetic predisposition of rs2070788 to severe A(H1N1)pdm09 was validated in 409 A(H1N1)pdm09 patients including 162 severe cases and 247 mild controls. In the functional study, a regulatory SNP rs383510 in high linkage disequilibrium with rs2070788 was uncovered as the causal variant underlying the genetic association. Genetic predispositions of rs2070788 and rs383510 to severe influenza were also validated in an A(H7N9) patient cohort.",

With high-throughput assays, a large number of genes or genetic variants were found to be associated with viral replication or disease severity in animals or in humans. The current challenge is how we can select specific host genes that are important for the treatment or prevention of influenza virus infection. Discrepancies in the results from similar studies also raise the suspicion whether certain genes are indeed important. For example, out of 925 host factors which affect influenza virus replication that were identified during in vitro genomewide siRNA knockdown screening, only 69 genes were present in at least two of these screens [66]. In human genetic association studies, many genetic variants identified to be associated with disease severity in one study could not be reproduced in other studies (Table 1).",

In human genetic association studies, it is important to limit confounding factors as much as possible. For example, the cases and controls should be matched for age, sex, ethnic group and comorbidities, and multivariate analysis can be utilized to assess whether the genetic variant is an independent risk factor. The identified genetic variants should be validated in other independent cohorts. The functional significance of these genetic variants can be refined by eQTL analysis [67]. Pathway analysis helps to identify pathways that may not be apparent when analyzing individual genes. Interactome screens, which identify host genes that interact with viral proteins, may increase the likelihood of identifying genes that are potential host targets for treatment [68]. The establishment of genetically diverse mice population has allowed the identification of susceptibility genes by correlating genetic variations to disease phenotypes [69\u2022]. In addition to genetic data, host response to influenza has also been assessed using transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and lipidomic analysis of cell cultures, animals or humans [70\u2022, 71]. These data reflect biological regulation of host factors at different levels. An integration of these \u2018omics\u2019 data will improve the accuracy of identifying the susceptibility genes [72\u2022\u2022].",

Antivirals and anti-inflammatory agents targeting host factors and vaccine strategies improving host response have shown promise in animal models. For example, sphingosine-1-phosphate agonist, protectin D1 and anti-leptin antibody have been shown to protect mice against lethal influenza virus infection [70\u2022, 75, 76]. Imiquimod, a TLR7 agonist, has been shown to expedite and augment antibody response after influenza virus vaccine in both animal and human studies [77, 78].
