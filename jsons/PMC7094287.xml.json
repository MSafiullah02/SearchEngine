Heterogeneous non-competitive sandwich ELISA is performed in 96-well microtiter plates with anti-analyte-specific antibodies attached to the surface. Solid phase-bound antibodies are subsequently exposed to the analyte-containing sample and, after separation of free and bound reactants, the analyte-captured fraction is quantitated with a second antigen-specific antibody conjugated to a reporter enzyme. After a usually lengthy incubation period, product formation is measured by a single readout, from which the sample titer is derived. The main drawback of this method is that a single measurement of product formation does not ensure that it was obtained within the linear range of the progress curve, which is the condition that guarantees proportionality between enzyme reaction rate and analyte bound fraction, and ensures that enzyme substrate has not been depleted.",

In these assays, the reaction product is determined by a single readout taken after extended incubation, which raises doubts as to the quantitative accuracy of such assays. It has since become customary to follow signal development until sufficient color is observed, usually after a recommended 10-min incubation (Crowther, 2009). This potentially inexact practice has not changed with the now-generalized use of mouse IgG ELISA kits; our survey of the suggested procedure for six commonly used commercial mouse IgG kits showed that a single measurement after 10 to 30 min enzyme development is the usual protocol. Most of these kits also leave construction of the calibration curve to the user; if not managed carefully, this can introduce additional uncertainty as to accuracy.",
