Short, PCV2-like, rearranged genomes (483-896 bases) have also been reported in Chinese pigs Wen, He, Ni, et al., 2012; Zhai et al., 2014) . The generation of such truncated and rearranged genomes may be related to that seen when viruses are passaged at high multiplicity of infection leading to defective interfering viral particles retaining only essential Cis elements required for genome replication and requiring transcomplementation from a helper virus (Mankertz et al., 1997) . A related phenomenon may be the generation of truncated ssDNA circular geminivirus and anellovirus genome when passaged in vitro (De Villiers et al., 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 172, "end": 191, "text": "(Zhai et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 347, "end": 369, "text": "(Burbelo et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 370, "end": 392, "text": "Victoria et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 614, "end": 640, "text": "Wen, He, Ni, et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 641, "end": 659, "text": "Zhai et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 980, "end": 1003, "text": "(Mankertz et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1161, "text": "(De Villiers et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Chicken meat showed the presence of numerous gyroviruses including the highly prevalent CAV reported world-wide (Schat, 2009; Toro et al., 2006) .
