Immediately at birth the newborn employs intricate breathing patterns that establish and maintain airway volume and attain ventilation. Thereafter, throughout life the normal breathing pattern, eupnoea, can be gentle tidal breathing that is involuntary and hardly sensed, but many other breathing patterns are employed in normal conditions. Thus, an expanded view of normal breathing is that it consists of centrally controlled coordinated muscular activities which aim to ensure that the airway is protected and has optimal supra- and sub-glottic volumes to maintain homoeostasis and provide a stable platform to enable ventilation with ensuing efficient gas exchange and transport (Hutchison 2007). Normal breathing involves central coordination with other motor acts, e.g. swallowing, speech and walking.",

Two features of central control deserve emphasis. There is a redundancy to the circuitry, with alternative drives and pathways, and there is a motor control hierarchy: rapid airway protection takes precedence over control of absolute airway volume, which in turn takes precedence over relative tidal volume changes. Control of breathing is exercised by the coordinated activities of the nasal, pharyngeal, laryngeal and pump muscles which, in concert with lower airway smooth muscle tone that adjusts airway wall stiffness, alter the transairway pressure gradients. The result is that tidal ventilation occurs simultaneously with the control of total airway volume, which adjusts airway pressure critical for patency, central feedback and likely drive threshold (Adrian 1933). Airway and chest wall neural feedback is rapid (milliseconds) and crucial for homoeostasis, enabling the controller to adjust flow within a breath and match motor outputs with the structural characteristics of the different parts of the respiratory system and their associated mechanics.

            "text": "Apnoea of prematurity is associated with physiological characteristics and pathological conditions found in the preterm infant born at <37 completed postmenstrual weeks. Its incidence is inversely related to gestational age (Henderson-Smart 1981). Brief cessations of airflow lasting a few seconds are common in sleep and may represent a transient return to fetal life. Apnoea demanding attention and meriting the clinical diagnosis of apnoea of prematurity is that lasting 15\u201320 s or that accompanied by bradycardia, cyanosis or pallor. Apnoea is categorised into different types. Central apnoea (incidence ~10\u201325 %) is a lack of tidal airflow accompanied by a lack of pump muscle activity (with or without an open glottis). Obstructive apnoea (~10\u201320 %) is an absence of tidal airflow accompanied by upper airway obstruction, which can commence in expiration and continue despite pump muscle activity and in the subsequent neural expiration. Mixed apnoea (~50\u201375 %) is both central and obstructive apnoeas occurring serially, usually in that order. Bradycardia (heart rate <100/min) usually follows the onset of apnoea of prematurity. Oxygen saturation values fall (<85 %) and can produce cyanosis. An associated pallor can indicate the occurrence of a dive reflex response with preferential blood flow to the heart, brain and adrenals but diminished blood flow to other important organs, e.g. the gut. The newborn brain is more tolerant than the adult to hypoxia, but if apnoea is ongoing, death results.",

            "text": "Rostral and caudal CNS structures influence the control of breathing patterns (Feldman and Del Negro 2006; Rybak et al. 2008). Lesioning studies in animals have identified that, at a minimum, eupnoea requires a pontomedullary neuronal network (Rybak et al. 2008). When both upper pontine respiratory neuronal groups (PRG) and vagal afferents are removed, the lower pontine-medullary output is apneusis, a pattern typified by prolonged inspiratory drive. The generation of signals for coordination of laryngeal and diaphragmatic activities appears to be dependent upon an intact lower pons (Hutchison and Speck 2003). Inspiratory and pre-inspiratory neurons involved in rhythm generation have been identified in the ventral medullary pre-B\u00f6tzinger and parafacial regions, respectively. Neurons in the B\u00f6tzinger complex exert mainly expiratory control (Feldman and Del Negro 2006). Specific types of premotor medullary neurons have been classified by their signal shapes and timings. Their actions result in a central breathing cycle consisting of three phases: inspiration, post-inspiration and expiration (Feldman and Del Negro 2006). Mechanical changes following these outputs are seen well in grunting (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_4). Protective, mechanical and speech-related changes occur quickly within a breath; thus, phase-switching and pattern-switching neurons are important (Rybak et al. 2008) (Fig. 47.6).",

Gene abnormalities are reported in the central hypoventilation syndrome (Abu-Shaweesh and Martin 2008). Neurotransmitters (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), adenosine, prostaglandin E, serotonin, endorphins, catecholamines, glutamate) affect respiratory-related neuronal function (Darnall et al. 2006). The neurochemistry in preterm infants favours neuronal inhibition over excitation. In animals, prostaglandin E production can be triggered by the cytokine IL-1\u03b2, while adenosine stimulates GABA production (Abu-Shaweesh and Martin 2008). Metabolism is increased by hyperthermia and decreased by hypothermia. Both hypothermia and hyperthermia can decrease breathing, suggesting that hypothermia decreases excitation more than inhibition and that hyperthermia augments the dominant intrinsic inhibitory pathways and their inputs. Thus, the importance of temperature homoeostasis is emphasised.",

            "text": "Central apnoea may result from altered PRG input (Hutchison and Speck 2003). When the PRG is removed from decerebrate cats, the response to an expiratory airway load is a pattern similar to central apnoea with an open glottis. In this circumstance, expiratory flow will occur passively until the relaxation volume (Vr) is reached (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_4, Fig. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_4_Fig6). Preterm infants actively maintain sub-glottic volume above their low Vr when awake, but during central sleep apnoeas the sub-glottic volume can decrease. This is especially seen in REM sleep when all types of apnoeas are more common and longer and can be associated with profound bradycardia. Central apnoea with glottic closure can also occur, e.g. in some human newborns who are depressed at birth, in preterm lambs (Praud and Reix 2005) and in gasping animals with exposure to acute cerebral hypoxia/ischaemia (Hutchison et al. 2002). Gasping is typified by short diaphragmatic bursts and long expirations with glottic closure. Initially, this incremental breathing pattern (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_4) maintains sub-glottic volume, which is probably critical in autoresuscitation (Hutchison et al. 2002). In lambs, when central depression results in prolonged expiratory apnoea, glottic adductor activity persists until all muscle activity ceases (Praud and Reix 2005). During mixed apnoea, obstructive upper airway closure commences before diaphragmatic activity and its associated fall in airway pressure (Idiong et al. 1998) and thus appears to be due to centrally altered laryngeal or pharyngeal muscle activities (Idiong et al. 1998; Upton et al. 1992). Obstructive apnoea is due to insufficient pharyngeal opening pressure, which reflects an imbalance between factors that decrease pharyngeal patency (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_4) and the central motor output that dictates a compensatory increase in muscle tone. In the preterm infant, pharyngeal collapse can occur passively with neck flexion or actively in sleep, when pharyngeal wall muscle tone can be low (Thach and Stark 1979). Expiratory laryngeal closure, triggered by a low lung volume, could play a role by reducing intrapharyngeal pressure below its critical value for patency.",

            "text": "Throughout life, hypocarbia decreases the central drive to breathe (Khan et al. 2005), and during the associated hypopnoea/apnoea, laryngeal adductor activity (glottic closure) is found (Jounieaux et al. 1995; Kuna et al. 1993). The apnoeic threshold is higher in preterm infants with apnoea (Gerhardt and Bancalari 1984), making apnoea more likely with a fall in PCO2, e.g. with normal activity, sighing. Hypercapnia increases ventilation, but the response is depressed by accompanying hypoxia (Rigatto 1986) and can be accompanied by expiratory laryngeal closure (Eichenwald et al. 1993). At high PCO2 levels apnoea can occur (Alvaro et al. 1992). Marked hypercapnia may act via central inhibition of respiratory muscle output and/or by inducing chest wall distortion that can trigger apnoea with laryngeal closure. The preterm infant\u2019s response to hypoxaemia may or may not start with a transient increase in ventilation, which, if present, is dependent upon carotid body integrity. A decrease in central output to the diaphragm follows; this decrease is attenuated in non-rapid eye movement sleep (Rigatto 1986). Hypoxia can result in periodic breathing and then apnoea (Rigatto 1986). The responsiveness of the carotid body is depressed after birth but recovers within 2 weeks (Abu-Shaweesh and Martin 2008). Repeated exposure to hypoxaemia postnatally may augment the carotid body sensitivity to hypoxaemia with a resultant hyperventilation, followed by hypocarbia and decreased ventilation (Al-Matary et al. 2004; Nock et al. 2004). These cycles may produce periodic breathing and apnoea. However, prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke may diminish the response to hypoxaemia (Gauda et al. 2004; Schneider et al. 2008), and exposure to hyperoxia at critical periods of development can inhibit carotid body development in animals (Gauda et al. 2004). Diminished stimulatory responses to hypoxaemia have been found in preterm infants (Gauda et al. 2004). Thus, central integration of both increased and decreased carotid body inputs may promote apnoea (Gauda et al. 2004).",

Chest wall distortion, inward movement that threatens airway volume, occurs easily and stimulates chest wall afferents that inhibit phrenic activity (intercostal-phrenic reflex) and/or produce glottic closure. Newborn infant motor responses to vagal afferents are easily elicited (Thach 2001). Lower airway slowly adapting receptors (SARs) detect within-breath volume/stretch, while rapidly adapting irritant receptors (RARs) detect distortion/deflation. C-fibre receptors, associated with the pulmonary vasculature, detect chemical changes. In animals, the SAR inputs stimulate the chest wall and diaphragmatic pump muscles during inspiration until peak afferent activity is reached when inspiration is inhibited. Increased vagal afferent feedback accompanies a large inflation and triggers expiratory apnoea \u2013 the Hering-Breuer inflation reflex, a response modulated by airway CO2 in animals. After a large inflation, abdominal expiratory muscle activity is triggered \u2013 the Hering-Breuer expiration reflex. Prevention of inspiration by airway occlusion causes a fall in upper and lower airway vagal input, prolonging inspiration. During partial vagal blockade, inflation produces a second inspiratory effort \u2013 Head\u2019s paradoxical reflex. Prevention of expiration by airway occlusion maintains vagal afferent input, thus prolonging expiratory time. In adult animals, when airway volume is considerably reduced, irritant receptor stimulation triggers an inspiration \u2013 the Hering-Breuer deflation reflex. However, irritant receptor input in preterm infants, with deflation or with tracheal stimulation, can result in apnoea (Fleming et al. 1978; Hannam et al. 1998). A cough response is only noted after 34 weeks postmenstrual age (Fleming et al. 1978).",

            "text": "The Hering-Breuer and Head reflexes may act to optimise lung inflation without tissue damage during inspiration and tailor expiratory time for a given expired volume. The stretch receptors may also act to increase central neuronal activity during expiration such that inspiration begins at a higher level of expiratory vagal input and thus peaks sooner, signalling an earlier cessation of tidal inspiration and promoting respiratory rate (Al-Matary et al. 2004). There is support for Head\u2019s viewpoint. Infants use laryngeal and diaphragmatic means of maintaining higher absolute airway volumes and breathe faster (Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_4) (Thach 2001). In the preterm neonate, atelectasis/deflation post-extubation is associated with apnoea (Hannam et al. 1998). A lower end-expiratory volume (EEV) is noted in REM sleep and in apnoeic infants (Poets 2003). Furthermore, in lambs breathing through a tracheostomy, absence of laryngeal control of EEV is associated with apnoea (Johnson 1979). Airway pressure support after birth is the mainstay for reversal of apnoea and bradycardia, the latter being used in initial stabilisation as a sign to indicate the need for airway volume support. After birth, the intensivist employs the \u2018open lung (airway) approach\u2019 during artificial ventilation. Failure to maintain sub-glottic airway volume when the preterm infant is on a ventilator results in desaturation/bradycardia (Bolivar et al. 1995).

This response to SLN input decreases with advancing age but can be rekindled by a concurrent central depression or an upper airway infection (Daly 1997). The coexistence of central inhibition (e.g. with sedation or hypo-/hyperthermia), followed by SLN stimulation (e.g. at intubation) and then hypoxia, can produce an exaggerated and potentially lethal response, even in the adult (Daly 1997) (Sect. 10.1007/978-3-642-01219-8_4).

            "text": "Apnoea can present on the first day of life and is virtually universal in preterm infants born at <28 weeks gestational age (Fig. 47.8) (Henderson-Smart 1981). The severity of apnoea is defined by its duration, the degrees of associated oxygen desaturation and bradycardia, and the type of therapeutic intervention provided, from minimal stimulation to total respiratory support. The assessment of the apnoeic patient consists of the nose-to-diaphragm then the head-to-toe approach. Apnoea of prematurity is differentiated from periodic breathing, a repetitive series of pauses in breathing separated by a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of breaths. Periodic breathing in normal preterm infants is considered benign, but it can be associated with hypocarbia, hypoxia and CNS hypoxia/ischaemia and with a fall in sub-glottic airway volume (Khan et al. 2005; Rigatto 1986). Conditions resulting in apnoea, including structural lesions (Brazy et al. 1987), are considered before a diagnosis of idiopathic apnoea is made (Fig. 47.9). Upper airway contact with food or with gastric contents can result in apnoea, but episodes of gastroesophageal reflux do not appear to be temporally linked to apnoea. In animals, prior upper airway exposure to acid can alter the response to subsequent mechanical loads (Sant\u2019Ambrogio et al. 1998). Thus, the clinical impression that the two are related may be indirect. Pre-existing anaemia exacerbates the apnoeic response to SLN stimulation in animals and is important in postoperative apnoea (Cote et al. 1995). However, blood transfusion therapy for apnoea of prematurity is debated.\n\n\n",

Careful attention is paid to nasal patency (secretions, proper prong size and attachment of nasal continuous airway positive pressure [NCPAP] device), environmental temperature, correct neck posture (neck flexion) and abdominal distention (air in the stomach, correct positioning of gastric tube, a tight diaper forcing abdominal contents into the chest).

Laboratory and clinical studies strongly support the use of a modern NCPAP device (Hutchison and Bignall 2008; Pantalitschka et al. 2009). Weaning from NCPAP is little studied. In general, when an infant is receiving <30 % supplementary oxygen, a switch to high-flow nasal cannulae can be made. The advantage of nasal cannulae lies in their ease of use. The disadvantages are that the airway pressure they generate is not monitored and there may be increased infectious risks. Severe apnoea can warrant invasive mechanical ventilation but involves the complications of \u2018endotrauma\u2019 (Hutchison and Bignall 2008). There is interest in non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for apnoea, and larger trials are awaited (Hutchison and Bignall 2008; Pantalitschka et al. 2009). Since coordination between the upper airway and pump muscles is critical, NIPPV is applied synchronously with the central outputs to the breathing muscles (Jounieaux et al. 1995); this may be difficult during sleep.",

Thus, monitoring of serum caffeine concentrations is unnecessary if the recommended dosing is used. Tachycardia with caffeine can result from a pharmacodynamic effect. It resolves with cessation of therapy despite a normal serum concentration. Slightly higher and significantly higher caffeine dosing regimens have been used. The latter regimen increased successful weaning from a ventilator (Steer et al. 2003). Concerns about the extensive use of caffeine relate to its action as an antagonism of adenosine, a body-wide mediator of vasodilatation, which is involved in neurodevelopment. However, a controlled trial of early postnatal administration (<10 days) of caffeine versus placebo found that those receiving caffeine in recommended doses had less bronchopulmonary dysplasia (by 10 %) and improved cognitive outcome (by 5 %) (Schmidt et al. 2007; Schmidt et al. 2006b). Adenosine blockade may still be problematic. Caffeine therapy has been linked to necrotising enterocolitis, albeit weakly. Preterm infants are susceptible to white matter injury and thus at increased risk when cerebral blood flow is low (Darnall et al. 2006). If an infant on caffeine therapy develops hypocarbia during ventilatory support, any hypocarbia-associated decrease in cerebral perfusion may be aggravated.",

This is successful ~80 % of the time (Spitzer 2002) ensuring a sufficient period for caffeine elimination prior to a hospital discharge decision.

By contrast, for those born at <28 weeks, apnoea can persist up to 44 weeks postmenstrual age (Darnall et al. 1997; Eichenwald et al. 1997). Home monitoring is indicated under certain circumstances (Table 47.4). There is no evidence for an association between apnoea of prematurity and SIDS, nor has monitoring for apnoea of prematurity been shown to affect the incidence of SIDS (Darnall et al. 2006). If caffeine therapy has been discontinued and the infant has been free of apnoea and bradycardia for 5\u20137 days, then discharge is not delayed and home monitoring is not prescribed. Infants should adopt a \u2018back to sleep\u2019 posture prior to discharge and be tested in a car seat. Families should receive regular SIDS counselling advice, including the avoidance of sleeping in situations where the infant can be compressed or have their upper airway blocked.\n",

It is often accompanied by bradycardia and oxygen desaturation. Thus, severe apnoea is life-threatening.Apnoea results from changes in the central outputs to the muscles of breathing and changes induced by altered intrinsic/extrinsic, central/peripheral and neural/chemical inputs.Apnoea is exaggerated when upper airway afferents are stimulated during central depression. This can be evident during intubation of the sedated patient.Conditions associated with clinical apnoea are excluded before a diagnosis of idiopathic apnoea of prematurity is made.Apnoea can recur postoperatively in former preterm infants up to ~60 postmenstrual weeks, and this is exaggerated with anaemia. Perioperative caffeine therapy may prevent this apnoea.Management includes avoiding factors that trigger apnoea and non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies, the latter usually with caffeine which, using recommended dosing, has short-term and long-term respiratory and neurodevelopmental benefits.Knowledge of the natural history of apnoea of prematurity and caffeine pharmacokinetics allows for the planning of safe home discharge and home monitoring, if required.Follow-up for interim medical care and neurodevelopmental evaluation is advised.\n",

This occurs transiently in airway volume maintenance, airway protection and speech and is determined by central drive/status and afferent inputs. Expiratory laryngeal closure increases as central drive decreases. It is postulated that in mixed apnoea a switch from central apnoea to obstructive apnoea accompanies a progressive decrease in central drive and that this may be enhanced by a decrease in airway volume during central apnoea with an open glottis",

The motor response determining expiratory glottic closure is seen as being determined primarily by the central drive/status, amplified secondly by decreased or error signals in neural afferent inputs and amplified thirdly by input from carotid body stimulation. Thus, increased carotid body stimulation can amplify an existing pattern. By contrast, a sudden decrease in carotid body input can trigger a switch to a protective pattern.
