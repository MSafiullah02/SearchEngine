            "text": "Antisense oligonucleotides are used widely to interfere with biological processes in cells and are being developed in some cases as drugs.1,2 There are numerous types of oligonucleotide analogue of varying chemistries, as well as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and they encompass a range of intracellular targets and modes of action. Common to all oligonucleotide types is the need to be delivered into cells and tissues efficiently in order to carry out their targeting functions. Some types are able to enter certain cell classes in vivo (such as hepatocytes or kidney cells) reasonably efficiently in naked form (e.g., those containing both phosphorothioate (PS) linkages and certain sugar modifications),3 but bio-availability at the right cellular location may still be limited by poor cell trafficking and endosomal entrapment. In other cell types, cell targeting and entry is found to be poor for many naked oligonucleotide types, or their ability to reach the desired tissue is limited. Accordingly, there have been massive efforts to search for new delivery systems that may enhance tissue penetration, improve cell targeting and cell entry, as well as enhance intracellular bioavailability at the desired biological target. The most prevalent delivery systems for oligonucleotides and siRNA are cationic liposomes and other nanoparticle delivery systems, based initially on cell culture studies and later translated into sophisticated multicomponent in vivo vectors.4,5",

The most obvious approach, originally proposed by Zamecnik and Stevenson,13 is antisense binding through Watson-Crick base pairing to messenger RNA (mRNA) to block translational initiation or elongation and thus decrease the levels of the corresponding protein (Figure 1a). Steric blocking of ribosomal elongation is known to be hard to achieve, but blocking of ribosomal initiation can be efficient by targeting the initiator AUG region, the 5\u2032-cap region, or, where appropriate, an internal ribosome entry site. It is also possible to block polyadenylation.14 Such targeting requires delivery of oligonucleotides in stoichiometric amount to that of the targeted mRNA present in the cell at a given time. Steric blocking also requires the use of strongly binding oligonucleotide analogues to ensure good competition for the mRNA with the proteins involved in translation or other cellular processes.",

This mode of action is limited to those oligonucleotides containing a minimum stretch of 6\u201310 unmodified DNA or PS DNA units (known as gapmers), but outer nucleotides can be more heavily modified to enhance complementary RNA binding. In principle, catalytic turnover allows a lower concentration of oligonucleotides to be used compared to steric-blocking oligonucleotides.

Interestingly, good levels of intracellular activity have been achieved without requiring CPP-assisted delivery both in cell culture and in vivo (e.g., for peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and locked nucleic acid (LNA)),19,20 in contrast to naked oligonucleotides targeting mRNA, where high concentrations and extended periods are required in cell culture for RNase-H\u2013dependent activity when delivered gymnotically (from Greek: gymnos, meaning naked).21 Oligonucleotides targeting miRNAs have been shown to rapidly enter cells and interfere with miRNA activity at submicromolar concentrations.19,22 Current thinking is that the oligonucleotide may meet the miRNA somewhere within the endosomal pathway,20 and therefore CPP-enhanced endosomal release may be unnecessary, although the generality of this conclusion for all cell types and miRNAs is yet to be established. Inhibition of miRNA is thought to occur by miRNA sequestration rather than by degradation.20 Therapeutic applications of anti-miRs have been recently reviewed.23 An alternative mechanism has also proven successful, where a short oligonucleotide binds the mRNA to cover the miRNA-binding site to again prevent RISC binding and subsequent mRNA downregulation (Figure 1e).24",

An oligonucleotide directed to regions at, or close to, a splice site can mask normal or aberrant splicing events leading either to exon exclusion (Figure 1f) or exon inclusion (Figure 1g). Splicing redirection model systems have been used very successfully to monitor peptide-mediated oligonucleotide delivery.25,26 In addition, the methodology is already being assessed in the clinic for treatment of neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases where targeting of specific exons in mutated dystrophin pre-mRNA with antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotides (PMO) allows redirection of the splicing pattern to restore a correct reading frame (exon skipping), resulting in the regeneration of functional dystrophin protein expression.27 Stimulation of exon inclusion by antisense oligonucleotides is an alternative mechanism being examined for potential treatment for spinal muscular atrophy.28 In addition, exon skipping can be applied to wild-type genes to generate out-of-frame transcripts as a method of normal protein downregulation.29",

This approach was initially favored in therapeutic design, because cleavage diminishes the risk of any detrimental effect of the peptide on the interaction of the oligonucleotide with its target.

This is partly because the vector protects the siRNA from rapid degradation as well as helps the siRNA to passage into the cell and be released from endosomes. A simple peptide-based complexation vector is attractive compared to the better known but more complex lipid-based or polymeric nanoparticle vectors in terms of simplicity and cost of components.

However, delivery to muscle for example with naked oligonucleotide analogues, including PMO and PNA, requires very high dosages in animals to obtain any activity (see for example the muscular dystrophy applications described later) and here the substantial improvement in in vivo activity afforded by covalent peptide conjugation easily outweighs the added cost and effort of conjugation.

Conjugation of siRNA with the SPACE peptide led to enhanced skin-absorptive properties and knockdown of corresponding protein targets.87 It is hoped to use such conjugates to treat atopic dermatitis.

Despite reassuring results that PNA-peptides targeted to the HIV-1 trans-activation responsive element are nontoxic in mice at high (300 mg/kg) doses,97 antiviral development seems recently to have ceased for PNA peptides. By contrast, RXR4 and B-peptide conjugates of PMO oligonucleotides have recently shown high antiviral activities both in cell culture and in vivo in various systems (Table 4). For example, P-PMO conjugates interfered with splicing of hemagglutinin-activating protease TMPRSS2 pre-mRNA and suppressed viral titers by two to three log10 units in Influenza A cultures.98 Similarly, RXR4-PMOs blocked viral replication of human respiratory syncytial viruses both in cells and in BALB/c mice.99 Here, the PMO sequence was targeted to the start of the coding region. Interestingly, there was also reduction in lung viral titers even with treatment of mice 3 hours after infection, but not 8 hours after infection. This suggests the PMO needs to be present in the cell soon after infection if it is to have an impact on virus production.",

In particular, Arg-rich peptides conjugated to PMO are able to penetrate the cell outer membrane and display gene-specific antibiotic activity in gram-negative bacteria.105 The peptide\u2013PMO conjugates are able to reduce bacterial blood titers and increase survival in Escherichia coli infected mice.106,107 Very recently, a novel 22-residue Arg-rich peptide derived from human T cells, when conjugated to PMO targeting GyrA was able to induce broad range bacterial cell killing at concentrations much lower than required for activity by other Arg-rich peptide-PMOs.108 The higher than perhaps anticipated activity is attributed to non-gene\u2013specific RNA targeting of the P-PMO in addition to a gene specific effect, suggesting partial bacteriocidal activity plays an important role here. Interestingly, PMO containing positive charges in the PMO backbone also have antisense activity but did not achieve the same efficiency as peptide-conjugated PMO.109",

Although such PEGylation significantly stabilizes polyplexes, it unfortunately often results in lower potency, due to inadequate cellular uptake and poor endosomal escape.117,118 Another strategy for stabilization of polyplexes involves use of hydrophobic modifications. For example, partial modifications of amines in PEI with tyrosine stabilize polyplexes significantly increases transfection of both siRNAs and splice-redirecting 2\u2032-OMe oligonucleotides.119,120 Analogously, modification of polyamines with hydrophobic acrylates results in stabilization of cores for highly efficient siRNA and 2\u2032-OMe anti-miR delivery in vivo.121,122",

In order to facilitate endosomal escape, imidazole groups were incorporated on the ends of the polymer to act as proton sponges. For systemic delivery, the polymer was stabilized by inclusion of surface-functionalized PEG moieties. In contrast to other polymeric delivery systems, the CDP approach relies on noncovalent incorporation of PEG via conjugation to adamantane, a small molecule that forms a high affinity inclusion complex with cyclodextrin. Finally, in order to confer tissue targeting to solid tumors, the surface of CDP was coated with adamantane conjugated to the transferrin ligand for targeting of transferrin receptors that are expressed abundantly on the surface of tumors.135",

In particular, the inclusion of Arg-rich CPPs on such liposomes has proven as a potent strategy to enhance transfections.10,138 In a recent example of peptide-mediated siRNA delivery, liposomal nanoparticles that are octaarginine-modified was used to encapsulate siRNA and to silence an endogenous gene in liver cells as well as in vivo at low concentrations of siRNA (25 \u00b5g/mouse) using a single dose, without evidence for liver toxicity.140 In another example, cationic liposomes were modified by a chimeric peptide containing 16 lysine residues and a short multicell targeting peptide Y and used to deliver siRNA against luciferase and GAPDH targets.141",

In addition to surface modification with PEG, peptide delivery vectors have been incorporated on to the surface of such liposomes using a stearylated peptide that spontaneously inserts into the lipid membrane. Novel versions of MEND contain cleavable PEG linkers as well as targeting peptides for specific receptors or fusogenic peptides, in order to confer targeting of specific tissues and controlled release of encapsulated cargoes (reviewed in ref. 118). MEND has been efficiently exploited for delivery of unmodified single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides in cells as well as siRNAs both in cells and ex vivo in dendritic cells.142,143,144 Very recently, an even more sophisticated MEND system was efficiently utilized for systemic, targeted delivery of siRNA to tumors.145",

In vivo biodistribution data can be derived either by the assessment of an induced biological affect, by the detection of a directly labeled bio-cargo, or by use of a transgenic animal reporter system, yet each method has caveats in their use. Measurement of an induced biological affect is restricted to those tissues where the transcript targeted by the oligonucleotide or siRNA is expressed, for example, using dystrophin exon skipping and protein restoration as a read-out in the mdx mouse model.75 Fluorescent molecules or radioactive isotopes have been used successfully to label and follow the biodistribution of peptide conjugates of biocargoes such as PNA.157 However it is important to note that where the peptide part only is labeled, label detection may not always correlate with the location of the bioactive cargo. For example, a recent report of an N-terminally FITC-labeled B-PMO having crossed the blood-brain barrier and reaching Purkinje cells in wild-type mice should be viewed with caution until confirmed by other methods.158 An EGFP-654 transgenic mouse model that ubiquitously expresses an aberrantly spliced EGFP-654 pre-mRNA reporter gene has been used to assess functional biodistribution of B-PMO.159 However, such distribution assessments might not reflect the potential of a peptide-PMO to influence a disease pathology, whereas in an animal model of a disease such as DMD this becomes less of an issue. Nevertheless the use of all three of these techniques together can provide valuable information in building a view of how a peptide affects biodistribution of an oligonucleotide cargo.",

However, peptide-PMO acts as a good case study. Here the PMO cargo has an amazingly good safety profile in animals and in many clinical trials.37,163,164 Thus the safety profile of a P-PMO conjugate will depend almost entirely upon the specific peptide sequence and is assessed in the context of the therapeutic dose required in a particular clinical setting. Amantana et al. investigated the safety profile in rats of an anti-c-myc PMO conjugated to the RXR4 CPP. Although lower doses of the CPP-PMO were well tolerated (15 mg/kg), adverse events such as lethargy, weight loss, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels were reported at much higher doses (150 mg/kg), with a lethal dose reported as 400 mg/kg.165 Toxicity has also been reported in non-human primates following a preclinical study with the B-PMO peptide conjugate developed by AVI BioPharma. Dose-dependent toxicity was observed in healthy Cynomolgus monkeys with four weekly intravenous injections of 9 mg/kg, causing tubular degeneration in the kidneys (AVI BioPharma website www.aviobio.com).63 No toxic effect was observed at higher doses in mdx mice, thus highlighting that the P-PMO toxicity threshold varies between species. Although lower toxic thresholds have been reported elsewhere, comparisons between studies assessing the use of CPPs to deliver non-oligomers are problematic, because the effect of the cargo cannot be distinguished from that of the CPP.166",

However, there are no examples yet of any of these reaching clinical trials apart from the application involving the human transferrin protein used in siRNA particle formation which was recently reported in the clinic.134 The application of short peptides in siRNA delivery applications needs to overcome remaining obstacles of reproducible and validated manufacture of the overall vectors. In addition, there needs to be better control of off-target effects that lead to toxicities. Peptide-based ligands displayed on such vectors are bound to feature more in clinical development in the near future and these are already helping to gain greater tissue and targeting specificity. It is hoped that further preclinical development studies here will be published soon to help move such therapies to the clinic as rapidly as possible.",
