The commonly used English word \u201cdisaster\u201d originates from the Latin words \u201cdis-astrum,\u201d meaning \u201cominous star.\u201d Disaster, as it is reflected in its origin, had been historically interpreted and used as a massive and sudden calamity due to the unfavorable position of a planet or star, implying \u201cimpossible to control,\u201d because it is caused by God\u2019s will (Etkin 2015). In other words, disaster had been mostly considered as a naturally occurring disaster, resulting from external components, such as typhoons and earthquakes. Currently, it has matured to include technological and social disasters, reflecting the evolutionary circumstances of the contemporary society.",

In Korea, the Disasters and Safety Act defines disaster as \u201cwhat causes or is likely to cause any harm to the lives, bodies, and property of citizens and the State.\u201d The first appearance of the definition of disaster in Korean law was in the Countermeasures against Typhoons and Floods Act (Act No. 1894), enacted on February 28, 1967, where the Korean word \u201cjaehae\u201d was defined as \u201cdamage caused by a flood, downpour, heavy snowfall, storm, or tidal wave, and other natural phenomena equivalent thereto.\u201d In this Act, the English word \u201cdisaster\u201d was interpreted to be the Korean word \u201cjaehae,\u201d meaning disaster triggered by natural hazard. This Act was fully revised into the Countermeasures against Natural Disasters Act (Act No. 4993) on December 6, 1995, defining \u201cdisaster\u201d as \u201cdamage caused by a typhoon, flood, downpour, storm, tidal wave, heavy snowfall, drought, or earthquake (including tsunami), and other natural phenomena equivalent thereto.\u201d",

According to Fritz, \u201cdisaster is an event, concentrated in time and space, in which a society of a relatively self-sufficient subdivision of society, undergoes severe danger and incurs such losses to its members and physical appurtenances that the social structure is disrupted and the fulfillment of all or some of the essential functions of the society is prevented (Fritz 1961).\u201d Quarantelli (1985) acknowledged disaster as occupying time and space, as a social phenomenon when society or a small community cannot perform all or part of its social functions due to the result of the impact occurring from natural or technological causes that cannot be managed by the knowledge or capability of the society or a small community Table 2.1 summarizes the various concepts of disaster as described above.\n",

Medical disasters or disease disasters refer to chemical disasters that cause hindrance to respiratory organs and metabolic systems due to the leakage of chemicals, radioactive matters, or toxic agents. This classification method has significance in that it is possible to predict the conditions of the patients in disasters and effectively manage medical resources accordingly (Kim and Lim 1995).",

The 1995 Sampoong Department Store collapse accident in Korea is a typical example of the Heinrich\u2019s Law. The accident happened because no countermeasures had been taken even though there were many signals before the accident. The department store opened its business with inborn structural problems during the construction process: about 76 tons of installation equipment was installed on the rooftop, which was four times more than its original design load, and reinforcing bars were out of place. Along with problematic construction, poor management was another cause of the accident: minor symptoms such as cracks in the ceilings and damage to the floor of the rooftop (potential elements of 300) were overlooked by staff and maintenance crews. In addition, although customers and employees raised several concerns about the general health of the building, such as vibrating sound from an air conditioner and many cracks in the wall, no specific actions were taken, even after receiving evaluations from experts (29 small accidents). Neglecting potential elements eventually led to one huge accident with 1000 casualties (one massive accident) (Lee et al. 2008).",

Ulrich Beck, the German sociologist, suggested the concept of risk society as a solution to structural and deep-rooted problems of industrial societies, including science and technical safety issues, which started in the mid-1980s (Lee et al. 2008). In his book World Risk Society (1999), Ulrich Beck argued that the modern society is a \u201crisk society\u201d replete with risks all throughout and emphasized the multiplication of cross border risks and international dangers that single nation-states cannot tackle on their own (Beck 1999). During his lecture at Seoul National University in 2008, Beck pointed out the similarities between the Asian Financial Crisis in the 1990s and the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant accident in 1986, stressing the importance that all nations must work together to reduce the global risk on the basis of a common understanding that they are facing the same global risk. Beck also considers this emerging risk as a result of the de-bounding of traditional national boundaries in the spatial, temporal, and social dimensions. Beck defined risk society as a society where socially produced risk is inherently accompanied by socially produced wealth (Oh 2013). He also insisted that industrial society should be addressed through a comprehensive perspective, which includes social, historical, and technological views (Beck 1986).",

Due to a heavy rain, combined with low topographic characteristics of Thailand and high tide of seawater, two thirds of the land in Thailand, including parts of Bangkok, was flooded, causing significant damage to the entire manufacturing industry. The 2011 flood did not affect just Thailand. For example, many Japanese companies\u2019 production facilities located in the central region, having developed the area for the manufacturing of automotive and electronic goods, were inundated during the flood. The intensity of the flooding caused all of the facilities to be shut down, which caused tremendous economic loss for both countries. Additionally, the shutdown of the automotive plants caused a reduction of Japanese auto and parts deliveries to other major markets like Japan, the USA, and Europe. In case of the electric and electronic industry, hard disks became in short supply due to flooding of hard disk manufacturing factories. Due to this, the production of semiconductors by Intel became inadequate, resulting in a short supply of semiconductors to the world\u2019s semiconductor market. Moreover, it caused a price increase of computers worldwide. Also, since the severe flood occurred right before the tourist season, the number of tourists in the fourth quarter decreased by approximately 20%, and additionally induced damages occurred in other industries, such as transportation and food services. Due to the influence of the heavy flood, the estimated economic growth rate of Thailand in 2011 was lowered from 3.8% to 2.1% (Korea Institute for International Economic Policy 2011). Table 2.6 shows the summary of damage that occurred to the Japanese economy due to the heavy flood in Thailand. This table shows that the flood was not just problematic for Thailand but indicates that a disaster occurring in one country does influence other countries.\n",

The Theory was accepted through the National Performance Review project during the Clinton Administration, and laid the foundation for FEMA\u2019s reformation (Waugh and Streib 2006). The demand for the reformation of FEMA started from Hurricane Hugo, which hit North Carolina and the Virgin Islands in 1989, causing $15 billion in damages. In the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck California, a fire broke out in Oakland, and Hurricane Andrew struck Florida and Louisiana, dealing a massive blow to the two states. Disappointed by FEMA\u2019s ineffective response to these massive natural disasters, political groups and citizens in the USA raised the need to improve FEMA\u2019s performance, which was endorsed by the Clinton Administration in 1993 (Anna et al. 2006).",

Since then, the international community has been working for developing a systematic disaster management framework; disaster response plan, disaster prevention measures, and scientific and technical solutions to disaster risk have been discussed and adopted. In particular, technical approaches, such as vulnerability analysis for disasters and early warning measures, have been tried. Additionally, the scientific approach played a key role in the evolution of disaster management through a variety of research on how to identify hazard and assess vulnerability (UNISDR 2013).",

The USA reformed its DRM system after 9/11 in 2001, shifting from a typical natural and human-caused disaster management paradigm to comprehensive security (Park and Cho 2013). Within this context, since the 2000s, civil defense and civil protection became important concepts in disaster management. Civil defense was originally designed to protect citizens from calamities, such as war, but it was gradually expanded to encompass DRM, reducing civilian casualties during disasters. Alexander (2006) suggested that the role of the state and the civilian in disaster preparedness be shifted from Civil Defense to Civil Protection. This is because Civil Protection is an appropriate concept to reinforce the protection of people against external risks, meeting the need to protect people from typical disasters, such as natural and technological disasters, as well as emerging risks, such as new infectious diseases, terrorism, and cyber attacks, while Civil Defense was useful to cope with the invasion of an outside force which was a severe threat during the Cold War era.",

When a national government provides public safety services, it usually prefers to use a top-down approach: command and control, a hierarchical decision-making system excluding citizen\u2019s participation, strengthening law and order, and rules through the principle of confidentiality. However, the civil protection concept by Alexander put stress on a bottom-up approach: emergency preparedness and response ensuring public participation and cooperation, problem-solving approach, and openness principles. As a result, risk governance is the most critical issue in civil protection, ensuring the cooperative interaction among the government, the private sector, and civil organizations to replace the existing hierarchical bureaucratic system. Alexander (2006) addressed Hurricane Katrina as a typical failure case of Civil Defense with a top-down approach, requesting a shift from a top-down approach to a bottom-up approach, along with improved risk governance.",
