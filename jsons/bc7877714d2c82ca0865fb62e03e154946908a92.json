The academic virologist must therefore regard clinical and public health advocacy as at least as important as dwelling upon his/her particular loci of research, and they must offer their students a broad grasp of the ecology of virus infections. For almost all of their students this will be more important than the minutiae of virus genomics. The students of today are the clinical decisiontakers of tomorrow, and they need to understand the interface between virus pathogens and humans.",

Each could be said to represent an experiential failure in the teaching of virology as it applies to clinical medicine and public health. An egregious example was the acceptance for publication in 1998 of a paper about the supposed consequences for 12 children in the aftermath of their MMR vaccination. That single article has done untold damage to world immunisation schedules which shows little sign of abating. When this outcome was analysed in-depth in 2010 1 a basic question had not, even by then, been answered satisfactorily, that is, 'How was an ambitious clinical researcher's urge to publish allowed to override proper caution when the claims made were so implausible?' Attenuated vaccine strains, from Jenner's vaccinia and Theiler's 17D yellow fever vaccine through to MMR should not have been expected to cause complications never seen in the equivalent wild infections unless there was much firmer evidence.",

UK Departments of Health proposed that tamiflu should be prescribed to influenza-vulnerable groups as a prophylactic on a continuing basis. This was an expensive error due to the failure to give a strong and specific indication for its use. An antiviral for influenza is only likely to be effective if part of very timely treatment, or prophylactically as soon as an exposure is recognised.",

            "text": "Some basic virological truths remain ill-understood by the medical profession. One is the speed and scale with which viruses propagate themselves, and the implications for onward transmission of viral pathogens, whether \"horizontally\" or from mother to child. For example, hepatitis B carriers can have a blood virus burden of ten orders of magnitude per millilitre, that is, a hundred million virions. Even for those viruses that the immune response quickly suppresses viraemia may transiently be superabundant, and it is then that most transmissions will occur. It would also be helpful to more narrowly define the incubation periods of virus infections avoiding making them impractically wide, as well as identifying when infectiousness is likely to be greatest. Antiviral combinations are now being found that will suppress viraemia, often to the point at which transmission is negated. These have, for instance, opened up opportunities to interrupt the spread of HIV. 2 In England and Wales, reported incidence of HIV has almost quartered since 2012, 3 tion then came into prominence. 8, 9 None of this catalogue of virological problems needs rocket science to explain them or respond to them; but in the few weeks that virologists are allotted to educate medical and other students the emphasis must be on virus ecology. The means of virus exposure, susceptibility, and transmissibility; of virus treatment and prophylaxis; and of scope for control of virus spread and even elimination: these are the knowledge base needed by future decision-takers, whether to be used at the bedside or in the contexts of national and international public health. Educating the students who are not going to be virologists is the academic virologist's greatest challenge. ",

            "text": "mostly due to the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis. For the otherwise mortal Ebola infection, antiviral combinations and vaccine have made intensive care and treatment a realistic approach even in the poorly resourced and politically uncertain environments where that virus has recently been, or still is, active. 4,5 Tumour virology is a mostly neglected topic in the medical undergraduate curriculum. It is more than a century ago that Peyton Rous showed that a virus caused chicken sarcoma. Much more recently, tests for papilloma virus types 16/18 have become accepted as the earliest prophylactic tool in human cervical cancer prevention, and teenage immunisation promises to eliminate these high risk infections. Infant hepatitis B virus infection mediates liver cancer: how best, then, to identify and reach the appropriate target groups and vaccinate them? 6 The virological consequences of two pressing realities of the 21st century, human population growth and climatic instability, are now manifest. The expansion of the mega-cities of South and South-East Asia, Africa, and South America is bringing humans and the species that we may share virus susceptibilities with into close contact. viruses, and for the current 2019nCoV epidemic: all are examples of what may happen at the interface between humans, animals, and, in the case of influenza A, birds when they come into intimate contact. A previous editorial in this journal compared the origin of SARS with that of MERS. 7 As this editorial is being drafted, Chinese authorities and international bodies are grappling with the spread of 2019nCoV, an animal coronavirus which appears to have acquired a greater capacity to transmit between humans than either of them. It is about to be seen whether China, a country uniquely able to impose self-quarantine on its population, can interrupt the national spread of 2019nCoV infection. Throughout the Tropics, climate change and territorial encroachment are expanding the range of vector-borne infections. In 2016-2017, sub-clinical infection with Zika virus became very widespread in parts of Brazil and neighbouring states, and the previously unacknowledged clinical consequences of maternal Zika virus infec-",
