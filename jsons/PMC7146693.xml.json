The pathological and physiological processes and diagnostic methods of COVID-19 are still in the exploratory stage. Clinical monitoring and appropriate treatment strategies were essential to improve case fatality. CT scan played an important role in assessing the disease [2]. Other sensitive indicators able to reflect lung lesion changes and disease severity had to be explored. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels can be used in the early diagnosis of pneumonia [3], and patients presenting with severe pneumonia had high CRP levels. We assessed the correlation between CRP levels, lung lesions, and disease severity to provide reference for clinical treatment.",

COVID-19-related case fatality is also rapidly increasing. COVID-19 is a new threat for populations [6], [7], [8], and treatment options need to be evaluated [9]. Early monitoring of key indicators was an important basis to guide treatment strategies, and early assessment of the severity of patients\u2019 condition was of great value [10]. The main pathological changes of COVID-19 are lung and immune system damage [4]. Serous, fibrin exudate and clear membrane form in the alveolar cavity and congestion and edema appear in the lung [11]. CT dynamic monitoring may be used to identify the characteristic imaging of lung changes: multiple small patch shadows and stromal changes are observed in the early stage and the lung exudate is obvious [12], which then develops into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltrating shadows in both lungs [13]. CT scan examination, as a quick and simple method to screen for pulmonary infection, cannot only determine the presence of pulmonary infection but it can also provide a reference for determining the type of pathogen, with unique diagnostic advantages. According to Zhong Nanshan's latest research, the sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnosis with CT scan alone was 76.4%, and the application of CT scan in COVID-19 was evaluated as useful [14]. A 50% increase in lung X-ray findings within 24 to 48 hours was considered an early warning indicator of impending conversion to critical disease. The CT scan can sometimes predict the prognosis of patients [15]. Studies by Chen Lin et al. all suggested the value of the CT scan in the diagnosis and evaluation of COVID-19 [2]. Shortcomings of CT scan are the additional special protection required by medical personnel during examination of COVID-19 patients, the cost of protective equipment, and risks associated with the transportation and examination of critical patients. CT dynamic monitoring of lung lesions was limited. A simple index with good correlation with pulmonary pathological changes is required.",
