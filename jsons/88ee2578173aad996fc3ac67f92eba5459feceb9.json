First we present the problem of finding the expected s-t first arrival time using the generating function approach (see Section 2) . Second we establish in Section 3 the relationship between the spread process and the stochastic shortest s-t path problem stated in [9, Chapter 9] ). In Section 4 we introduce the s-t spreading resistance of a graph. We show that this notion is related to Kulkarni's concept [4] of the expected length of a shortest s-t path, whenever the edge lengths are exponentially distributed random variables with intensity p. Subsequently, we establish two reduction techniques for calculating the expected first arrival time in s-t series-parallel graphs (see Section 6) . Due to the computational complexity of the spread process, we propose in Section 7 methods for yielding lower and upper bounds for the expected s-t first arrival time in terms of the s-t reliability polynomial and the distance between s and t.",

In order to prove this estimate, we assume an elementary event E in {Z st \u2264 d(s, t) + k \u2212 1}, e.g. a realisation of edge lengths, so that the length of a shortest s-t path is smaller or equal than d(s, t) + k \u2212 1. In order that E occurs there must be at least one s-t path in G, so that the sum of the edge lengths of the path is smaller or equal than d(s, t) + k \u2212 1. Therefore all edge lengths of this s-t path must be smaller than k, as if there would be one edge length in this path that is greater than k + 1, then the sum of the path lengths would exceed (k + 1) + (d(s, t) \u2212 1), which contradicts the assumption Z st \u2264 d(s, t) + k \u2212 1. As all edge lengths are smaller than k, the event E is by definition also in {I st \u2264 k}, i.e. G k must also contains this s-t path. Furthermore the probabilities for the event E coincide in both probability spaces, so that (13) follows. Due to (13), we find that the expectation of the random variable I st is smaller than the expectation of the random variable Z st \u2212 d(s, t) + 1. Hence, In order to show the relationship between E[I st ] and the s-t reliability polynomial, consider the edge e = {u, v} and the event {L(e) \u2264 k}. We easily find that Pr({L(e) \u2264 k}) = 1 \u2212 q k , whenever the non insertion probability is q. Assume now that there are k parallel edges between u and v, that are failing independently with probability q, then the probability that there is at least one non failing edge is also given by 1\u2212 q k . Therefore, the probability for the event {I st > k} coincides with the probability of the event that there is no s-t path in the multigraph G(k), where G(k) emerges from G by replacing each edge in G with k parallel edges.

As the events {Z st (H) > n} and {Z st (K) > n} are independent, we haveMultiplying both sides of the above equation with z n and summation over all n \u2265 0 yieldswhich leads after rearranging terms to the desired result.We apply the parallel reduction for the series-parallel graph G with s and t as its start and terminal vertices such that {s, t} forms a vertex separating pair. The subsequent result deals with the case that one of the two subgraphs of G is a path of length r \u2265 1.Corollary 25. Let G = (V, E) be a graph and {s, t} a separating vertex pair of G, furthermore assume that H and K are subgraphs of G with G = H \u222a K and H \u2229 K = ({s, t}, \u2205) and that K is a path of length r connecting s and t. Then the following equations hold:PROOF. For the first arrival times of the path K of length r in G, one findsBy Theorem 24, the ordinary generating function for the first arrival time of G yieldsAfter evaluating the formal derivative at z = 1 we obtainAnother instance of the parallel reduction technique is given by two parallel paths of lengths n and m between s and t.Corollary 26. Let G = (V, E) be the graph that consists of two parallel paths of lengths n \u2265 1 and m \u2265 1 between the vertices s, t \u2208 V where m \u2265 n. ThenPROOF. Let \u03a6 st (P \u2113 , z) be the ordinary generating function for the s-t first arrival time in a path of length \u2113. Then the ratio \u03a6 st (P \u2113 , z)/(1 \u2212 z) becomesby Equation (11) and the application of partial fraction decomposition. With \u2113 = n and \u2113 = m, it follows from the parallel reduction technique thatThe desired result now follows by applying Lemma 23 to (12). PROOF.
