Furthermore, these cell lines helped define various phenotypic and genetic characteristics of human tumours, e.g. epithelioid or sarcomatoid (Table 18 .1). Human cell lines provided information regarding the resistance of mesothelioma to cytotoxic drugs such as actinomycin D, cisplatin, etoposide, methotrexate, 5'fluorouracil, mitomycin C, and vinblastine. Further human cell line studies determined the response of mesothelioma cells to cytokines including TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, and IFN\u03b1, indicating reduced proliferation of some cell lines. Later notable immunology studies included stimulation of cytotoxic T cells or natural killer (NK) cells with cytokines to stimulate tumour cell killing. This led to the notion that immunotherapeutic approaches to mesothelioma may be more effective in vivo rather than assayed by direct anti-tumour activity on cell lines.",

Mesothelioma is particularly resistant to chemotherapy, an outcome not always accurately reflected when using in vitro monolayer cultures. Conversely, 3D spheroid cultures have shown chemotherapy resistance profiles similar to that observed in patients. However, the use of 3D cultures is still limited by the intrinsic complications associated with quantifying cell survival. Other in vitro models include primary cell culture using single cells isolated from patients that are cultured for a short period of time. These cultures, often taken from pleural effusions, more closely represent the original tumour in cell complexity, cytology, and cellular biology. In some hands, primary tumour cultures have resistance to drug treatment mirroring the clinical setting (Schunselaar et al. 2016) . However, establishing primary tissue cultures is often difficult, and in vitro resistance to drug treatment is extremely variable between patients.",

Subsequently, a continuous inflammatory cycle of pleural irritation, DNA damage, and repair leads to mutations in mesothelial cells leading to the onset of disease. Inflammatory cytokines, including transforming growth factor-\u03b2, (TGF-\u03b2), plateletderived growth factor (PDGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promote proliferation and angiogenesis. Phagocytosis of asbestos fibres leads to release of oxygen free radicals inducing DNA mutations, and fibre penetration of mesothelial cells interferes with mitosis. Not all individuals exposed to asbestos develop mesothelioma, suggesting host genetics may predispose some individuals to disease. Rodents, particularly mice, from different genetic backgrounds have been exposed to asbestos fibres and monitored for development of mesothelioma. Strikingly, asbestos-induced mesothelioma in mice recapitulates the human disease with regard to disease latency, growth of tumour on the mesothelium, histopathology, and chromosomal abnormalities (see Sect. 2.5 below). Many murine cell lines have since been developed from asbestos-exposed mice (Table 18 .1) and have contributed significantly to our current understanding of mesothelioma biology.",

Firstly, it is often difficult to regulate the number of asbestos fibres inhaled. Additionally, there is a high asbestos exposure risk to research staff and the immediate study environment. As such, inhalation studies often require specialised equipment and facilities at a cost that is often prohibitive to many research labs. Conversely, instillation of asbestos fibres via intraperitoneal (i.p.), intrapleural (i.pl), or intratracheal (i.tr) injection is more common as it is costeffective and easily performed with minimal training. Both models are equally important, and it is the hypothesis being tested that should dictate which type of model is ultimately used. When investigating the potential carcinogenicity of airborne particles on human health, an inhalation study is warranted. However, when investigating biological processes that occur once disease is induced, injection models are no less useful; how the disease is induced is not the primary concern, but what happens biologically afterwards is.",

These models closely resemble the onset of human disease in terms of disease incidence (20-30% of exposed mice) and histological and morphological features, with the notable exception that unlike human mesothelioma, most mouse-derived mesotheliomas are sarcomatoid, with very little epithelioid or biphasic subtypes observed (Robinson et al. 2006) . Nonetheless, these models have significantly aided our understanding of the mechanisms leading to onset of mesothelioma. Although many mouse exposure models recapitulate human mesothelioma, the low disease incidence (20-30% of exposed mice), and long latency period lag time to disease onset, is prolonged (0.5-2 years); asbestos exposure models are therefore inappropriate for many investigations such as molecular tumourigenesis and drug testing.",

Accordingly, mouse models have been developed in which these genes, either individually or in combination, are no longer expressed, i.e. the genes have been 'knocked out' (KO models). Mice in which a single copy of NF2 or p53 have been deleted (heterozygous KO mice) display increased incidence of mesothelioma (up to 80% of mice) and a shorter disease latency following asbestos exposure. Importantly, both NF2 and p53 heterozygous mice develop other types of highly metastatic lesions (Cleo Robinson et al. 2014) and other spontaneous cancers, such as lymphomas, sarcomas, and adenocarcinomas. It is also notable that these mouse models don't require exposure to asbestos for disease development and become complicated by spontaneous occurrence of many non-mesothelioma tumours. Whilst a disadvantage of these models is the induction of mesothelioma in the absence of asbestos exposure, they have still been instrumental in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that lead to mesothelioma following asbestos exposure.",

Whilst SV40 does not play a causative role in human mesothelioma, we utilise the oncogenic potential of TAg as a disease accelerator, producing a mouse model in which mesothelioma development is predictable, uniform, and reproducible, but only after asbestos exposure. MexTAg mice have higher disease incidence (up to 100%), develop mesothelioma with similar pathology, and show comparable treatment responses to human mesothelioma (Robinson et al. 2006 (Robinson et al. , 2011 . Importantly, MexTAg mice are less likely to develop unrelated tumours compared to wild-type mice or the heterozygous or conditional mesothelioma knockout mouse models mentioned above. Expression analysis comparing MexTAg and wild-type mesotheliomas with their counterpart normal mesothelial cells demonstrates highly homologous gene expression profiles that suggest the TAg transgene does not affect the overall mechanism of mesothelioma development, but rather it phenocopies p16 loss -leading to increased disease incidence in these mice after asbestos exposure . Thus, the MexTAg model is a functional equivalent of the deletion of tumour suppressor genes such as CDKN2A (p16 INK4a /p14 Arf ), NF2, BAP1, or p53 that characterise human mesothelioma. The reproducibility and high incidence of disease in asbestos-exposed MexTAg mice make this model ideal for disease prevention studies as well as assessing the potential carcinogenicity of minerals and materials that share asbestos-like characteristics such as long carbon nanotubes and non-asbestiform elongated mineral particles (Table 18 .2).",

This is unsurprising as many patients selected for EPP are already high risk, and the procedure has a relative risk for technical complications including haemorrhage, empyema, failure at reconstruction of the diaphragms or pericardium, atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Radiotherapy is also prophylactically used for biopsy tract metastases, which occur in around 20% of patients, but this is controversial and studies to date have been largely negative.

Tumour biopsies with high levels of CD8 + tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are positively correlated with tumour regression and improved survival. However, despite the infiltration of T effector (Teff) cells, tumours can escape elimination by the immune system through the involvement of T cell inhibitory molecules (CLTA-4 or PD-1, PD-L2), or the development of a suppressive tumour microenvironment (TME), characterised by high levels of Treg cells (Fisher et al. 2017 ) and suppressive cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10. New strategies for the treatment of cancer include therapies that target the immune system. The recognition of tumour by the immune system occurs in several stages (Figs. 18.1 and 18.2) . Initially the immune system recognises tumour cells via direct presentation of tumour antigens in MHCI molecules on the tumour itself or via presentation of antigen on dendritic cells leading to activation of CD8 T cells in the lymph nodes. The activated CD8 T cells then traffic to the tumour site and are further presented with tumour antigen, via tumour cells or antigen-presenting cells. Following antigen exposure CD8 T cells then produce granzyme B and perforin in an anti-tumour cytotoxic response. However, at each stage of the immune process, there are checks in place to suppress or control the anti-tumour response. These checks to inhibit the immune response can be provided by tumour cells, antigenpresenting cells, immunosuppressive cells (i.e. Treg, MDSC), and/or the cytokine milieu.",

A good biomarker needs to be preferentially expressed at a relatively high level on mesothelioma cells and detected with high sensitivity and specificity. An ideal biomarker would be detectable in the serum of asbestos-exposed individuals at early stages of disease, prior to radiological confirmation of disease. Candidate mesothelioma biomarkers include mesothelin, osteopontin, fibulin-3, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Mesothelin is highly expressed on mesothelioma cells with low-level expression on some normal tissues (Robinson and Lake 2005) . In mesothelioma patients, soluble mesothelin was detected in the blood with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 95%. As a predictive marker however, soluble mesothelin decreases to below an acceptable limit with only 75% of patients' serum positive at diagnosis, and patients with sarcomatoid phenotype have low or undetectable SM throughout disease. Importantly, after therapy decreased SM levels do correlate with surgical tumour debulking, response to therapy, or improved overall survival (Arnold and Maskell 2018) .",
