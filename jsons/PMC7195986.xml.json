At the end of the First World War, Spanish flu caused many more deaths than all the troops. The pandemic has widespread to all continents with the mobilization of the military troops. Although pandemics in mankind history spread mostly along trade and communication lines, the spread of the 1918 Spanish flu was transmitted from region to region through military mobilization and trench warfare, limited health services poor sanitation made easy transmission [2].",

Many countries experienced the second and third waves of more virulent form of infection. It is estimated that 50% of the world\u2019s population have infected, 25% manifested clinical signs [4]. After almost forty years of Spanish flu, a new influenza strain was detected in China. The 1957 pandemic was caused by A H2N2 strain [5]. The virus spread to Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Japan and in summer spread to world in the summer of 1957. Two main routes of spread were: firstly, across Russia to Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, and secondly from the US to other countries. Asian flu pandemic had spread to the world in 6 months. The pandemic affected approximately 40 \u00b1 50% of people, and 25 \u00b1 30% of them had clinical signs. Most of the deaths were due to secondary bacterial pneumonia. Mortality rate was calculated as 1 per 4000. The mortality was high among children and elderly people [1].

Virus was spread through Vietnam War veterans returning to the United States. Then Hong Kong flu was seen in Japan, England, Wales, Australia, and Canada in 1969 [8,9]. At this pandemic the characteristic mortality shift towards younger populations, the case fatality rate was highest among children [10]. Hong Kong flu is estimated to have caused between 500,000 and two million deaths worldwide in two waves [11]. The burden of pandemic was higher in countries with increases in excess all-cause mortality of 9.1%\u201313.0%, than in US. Impact of pandemic was present the geographic heterogeneity [8].

The global trade and travel served swine flu to spread as 122 countries in six weeks, however past pandemics had spread in six months [13]. H1N1 pandemic profile had a course with three waves in spring, summer, and fall. The pattern was generally mild wave in the spring and early summer, but reemerged more severe after opening the schools. Studies showed that adults older than 50 years of age were less susceptible to 2009 H1N1 infection than younger adults.

Serial interval estimates are provided data in spreads speed to inform recommendations on the period that patients should stay home, and to estimate the effect in treatment on transmission [15]. The R0 for 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) has been estimated to be between 1.4 and 1.6 [16]. Secondary attack rates in pandemic showed significant variation, i.e. estimates of 33% in children and for adults 22% in different regions. Case fatality rates were obtained from high-income countries and varied three to nine times among the studies. According to one study, people younger than 64 years accounted for 80% of these deaths. Southeast Asia and Africa had highest mortality among of the other continent [17]. After three influenza pandemics in 20thcentury, it is expected when the first pandemic will be seen in 21st century. Humankind did not encounter a new influenza pandemics but a novel corona virus pandemic (Figure). As in pandemics in history, its spread to all over the world through people traveling between countries in two-three months. In the past, pandemics spread somewhat predictably along military passages or important trade routes, but globalization has multiplied and obscured the dominant routes. Given their sheer number, and the speed with which human and animal transmission vectors can move, there is no longer a single dominant pathway for the geographical movement and expansion of infectious diseases. Pandemics are inherently uncertain, considering experiences and preparations that we have gained from past pandemics, the epidemiologic characteristics of pandemic should be evaluated. By the way the impact of the control measures are be able to evaluate during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s days.",
