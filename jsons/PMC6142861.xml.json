            "text": "Enteric diseases are a big problem for animal health as well as in the poultry industry. Infected birds are affected from the first day of birth showing early clinical signs of enteric diseases, principally diarrhea; however, chickens of different ages are also affected, whether or not they are showing clinical signs (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007; Smyth et al., 2009; Todd et al., 2010; Mettifogo et al., 2014; Veen et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2017; De la Torre et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2018). In poultry, runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) is of great relevance to avian intestinal health, and many viruses are involved (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008; Day et al., 2015; Smyth, 2017). The syndrome is also known as infectious stunting syndrome, pale-bird syndrome, malabsorption syndrome, malassimilation, and helicopter disease (Goodwin et al., 1993; Kang et al., 2012, 2018; Bulbule et al., 2013; Day and Zsak, 2013; Nu\u00f1ez and Ferreira, 2013; Smyth, 2017), and was first described by Olsen (1977). The syndrome is characterized in animals by dwarfism, poor development, diarrhea, and mortality (Kang et al., 2012, 2018; Day and Zsak, 2013; Zsak et al., 2013; Domaska-Blicharz et al., 2017). Chicken parvovirus (ChPV), avian rotavirus (ARTv-A), avian reovirus (AReo), chicken astrovirus (CAstV), and avian nephritis virus (ANV) have been detected in the enteric contents of chickens showing enteric diseases (Goodwin et al., 1993; Otto et al., 2006; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007, 2011; Nu\u00f1ez and Ferreira, 2013; Mettifogo et al., 2014). ANV was reported and isolated for the first time by Yamaguchi et al. (1977) and is genetically related with the family Astroviridae, and classified as an astrovirus (Imada et al., 2000). ANV was associated with growth suppression, kidney lesions, and mortality in young chickens (Yamaguchi et al., 1977; Imada et al., 1979; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008). ANV was known to be reported in many countries around the world, including Japan, the United States, Australia, India, and South America, although mainly reported only in Brazil (Mettifogo et al., 2014). ANV has been associated with many symptoms beyond kidney injuries, with enteric problems appearing in naturally and experimentally infected animals. These animals experience apathy, weight loss, ruffled feathers, and mortality (Pantin-jackwood et al., 2008; Todd et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2012). ANV is a single-stranded RNA virus with a genome composed of 3 open reading frames (ORFs). ORF 1a is located close to the 5\u0384 terminus of the genome and encodes the viral protease. ORF 1a is followed by ORF 1b that encodes an RNA polymerase (Imada et al., 2000). ORF 2 encodes the capsid protein precursors and is located after ORF 1b and before the 3\u0384 untranslated region (UTR) (Imada et al., 2000; Todd et al., 2011). ORF 1b is a very conserved gene in ANV genome and is widely used for molecular amplification for diagnosis of ANV (Day et al., 2007; Chu et al., 2008). This polyprotein together with ORF 1a is cleaved into the non-structural proteins required for transcription and viral replication (Marvin, 2017). The sequencing of ORF 1b gene is not used for astrovirus genotyping where the capsid gene (ORF2) is used (Todd et al., 2011; Smyth et al., 2017; Luna et al., 2016), but could show similarities or differences between sequences from different serotypes of ANV. Recently, the presence of ANV in chickens, layer hens, and breeders showing signs of enteric diseases was reported in Brazil (Nu\u00f1ez and Ferreira, 2013; Mettifogo et al., 2014; Luna et al., 2016; De la Torre et al., 2018), and many outbreaks of enteric diseases have also been observed (unpublished data). The role of ANV in enteric disease in Brazilian chicken flocks is not well understood, and because there is a lack of viral isolates, it is difficult to study this virus.",

The sequences obtained in the present work were compared with the sequences from the ANV-1 serotype previously classified group and shared high similarity of NT and AA with sequences from Australia, Japan, China, and United States (Table 3).

The molecular analyses showed that the samples isolated from SPF-CEEs have more similarity with sequences of the ANV-1 serotype group, suggesting that the isolates share high similarity to this group. The phylogenetic tree showed 2 well-defined groups: one group (clade bootstrap value = 100%) that clustered the sequences previously serotyped as ANV-1 group and the second group (clade bootstrap value = 100%) that grouped the sequences previously serotyped as ANV-2. The sequences from the isolates obtained in this work were aligned with ANV-1 serotype group, clustered with the sequence from Japan. The sequences from China, the United States, and Australia were also grouped in the ANV-1 group, and the sequences from Germany and the United Kingdom were grouped in the ANV-2 serotype group (Figure 2). The present results show that the isolated ANV strains in this study share high similarity of NT and AA with the sequences of strain previously serotyped as ANV-1.",

These samples showed pathological features caused by the virus in the embryo. The studied virus isolated in 7- and 14-day-old SPF-CEE confirmed to be infected based on the presence of pathological alterations in the embryos, detection of viral RNA, and visualization of viral particles. Viral isolation in SPF-CEE is an old technique that has been used for several years to propagate and isolate viral agents to permit the study of their pathogenicity and virus behavior or to make vaccines oriented to protect the chickens against diseases (Guy, 2008; Alemnesh et al., 2012; Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015). Several viruses have been isolated in SPF-CEE either using primary cultures cells from many organs or using cell lines, where some viruses grow better than in eggs or primary cultures (McNulty et al., 1979; Baxendale and Mebatsion, 2004). Astrovirus of chicken origin, CAstV, and ANV grew well in the Leghorn Male Hepatoma (LMH) cell line, showing cytopathic effect with plaque formation after 6 d of inoculation (Baxendale and Mebatsion, 2004). ANV was cultivated and propagated in 11-day-old SPF-CEE onto the chorioallantoic membrane (Imada et al., 1979), and CAstV was isolated in 7- and 14-day-old SPF-CEE using the yolk sac route (Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015). The isolation of ANV in SPF-CEE using the yolk sac route is another alternative for replication as described in this study. These results are consistent with previous studies in which ANV was isolated using 7-day-old eggs (Imada et al., 1979), but isolation using 14-day-old eggs is not described.",

It was characterized as an astrovirus using genetic characterization and analysis of its complete genome, which classified it as a new avian astrovirus (Imada et al., 2000). Actually, ANV has been reported around the world and has been detected in many countries and on all continents. In recent years, ANV was detected in Brazil in chickens and turkeys showing signs of enteric diseases, principally signs of RSS (Hewson et al., 2010; Mettifogo et al., 2014; Moura-Alvarez et al., 2014; Luna et al., 2016; De la Torre et al., 2018). The implication or relation of this virus in RSS pathogeneses is not well clear. Here, ANV was isolated from enteric content samples from chickens showing RSS in the SPF-CEE, results that would help in understanding the behavior of the virus.",

This presents a bigger challenge in the case of viral isolation from RSS because several viruses are involved with this syndrome and these viruses are shed through the feces (Day et al., 2007; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007; Oluwayelu et al., 2012; Day and Zsak, 2013; Bennett and Gunson, 2017; Veen et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2018). In this study, the isolation of ANV was possible from the starting enteric content samples where the 7-day-old embryos show pathological alterations, such as hemorrhage, edema, and dwarfism when inoculated. Other studies when CAstV was isolated from the enteric contents also reported the presence of embryos and with alterations, such as hemorrhage and dwarfism (Bulbule et al., 2013; Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015), but mortality was not reported in these studies. ANV, as the name indicates, is a virus that is commonly associated with nephritis and injuries in the kidneys. The ANV isolated here in 14-day-old SPF-CEE did not show any macroscopic alteration of the kidneys, neither in the other organs of the embryo. Due to a possible presence of a low viral concentration, only 3 passages were carried out in this study, and the virus present in the kidneys was not quantified as well as no histopathological analyses were carried out to determine microscopical alteration in the kidneys.",

            "text": "ANV inoculated in 1-day-old SPF chickens produced dwarfism, enteric alterations, diarrhea, and a mild yellowish-tan discoloration in kidneys. From day 3 to 21, the virus was also detected in the bursa, jejunum, and spleen, but no alterations were found (Imada et al., 1979, 1981; Shirai et al., 1991), showing that the target organ of this virus is kidneys, but it could be present in other organs, such as gut. Actually, ANV is related to one of the principal causative agents of enteric problems, more specifically those related with RSS (Kang et al., 2012; Day and Zsak, 2013; Mettifogo et al., 2014; Day et al., 2015; Smyth, 2017; De la Torre et al., 2018). The samples used here were from chickens showing signs of enteric diseases that were positive only for ANV after molecular screening, suggesting that the principal agent is involved in the genesis of some enteric problems may be ANV. During the last decade, several outbreaks of RSS were reported in commercial chicken flocks in several states of Brazil (unpublished data), but the presence of ANV in Brazilian poultry was reported previously in chickens (Mettifogo et al., 2014) showing that the virus is present in the 45% of samples analyzed alone or in combination with other viruses. ANV was also reported in 56% of turkeys (Moura-Alvarez et al., 2013). These results showed the importance of ANV in the enteric problems, and how important is the study and isolation of the ANV that is circulating in Brazilian chicken flocks as it would help in the understanding of the virus behavior and would bring more information about its pathogenicity.",

However, their role in enteric diseases is not well understood; however, chickens inoculated orally with ANV produce dwarfism and diarrhea (Kang et al., 2012; Day and Zsak, 2013; Smyth, 2017). The study of enteric diseases or, more specifically, RSS is a big challenge because some viral agents are involved in their pathogenesis. The application of the next generation nucleic acid sequencing and metagenomics studies of the viral population in the intestinal contents of chickens with RSS shows the presence of other viruses beyond the commonly reported virus, such as picobirnaviruses and caliciviruses (Day and Zsak, 2013; Day et al., 2015; Smyth, 2017). This shows the viral diversity and possible viral combinations that could be in the chicken gut, which complicates the study of enteric diseases and syndromes. However, there are studies showing that when a virus is inoculated alone, it produces RSS (Kang et al., 2012, 2018; Zsak et al., 2013). ANV inoculated alone could cause enteric problems (Kang et al., 2012) and could be considered a causative agent of enteric disease, principally a causative agent of RSS. As mentioned before, the strains of ANV isolated in the present work were from chickens with signs of RSS. For these reasons, the implication of ANV in Brazilian chicken flocks as a causative agent of RSS is something that needs to be investigated to determine if this isolate could cause RSS.",

Today, many molecular assays for the identification of ANV have been developed and used as diagnostic tools (Day et al., 2007; Smyth et al., 2010; Todd et al., 2010). In the present investigation, 2 assays were used to determine the presence of ANV in the SPF-CEE. Moreover, they provide information about the virus genome and virus epidemiology. Therefore, before the emergence of molecular techniques, other assays, such as electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and ELISA, were also used for ANV detection (Imada et al., 1981; Decaesstecker and Meulemans, 1991; Woolcock and Shivaprasad, 2008). As was shown in this study, viral particles were observed in the supernatant from samples where ANV was isolated, confirming the presence of the virus in the embryo, but it was not determined which part of the embryo or which organ is more susceptible to ANV. For this reason, more studies are needed to determine where the virus replicates better and determine which organ is the target in the SPF-CEE.",

Actually, 2 serological groups of ANV, ANV-1 and ANV-2, are recognized. However, molecular studies involving an ORF2 gene that encodes a structural capsid protein showed the presence of 6 genetic like groups, ANV-1 to ANV-6 (Todd et al., 2011). Officially, there are 3 different astrovirus species that comprises the Avastrovirus genus (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses-ICTV) and the genotypic classification by Astroviridae Study Group proposed 7 avastrovirus genotypes (AAstV-1 to AAstV-7) based on ORF 2 analyses. ANV belongings principally to AAstV-2 and other ANV strains have been detected and isolated from wild and domestic pigeons and were classified in the genotypes 5, 6, and 7. Recently, 2 novel genotypes 8 and 9 were proposed (Luna et al., 2016). This genetic characterization shows the diversity of this virus and how the strains are distributed around the world. The results presented here suggest that the ANV isolates in SPF-CEE are more related with the sequences of ANV-1 serotype previously classified. However, more studies need to be carried out to characterize the viral capsid (ORF 2 gene) of Brazilian\u00b4s isolates shown in the present investigation. The study of the capsid protein genes is important for the understanding of the Astroviridae family, but the difficulty in isolating and propagating astroviruses has limited their molecular characterization (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011). In the present work, the difficulty of isolation resulted in only 8 samples from 22 where the isolation of ANV was possible. This lack of viral isolation, as showed here only 3 passages were carried out, is due to many factors such as the low viral concentration in the samples producing blind passages until third passage, viral inactivation is another condition due to management of samples transported to laboratory under weak conditions of temperature, storage conditions before thawing, and freezing the sample before testing, or inoculum preparation in which viral particles are damaged and preclude the replication and propagation. Moreover, more number of samples isolated in eggs of 7 d of age (6 samples) than in eggs of 14 days of age where only 2 samples were shown. This condition could be explained by the fact that in eggs with 7 days of incubation, the yolk is easier to access, but not so in eggs with more days of incubation where the size of the embryo makes it more difficult to reach the yolk and deposit the inoculum.",

To our knowledge, this is the first report of ANV isolation in SPF-CEE from chickens showing signs of RSS in Brazil.",
