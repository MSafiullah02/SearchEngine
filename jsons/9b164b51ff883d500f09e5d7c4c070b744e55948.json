The viruses can be classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and deltaCoVs (Woo et al., 2009 ; https://talk.ictvonline.org/). Previously identified human CoVs that cause human disease include the alphaCoVs hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E and the betaCoVs HCoV-OC43, HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (Lu et al., 2015; Wevers and van der Hoek, 2009 ). Both alphaCoVs and the betaCoVs HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 cause self-limiting common cold-like illnesses (Chiu et al., 2005; Gorse et al., 2009; Jean et al., 2013; Jev snik et al., 2012) .

Consistent with this high degree of similarity, the soluble SARS-RBD blocks the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 ligand with hACE2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures S2J and S2K) . Further detailed comparison of the receptor binding interface between the two viruses reveals that, among the 24 residues in hACE2 that make vdw contacts with either CTD, 15 amino acids display more contacts with the SARS-CoV-2-CTD ( Table 2 ). The SARS-CoV-2-CTD binding interface also has more residues than SARS-RBD (21 versus 17) that directly interact with hACE2, forming more vdw contacts (288 versus 213) as well as H-bonds (16 versus 11) (Tables 2 and S1).

To test this hypothesis, we performed real-time surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays.
