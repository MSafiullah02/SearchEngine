A total of 238 were infected with SARS, of whom 33 died. All survivors of probable SARS in Singapore aged 21 years and above were eligible. Those with pre\u2010existing endocrine disorders before SARS were excluded. Out of 205 survivors, two with underlying primary hypothyroidism were excluded, and 61 who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and provided written informed consent were prospectively enrolled about 3 months postdischarge, with the last batch of patients entered into the study by 30 September 2003 and followed up till 1 October 2004. Most of the remaining survivors not recruited did not consent for a variety of personal reasons, many of whom cited inconvenience, inability to be followed up over an extended period of 1 year or their reluctance to be subjected to laboratory investigations. A number of survivors refused to participate on grounds of being psychologically unprepared, or being in a state of grief over their deceased relatives who expired from SARS. Some remained noncontactable and could not be recruited and several were underaged individuals excluded for the purpose of this study. Using admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) as an arbitrary criterion for severe SARS, 46 were severe SARS cases admitted to the ICU of whom 20 survived; among them, eight severe SARS subjects were enrolled while 12 declined participation. Thus, among the survivors with severe SARS, 13\u00b71% (8/61) were recruited while 8\u00b73% (12/144) were not recruited. As such, more subjects with severe SARS were represented in the study cohort than those who were not entered into the study.",

Twenty\u2010four (39\u00b73%) patients had hypocortisolism, of which 20 (83\u00b73%) had unequivocal central hypocortisolism as evidenced by concomitant low or inappropriately normal ACTH levels (Table 2). Four (16\u00b77%) had hypocortisolism associated with plasma ACTH above the upper reference limit of 11 pmol/l (50 pg/ml). Although this may superficially suggest primary hypocortisolism, the levels of ACTH were not elevated sufficiently to be diagnostic of primary hypocortisolism. In the absence of renin\u2013aldosterone data and overt addisonian crisis, primary adrenal insufficiency was most unlikely, whereas secondary hypocortisolism appear to be the main form of HPA axis dysfunction encountered here. Indeed, the raised ACTH may in fact be a reflection of a recovering HPA axis following steroid\u2010induced suppression. Among these four patients, one who was given systemic steroids during SARS was probably a case of central hypocortisolism rather than primary hypocortisolism, being recruited at a time when the hypothalamo\u2010pituitary unit was recovering from transient HPA axis suppression, while the other three with elevated ACTH who had no steroids exposure during SARS or prior to SARS could arguably be cases of SARS\u2010induced central hypocortisolism showing evidence of early hypothalamo\u2010pituitary recovery rather than primary adrenal insufficiency.",

Because the treatment protocol for critically ill SARS patients managed in the ICU included the use of high\u2010dose systemic glucocorticoids, HPA axis suppression as a cause of central hypocortisolism from exogenous steroid exposure remains a possibility. Of the 24 patients with hypocortisolism, six received systemic glucocorticoids during SARS while one was an asthmatic on inhaled corticosteroids. Among the six patients treated with systemic glucocorticoids, three were on prednisolone up to a dose of 60 mg given for 2\u20135 days; the other three patients had intravenous methylprednisolone 200 mg for 3 days, followed by hydrocortisone 100 mg 8 hourly for about a week before being switched to oral prednisolone tapered over 10 days. Notably, the majority (18 patients) of those with hypocortisolism were glucocorticoid na\u00efve. Four of six patients treated with high\u2010dose parenteral glucocorticoids who escaped hypocortisolism post\u2010SARS demonstrated the lack of prolonged suppression on the HPA axis with the corticosteroid regimen and doses utilized.",

As a corroborative measure, to determine if hypocortisolism occurred during acute SARS in those steroid\u2010na\u00efve patients without SST data, retrospective data of blood pressures recorded at the height of the febrile period were compared against that during apyrexial phase at discharge. This assumes that any patient with acute hypocortisolism developing in the midst of SARS would manifest profound hypotension. However, the average decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) was modest and comparable between the group who had hypocortisolism post\u2010SARS (\u22129\u00b78 mmHg, n = 15) and those who remained eucortisolic (\u221210\u00b74 mmHg, n = 17).",

Other than mild reduction in MAP during pyrexia from SARS, the absence of overt hypotension during the acute febrile phase of SARS in survivors who developed hypocortisolism subsequently also suggests that SARS\u2010associated hypocortisolism is a late\u2010onset phenomenon.

This finding may be explained by the fact that adrenal androgen production is not solely regulated by ACTH, but also by extra\u2010adrenal peptides including \u03b2\u2010endorphin and \u03b2\u2010lipotropin, and by an intra\u2010adrenal neuroimmune system.\n22\n, \n23\n It is possible that DHEA replacement could further ameliorate symptoms in those with DHEAS deficiency. Because of the dramatic improvement of energy level, mood and resolution of dizziness after achieving satisfactory cortisol levels, DHEA replacement was not instituted in those affected, predominantly female patients in case adverse effects outweigh its benefits. We elected not to investigate the rest of the pituitary hormones and only to focus our attention on the HPA axis and thyroid dysfunction which were better defined in postviral syndromes.",
