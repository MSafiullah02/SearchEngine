The information about the emergence of a new pandemic strain can be obtained immediately, and thus the anti-influenza measures implemented at the national level (Bednarska et al. 2016).",

The risks groups included adults above 65 years of age and all persons over 6 months of age with chronic diseases (ECDC 2017). However, this goal has not been achieved in most of the countries (Weimbergen 2018). The vaccination rate in the 2017/18 epidemic season in the population of Poland amounted to 3.4%. Such a dismal vaccination rate places the country in the last place in Europe (Brydak 2019). Further, seasonal epidemics occur in Poland every year, causing a large number of deaths and post-influenza morbidity, incurring huge socioeconomic costs (Brydak 2018). The epidemics cannot be properly countered without a proper population vaccination rate, the main preventive measure against influenza. This study seeks to define the dynamics of influenza infections and the prevalence of dominant viral types in Poland during the 2017/18 epidemic season, based on the data tallied by the SENTINEL influenza surveillance program.",

From a 200 \u03bcl clinical sample suspended in physiological saline, 50 \u03bcl of viral RNA resuspended in RNase-free water was obtained. For the assay, a Maxwell 16 Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit was used (Promega Corporation; Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The analytes were further analyzed to determine viral subtypes using a Light Thermocycler 2.0 System (Roche Diagnostics; Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The primers and probes were obtained from the International Reagent Resource run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The reaction was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. To obtain cDNA, RNA was subjected to reverse transcription (at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min). Then, cDNA was subjected to the initiating process (1 cycle of 95 \u00b0C for 2 min) followed by 45 cycles of amplification: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 10 s, and elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 20 s. Positive control constituted viral RNA obtained from the vaccine strains for the current epidemic season (A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09, A/HongKong/4801/2014 (H3N2), B/Brisbane/60/2008), and negative control constituted RNase-free water.",

Data from this system are key to determine the dynamics of season infections and to announce the epidemic by the relevant authorities in the country (Cie\u015blak et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2018). Comparing the increasing number of confirmed cases of influenza in the 2017/18 epidemic season in Poland with other European countries, we notice almost the same situation. In Germany, single positive samples have been recorded since the season\u2019s beginning, i.e., Week 40 of 2017. The highest number of cases and the highest percentage of positive samples (over 60%) were recorded there in Week 9, which closely corresponds to the Polish data. In Czech Republic, the threshold of over 60% of positive specimens was achieved already in Week 5 and lasted until Week 9. Further, the dominance of influenza type B has been reported there, similarly to the epidemiological situation in Poland. Concerning influenza type A, subtype A/H1N1/pdm09 has also dominated (FluNews Europe 2018). This trend has been different from that in the 2016/17 season, when the subtype A/H3N2/dominated, while the A/H1N1/pdm09 was not recorded (Cie\u015blak et al. 2018). The first positive specimens in Poland were recorded in Week 48, which distinguishes the current season from the previous one. The 2016/17 season started earlier, because the threshold of 10% of positive tests has already been exceeded from Week 46 onward (Adlhoch et al. 2018).",
