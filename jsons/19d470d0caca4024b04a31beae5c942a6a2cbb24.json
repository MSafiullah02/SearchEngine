Unfortunately, most patients do not have access to their complete health information as they are stored across the various institutions that they have visited over their lifetime. The purpose of this paper is to report on an investigation into developing a mobile system for patient-centered healthcare using blockchain technology. A design science research approach was used to design, develop and evaluate a prototype that implemented a three-tier architecture using blockchain. Formative evaluations of the prototype revealed that the system could successfully support patient-managed healthcare. The implications of this project would be changing the way patients and healthcare practitioners interact with each other by improving the quality of clinical encounters by allowing patients access to their health information, sharing the information with healthcare practitioners and both parties collaborating in the development of a treatment plan.",

            "text": "South Africa plans on implementing the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme to provide cost effective access to healthcare for all citizens. Once the scheme is in place, it is believed that the focus of the healthcare industry will shift towards preventative care and health promotion. This would require the industry to become patient-centred. Paper-based filing has major risks such as being vulnerable to damage by elements such as fire and water and medical records being lost [7] . In addition, backups are time and resource intensive and security of paper-based filing is limited to locked storage, with minimal capabilities of logging access to medical records. Various types of electronic records exist, each having a different purpose [13] . For example, an electronic medical record (EMR) typically contains detailed patient encounter information such as an encounter summary, medical history, test results, and allergy details. EMRs are owned and managed by professionals from a single institution. An electronic health record (EHR) is an aggregated collection of a patient's health information collected from multiple professionals at multiple institutions [19] . It ensures that a patient's complete medical record is available to an authorised practitioner during patient encounters. No country in Africa has been successful in implementing a nationwide EHR system [21] . EHR and EMR are used interchangeably in the literature but the term EHR is used to refer to all electronic records for health information in this study.",

The security of paper-based filing is limited to locked storage, with minimal capabilities of logging access to medical records. A major issue with paper-based filing is illegibility. Illegibility causes delays in treating patients as time is wasted by trying to understand what is written, contacting the author or redoing the procedure to reproduce the results. The problems associated with paperbased filing are solved with electronic records. Electronic records such as EHR use secure information systems to store and access patient health information and to ensure that the information contained is up-to-date and available when needed [13] .",

Despite these challenges, various vendors in SA have attempted to implement their own EHR systems, built on differing architecture which fail to interoperate with each other [21] . Disinterest stems from the belief that measurable benefits (such as finances) are better realised within their own organisation. Thus, to gain the benefits of an EHR system, patients are limited to clinical encounters with organisations that utilise the specific EHR system. This devalues the effectiveness and efficiency of patients managing their own healthcare. The biggest challenge preventing the adoption of EHR systems in the health industry is the resistance from practitioners [22] .",

It was indicated by 51% of respondents that time was wasted when having to recount their medical history to all the practitioners that they visited. Surprisingly, those with medical aid are willing to spend up to R100 extra per month to have their health records maintained electronically [13] . Muchangi and Nzuki [24] revealed that patients are not confident in using EMR systems that do not comply with established standards as they fear that their medical confidentiality and security might be compromised. Currently, the SA government lacks legislation and regulations regarding EMR implementation which has led to misuse and poor compliance by organisations [21] . Until the government develops standards for EMR, common guidelines must be followed in developing such systems.",

Distributed systems divide computations into smaller computations to be performed by multiple nodes. Distributed and decentralised systems are highly secure as a central point to attack is lacking. This feature also makes them stable and fault-tolerant. Since each node has equal authority, unethical operations are unlikely to be performed [16] .

OHCs unite individuals with a shared goal or interest in healthcare. OHCs comprise of patients with a condition (such as ALS patients), a group of practitioners with a shared medical interest (such as neurologists), or a mixture of both. OHC members interact using modern communication technologies such as blogs, chats, forums, and wikis. OHCs can be classified into open and closed communities. Open OHCs are public and its contents can be accessed by anyone. All members of the community can contribute to its content.",

AidIT was the only system identified that provides data storage and access and is a mobile EMR system that allows patients to manage their records and facilitates the exchange of these records between patients and practitioners [8] . The AidIT system provides patients with a personal health folder that organises a patient's data into five separate categories namely: the patient's personal information (e.g. address, date of birth, photograph and information regarding his/her insurance profile); the patient's general medical history (e.g. past injuries, chronic conditions, allergies and healthcare encounters); the patient's past examinations and relevant diagnoses along with ordered lab tests and their results; the patient's current and past medication prescriptions, along with the quantity and dosage instructions required for each medication; and the patient's care plan. The patient's care plan is designed by the patient's practitioners as a list of actions to be carried out by the patient. AidT's shortcomings includes non-functionality for tracking and monitoring a patient's adherence to their medication schedule. In addition, EMR presentation does not indicate what is important and professionals can amend prior medical records which can create inconsistencies.",

A walkthrough evaluation was conducted on both wireframes by an expert reviewer as proposed by [1] . AdobeXD was chosen to prototype the two alternative designs as the software is a free, simple to use platform that allows for designing high fidelity wireframes that can be interacted with to simulate the system's usage. The feedback received indicated that the first wireframe was too cluttered while the second wireframe had a professional feel and made better use of hand gestures for navigation. The second wireframe design was therefore selected for further development and sample screenshots are shown in Fig. 2 . A second walkthrough of the second wireframe was undertaken by a second expert reviewer. The primary feedback received was to limit the viewing of the professionals' information to only those that have been referred to by one of the professionals in their community.

The updated system after these changes were made and the benefits are for registering and creating a new medical record while smart lock is for registration and login. The third iteration occurred during the implementation of the blockchain related aspects. Notifying users of important events (include invites to a community; receiving messages and medication schedules, being informed of non-adherence to medication) were a problem. The solidity development environment supported functionality for logging events, such as medication adherence and invites, which play an integral part of the notification functionality; not all blockchain networks support this functionality (logging events). The workaround to this was to restrict the medication schedule to a patients' native calendar; thus, removing the functionality of viewing a patient's adherence to the medication schedule. A second solution workaround is using the QR codes which was embedded with the smart contract's details and used to send invites to a patient's PHC. The QR codes could also be used to save a user's blockchain credentials for when they first register on the systems database.",
