The major stakeholders include pharmaceutical companies, production integrators, feed suppliers, farm groups, producers, restaurants, food retailers, the public, the medical community, the scientific community, government regulators and policy makers. Each of these stakeholders faces a different set of incentives and disincentives related to on-farm use of antibiotics in animal agriculture. Knowledge of these incentives and disincentives has evolved with the accumulation of scientific and economic research. To understand the regulatory outcomes governing antibiotic use in agriculture, it is important to recognize the political economy context in which they are developed. The various stakeholders are driven by the relative benefits they receive under policies as they affect their industry segment (Zilberman et al. 2014 ).",

If preventative measures are not taken and a disease outbreak occurs and spreads rapidly within a flock or herd, it risks large numbers of animals developing a deadly, high mortality disease. Waiting until a disease is clearly evident makes successfully treating the active infections very difficult due to the large number of animals involved. By contrast, a human patient can generally be quickly diagnosed and treated. While some are concerned that producers will continue to use antibiotics for growth under the guise of prevention, the FDA-approved label is specific about dose and duration for a specified bacterium or disease. Off-label use of antibiotics in animal production is illegal, and FDA only allows a veterinarian to decide whether to use or not to use a preventative treatment based on their judgment of a disease threat (Carnevale 2016) .",

It noted a dramatic increase in numbers of animal-origin bacteria strains which showed resistance to one or more antibiotics and that these strains could transmit resistance to other bacteria. It recommended that only antimicrobials that are not medically important for humans should be used without prescription in animal feed and that antimicrobials should only be used for therapeutic purposes under veterinary supervision.

In 1984, the FDA funded the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health to analyze Salmonella and Campylobacter, which were chosen as models to estimate the flow of potentially pathogenic bacteria from animals to humans through the food chain. Their report was based on sampling retail meat and poultry and investigating Salmonella and Campylobacter enteritis cases in humans. Isolates from human illness cases and retail foods were analyzed for antibiotic resistance of these pathogens, using plasmid analysis and serotyping. The report found that Campylobacter was a more common cause of enteritis than Salmonella and appeared to flow from chickens to humans through consumption of poultry products, with tetracycline resistance being plasmid-mediated (Seattle-King County Department of Public Health 1984). 3. In 1988, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) undertook a FDA-requested independent quantitative risk assessment of human health impacts from sub-therapeutic use of penicillin and tetracycline in animal feed. Based on a risk-analysis model of Salmonella infections that resulted in human death, the IOM did not find substantial direct evidence that sub-therapeutic use in animal feed posed a human health hazard. However, they found a considerable body of indirect evidence implicating both sub-therapeutic and therapeutic use of antimicrobials as a potential health hazard and strongly recommended additional study of the issue (Institute of Medicine 1988).",

In most cases, antibiotic resistant infections require prolonged and/or costlier treatments, extend hospital stays, necessitate additional doctor visits and healthcare use, and result in greater disability and death compared with infections that are easily treatable with antibiotics. The total economic costs of antibiotic resistance to the U.S. economy has been difficult to calculate. Estimates vary but have ranged as high as $20 billion in excess direct healthcare costs. Adding on the costs for lost productivity brings the total societal costs (sic) for AR to $35 billion a year (2008 dollars). (CDC 2013a, p. 11) This CDC report also indicates that foodborne cases are responsible for 20% of human AR infections ( Fig. 15 .1). Thus, societal costs of these AR foodborne illnesses could total $7 billion annually of the $35 billion/year total costs to the US economy. These societal costs could be prevented if the foods were free of contamination with AR pathogens. There may be additional costs associated with environmental pathways of human contamination from use of antibiotics in meat production, such as exposure to contaminated water. In 2014, WHO stated: \"Antimicrobial resistance (AR) is an increasingly serious threat to global public health. AR develops when a microorganism (bacteria, fungus, virus or parasite) no longer responds to a drug to which it was originally sensitive. This means that standard treatments no longer work; infections are harder or impossible to control; the risk of the spread of infection to others is increased; illness and hospital stays are prolonged, with added economic and social costs; and the risk of death is greater-in some cases, twice that of patients who have infections caused by non-resistant bacteria. The problem is so serious that it threatens the achievements of modern medicine. A post-antibiotic era-in which common infections and minor injuries can kill-is a very real possibility for the 21st century\" (WHO 2014, p. 3) .",

ARMS is a nationally representative survey of farms administered jointly by ERS and USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Hog producers were surveyed in 2006 and 2009, and broiler producers were surveyed in 2006 and 2011. ERS also drew upon their research using data in the National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) to develop a model to estimate the impacts of withdrawing antibiotics for other than therapeutic use in food animals. Using Monte Carlo simulations, ERS estimated the impacts of eliminating antibiotic use for growth promotion of poultry and pork, not just the FDA-specified \"medically important\" antibiotics (Table 15 .1). Simulation results showed less than 0.5% reduction in output and an approximate 0.75% increase in wholesale prices, netting pork producers greater total revenue of 0.29% and poultry producers 0.42%. ERS concluded that these small effects were not statistically significant (Sneeringer et al. 2015) . These ERS results are consistent with research studies post-2000 indicating that productivity gains from using antibiotics for growth promotion were lower than earlier research had found (Teillant and Laxminarayan 2015) . Another report suggested that phase out of growth promotion use in food animals over a 5-year period would avoid most of the 67% projected global growth in such use and cost agricultural sectors a small portion of the costs of AR in each country. Further, reduced infection risk and costs of medications would cover most farm-level costs of improving animal husbandry practices to offset loss of antimicrobials for production purposes (Laxminarayan and Chaudhury 2016) .",

The threat of superbugs via food is worldwide, due to the distribution of animal food products from China (Zhang et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2013) . Rosenblatt-Farrell (2009) drew upon existing literature to identify additional environmental paths to exposure to antibiotic resistance. Veterinary antibiotics are frequently excreted intact from food animals (Table 15 .2). For the widely used tetracycline, 60-80% of the antibiotic is excreted in the feces or urine and not metabolized by the food animal. The transfer of this animal waste to croplands may transfer antibiotics and possibly AR pathogens. In one study, AR genes in soil increased fourfold after manure from hog and dairy farms was applied to the soil (Moyer 2016) . Runoff from farms, feedlots, or cropland can lead to antimicrobial resistance problems in soil, surface water runoff, and groundwater. Animal waste held in lagoons allows birds and insects to become contaminated with antibioticresistant bacteria, and flies around food animal facilities can carry antibioticresistant enteric bacteria which increases potential human exposure. Migratory birds and seagulls which become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria or viruses can widely transmit resistance to other birds as well as marine life.",

After industry opposition and Congressional intervention to require further study, this early policy response was withdrawn. Subsequently, the US Congress gave something to each group when it enacted the Animal Drug Availability Act (ADAA) in 1996. This Act both Table 15 .3, FDA in recent years issued three core documents to implement a policy framework for judicious use of medically important antimicrobial drugs in food animals: On January 3, 2017, FDA announced that it had completed implementation of the Guidance for Industry #213. This means that medically important antimicrobials provided to food-producing animals may no longer be used for growth promotion purposes and may be used to treat, prevent, or control animal illnesses only under direction of a veterinarian. FDA worked with industry participants to implement this voluntary compliance to slow development of antimicrobial resistance and preserve effectiveness of medically important antibiotics. More than 70 percent of 292 new drug applications subject to GFI #213 were converted from over-the-counter to prescription status, 84 applications were withdrawn, and all 31 applications indicating production use withdrew that specified use. FDA also indicated plans to work with industry stakeholders to support antimicrobial stewardship in food animal production and to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies to reduce antimicrobial resistance development under the allowed uses (FDA 2017).",

At that time, USDA FSIS had not published a standard for such claims, nor was a clear definition established. Perdue and Tyson developed their own standards and submitted the label claims to FSIS for approval along with supporting documentation. After initially approving both firms' label claims, FSIS determined in September 2007 that Tyson's claim was false and misleading and gave them the opportunity to submit a revised label claim. However, Tyson continued their advertising of the RWA claims. The diverse label claims in which Tyson and their competitors were using different standards for their claim resulted in consumer confusion, and eventually court challenges were filed jointly by Sanderson Farms, the fourth largest producer, and Perdue against Tyson. The suit was upheld in court in April 2008. Tyson was found not to have delivered the RWA attribute promised to the marketplace and to thereby have harmed competitors, while Tyson profited from introducing a false and misleading claim. In June 2008, FSIS rescinded Tyson's qualified RWA label claim and required its removal within 2 weeks, after the claims and advertising had continued for more than a year. The authors found no evidence that the events had any impact on Tyson's brand, suggesting that companies may have incentives to introduce misleading label claims since the size of penalties is uncertain (Bowman et al. 2016) .",

Further, USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) process-verified and certification programs are very effective in helping to assure the credibility of voluntary labeling, while accommodating innovation from the private sector. GNP's adoption of antibiotics-free production discussed in 15.8 is an example of dynamic market efficiency through use of voluntary labeling to innovate in response to changing consumer demand USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) currently employs an animal production claims protocol for evaluating and allowing or denying labeling claims. Labeling applications must provide supporting documentation such as operational protocols detailing production practices and affidavits or testimonials about production practices. FSIS then evaluates whether protocols support the accuracy of the proposed label. Also, feed formulations must be provided and reviewed to ensure they do not include substances not permitted by the claim. Commonly approved claims relevant to the use of antibiotics include \"raised without added hormones\" (only allowed for use in beef cattle and lamb production) and \"raised without antibiotics.\" Claims not allowed include that animal products are antibiotic-, hormone-, or residue-\"free\" (FSIS 2016) . Given the current trend among meat producers, restaurants, and retail livestock product marketers, it can be anticipated that there will be increasing attention to labeling the lack of antibiotic use for other than therapeutic purposes. This will likely result in animals that have been raised with antibiotics to promote growth and uniformity of size consistent with processor contract agreements being diverted to marketing outlets where such promises do not exist. The impact of labeling in this manner will vary according to how much consumers know about the use of antibiotics in livestock production and their ability to currently purchase antibiotic-free livestock products (Lusk et al. 2006) .",

FDA (2016b) issued a final rule amending an existing requirement that sponsors of drug products containing antimicrobial active ingredients report annually the amount of each such ingredient in the drug products sold or distributed for use in food-producing animals. Effective July 11, 2016, drug sponsors were required to submit species-specific estimates of product sales as a percent of their total sales. Additional reporting requirements are expected to facilitate better understanding of antimicrobial drug sales for specific food-producing animal species and the relationship between such sales and antimicrobial resistance. As reported above, drug sponsors have all adopted voluntary revision of FDA-approved labels for use of new medically important antimicrobial animal drugs administered through feed or water. Under this rule, sponsors all voluntarily removed the growth promotion and feed efficiency uses and brought the remaining therapeutic uses under veterinarian oversight by the end of December 2016. The rule makes it illegal to use medically important antibiotics for production purposes. Despite the scientific and economic evidence, many comments to the proposed final regulation reflected ongoing resistance to the elimination of food animal production use of medically important antibiotics.",

The Agricultural and Resource Management Survey (ARMS) is designed to collect information on farm finances, production practices, and resource use focuses on three commodities annually, livestock included. Different types of livestock are resurveyed every 5-6 years and represent commercial producers in states producing 90% of production for that livestock type. Some questions have been included in these surveys on antibiotic use for hogs and broilers. The hog surveys ask about use of antibiotics in feed or water for growth promotion, disease preven-tion, and/or disease treatment in breeding, nursery, and finishing hogs. Given the widespread use of hog production contracts under which farm operators may receive feed from integrators, the surveyed operators may not know if antibiotics are included in it. For broilers, there is only a single question about whether they were raised without antibiotics in feed or water other than for therapeutic treatment of illness. Production contracts dominate the broiler industry, so surveyed farm operators are in a similar situation as hog producers in not necessarily knowing whether antibiotics are included in the feed provided. A further complication is that ARMS does not separate traditional antibiotics and ionophores, which are not used in human medicine (Sneeringer et al. 2015) .",

First, establish 10-year targets for reduction in use, with milestones to support progress consistent with countries' economic development. This could encourage farmers to reduce non-therapeutic use to be able to allocate the resulting reduced amounts of antibiotics to treating sick animals. Second, implement restrictions or bans on certain types of highly critical last-line antibiotics for humans from being used in agriculture. This would require a harmonized approach to identify the most important human health antimicrobials across countries and good systems of veterinarian oversight to assure compliance. Third, improve transparency from food producers on antibiotic use in meat production to allow consumers to make better informed buying decisions. Voluntary industry efforts may be one of the most practical approaches to reduce antibiotic use in the near term, but third-party validation to monitor progress would be beneficial (O'Neill 2016) . Generally, voluntary industry approaches require monitoring by an outside party to assure both industry participants and consumers that standards are being met as required.",

For example, the widely used tetracycline was introduced in 1950 and developed resistance to Shigella by 1959. This is near the midrange of years to resistance reported (CDC 2013a). Given this scientific fact, the slow pace of adopting policies to proscribe use of human-use antibiotics in animals and to encourage greater investment in developing newer antibiotics or alternatives is unacceptable. Increasing detection of bacteria resistant to last-resort drugs has driven stakeholders to countenance accelerating government efforts to increase surveillance of drug use and to develop new antibiotics (FDA Week 2016).

A project underway at the University of California, Davis, the 100 K Foodborne Pathogen Genome Sequencing Project, will sequence 100,000 foodborne isolates for the most important worldwide foodborne illness outbreak organisms. It involves a consortium of academic, government, and industry to create a massive database of genome signatures for the most significant foodborne disease-causing microbes. The goal is to allow public health agencies and the food industry supply chain to trace any foodborne illness outbreaks to their source. By comparing the pathogen genome to the database which includes millions of pieces of information on previously detected strains, including their exact location, the contamination source will be positively identified. Bioinformatics and the analytics involved can be used to turn the vast amount of genomic information into actionable knowledge. These event sequencing approaches will enable new diagnostic and public health approaches to manage foodborne disease to facilitate improved public health. The database will increase ability to detect and mitigate pathogenic organisms in food, the environment, and livestock. That capacity is now constrained by continual genetic evolution of pathogens which hinders the ability to defend the food supply. This project will facilitate speedy testing of raw ingredients and finished products from outbreak investigations with precision and accuracy unparalleled using existing methods of analysis. Genomics enabled diagnostics with molecular tools will allow surveillance, risk assessment, and diagnosis of foodborne pathogens directly throughout the global food chain. The result will be a genetic catalog for some of the most important outbreak organisms impacting human health. The database will provide insights into molecular methods of infection and drug resistance for use in creating new vaccines and therapies. And importantly, it will assist in systematic definition of biomarker gene sets associated with antibiotic resistance (Weimer 2016).",

Moreover, there is a need to educate producers-for example, through the USDA-State Cooperative Extension Service-about safe production practices for managing AR. This will allow producers to maintain efficiency in their operations and assure that they comply with current regulations to address the growing concern about antimicrobial resistance in the food supply chain. Improved data collection and analysis to allow tracking of potential antimicrobial resistance development are essential to facilitate the food animal industry implementation of cultural practices to reduce the potential for contributing to antimicrobial resistance. It would also allow policy makers to better understand the need for any necessary interventions. These investments in the public good can be very cost-effective, though not without additional public investment or internal agency budget reallocation.",

This scenario could be exacerbated to the extent FSIS approves additional international facilities, local regulations, and inspections as \"equivalent to the United States.\" In many developed and developing countries, antimicrobial agents are readily available.

Future trade agreements will need to include provisions which address reduced use of medically important antibiotics in producing food animals.",

Increased attention to this issue is emerging in the medical community where overuse of existing drugs and inadequate sanitary precautions account for 80% of the resistance. Lack of development of new antibiotics exacerbates the problem, and industry focus and perhaps government policy are needed to improve this situation. Animal agriculture stakeholders need to improve production practices to reverse the other 20% of resistance attributable to foodborne sources. Government policy and agencies have been slow to acknowledge the seriousness of antibiotic resistance and appropriately address it. Public and private sector collaboration internationally is necessary to successfully deal with this critical societal issue.",

When fully implemented, feed use of antimicrobial drugs would transition from over-the-counter (OTC) to VFD marketing status (Veterinary Feed Directive 2015). \u2022 The third element in this process is the VFD regulation issued in June 2015. The FDA amended regulations for Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) drugs used in animal feeds to improve the efficiency of the program but still protect human and animal health. VFD drugs are new animal drugs for use in feed, allowed only under professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian who issues an order (VFD) under a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR). The VFD rule is the final document to implement FDA's policy framework for judicious use of medically important antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals. It eliminates feed and water use of medically important antimicrobial drugs for production purposes. Remaining therapeutic uses of these drugs are brought under oversight of licensed veterinarians. The final rule provides accountability through important controls regarding distribution and use of VFD drugs. It facilitates transition of the currently large number of over-the-counter (OTC) feed-use antimicrobial drugs to a new VFD status (Veterinary Feed Directive 2015).",
