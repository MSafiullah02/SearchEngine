            "text": "Corticosteroids are the most used anti-inflammatory drugs and are involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including regulation of inflammation, immune response, carbohydrate metabolism, protein catabolism, and blood electrolyte levels. 11, 12 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids inhibit the expression and action of many inflammatory mediators. To exert their effects, corticosteroids need to bind to a specific cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) found in respiratory epithelial cells and other cell lines. The activation of the GR by the administration of the corticosteroids moves the drug-receptor complex into the nucleus of the cell and binds to the DNA. 11 The anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids are achieved by two distinct mechanisms. First, activated GR to specific DNA sequences located in the promoter regions of target genes to induce transcription of anti-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1 receptor, or Lipocortin 1 (transactivation). Second, an indirect negative regulation of gene expression is also achieved by GR-protein interaction (transrepression). The activated GR binds to key proinflammatory transcription factors such as activator protein 1 and nuclear factor \u03baB. The resulting complex inhibits the initiation of transcription of relevant genes that play a central role in inflammation. 11 For that reason, the synthesis of several cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis alpha [TNF\u03b1], ILs 4, 5, 6, and 13, adhesion molecules [e.g, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1], and chemokines [e.g., eotaxin and IL-8]) is inhibited. 13, 14 Experimental studies confirmed these anti-inflammatory effects in pneumonia. In a model of severe pneumonia in mechanically ventilated piglets, we observed lower lung cytokine concentrations and less lung bacterial burden in piglets that were treated with corticosteroids plus antibiotic compared with those treated only with antibiotics. 15 Previous in vitro studies using human monocytic cells demonstrated that corticosteroids suppress bacterial replication and intracellular bacteria. 16 In a mouse model of pneumonia induced by Escherichia coli, the administration of hydrocortisone reduced inflammatory response and the risk of death. 17 And in another mouse model of Mycoplasma pneumoniae respiratory infection, Tagliabue et al 18 showed that the association of corticosteroids and macrolides was histologically beneficial.",

Salluh et al 23 studied the impact of corticosteroids on the clinical course and outcomes of 111 patients with CAP requiring mechanical ventilation, where 55% of the patients received corticosteroids due to bronchospasm or septic shock. In this study, the adjunctive use of corticosteroids did not influence mortality, organ failure, or withdrawal of vasopressors. However, a recent Japanese study including 2,524 patients with severe CAP showed that low-dose corticosteroid therapy reduced 28-day mortality among those patients with CAP complicated by septic shock. 24 Nevertheless, this benefit was not observed among patients with severe CAP without septic shock. All of these findings suggested that corticosteroids may reduce mortality in patients with severe CAP. However, these observations may be due to the overinclusion of patients with septic shock or with other conditions known to benefit from corticosteroids treatment, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma.",

Confalonieri et al 25 assessed the efficacy and safety of continuous infusion of hydrocortisone in 46 patients with CAP requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. These authors demonstrated a mortality reduction in the group treated with corticosteroids, a better modulation of systemic inflammatory response, and significant improvement in clinical endpoints, such as chest X-ray, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome severity scale, PaO 2 :FiO 2 ratio, and ICU and hospital stay. The limitation of this study was the small sample size and differences among groups on admission, which limited the generability of these results. Snijders et al 26 studied the impact of prednisolone compared with placebo among 213 hospitalized patients with CAP. In this study, the authors found no differences regarding the rate of 30-day mortality, time to clinically stability, or length of hospital stay. Patients treated with corticosteroids had faster decline in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels compared with placebo. However, late clinical failure (>72 hours from admission) was more common in the corticosteroid group. Meijvis et al 27 evaluated the effect of intravenous (IV) dexamethasone versus placebo in the first 4 days after CAP admission in 304 patients. The authors found no differences in the main outcomes, including inhospital mortality, ICU admission, and severe adverse events. However, patients treated with corticosteroid had a shorter length of hospital stay compared with the placebo group. Fern\u00e1ndez-Serrano et al 28 described in a study of 56 hospitalized patients with CAP that combination of antibiotics with methylprednisolone improved respiratory failure rates and accelerated the timing of clinical resolution. No serious side effects related to corticosteroids were described in any of these clinical studies.",

In the corticosteroid group, treatment failure was less common (13 vs. 31%), especially in late treatment failure (3 vs. 25%). When individual components of treatment failure were evaluated, differences among groups were found in the radiographic progression (2% in the corticosteroid group vs. 15% in the control group). Inhospital mortality did not differ among groups, and no side effects related to corticosteroids were found.

A Cochrane meta-analysis 31 selected six RCTs of corticosteroids in pneumonia including 437 participants. The use of corticosteroids accelerated the resolution of symptoms and time to clinical stability. However, corticosteroids did not provide a benefit in mortality, and the authors concluded that it was not possible to make any definitive recommendations because the studies taken account in the meta-analysis were not strong enough. Nie et al 32 performed another meta-analysis including nine RCTs with 1,001 patients and showed that the use of corticosteroids was not associated with significant lower mortality considering all the patients (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.37-1.04). However, a survival benefit was detected in the subgroup of patients with severe CAP (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.11-0.64) and among patients with prolonged corticosteroids treatment (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.26-0.97). Prolonged corticosteroid treatment was defined as more than 5 days of corticosteroids treatment with a maximum of 9 days. Considering the adverse effects, corticosteroids increased the risk of hyperglycemia (OR: 2.64; 95% CI: 1.68-4.15), but without increasing the risk of superinfection (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.65-2.84) and gastroduodenal bleeding (OR: 1.67; 95% CI: 0.41-6.80). These results were very similar with another more recent systematic review and meta-analysis that included 2,077 patients from 14 trials. 33 Again, adjunctive corticosteroid therapy was associated with decreased 30-day mortality among patients with severe CAP (relative risk [RR]: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.23-0.96) but not in the whole CAP population. In addition, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a reduction of severe complications (RR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.23-0.56), a shorter length of stay (9.0 vs. 10.6 days), and a shorter time to clinical stability (3.3 vs. 4.3 days).

In contrast, another meta-analysis 35 including 13 RCT (2,005 patients) demonstrated a reduction in all causes of mortality in patients receiving corticosteroids (risk ratio: 0.67 [95% CI: 0.45-1.01]; risk difference: 2.8%).

There is still no definitive answer regarding the effect of corticosteroids on the decrease in mortality. Some meta-analysis suggested that corticosteroids can decrease mortality in the subgroup of patients with severe CAP. 32, 33, 35 However, main limitations of these studies are related to the inclusion of different classification of severity of illness and the use of different corticosteroid types and dosage, which make it difficult to compare the final results. Other Nonantibiotic Adjunctive Therapies Statins Statins are lipid-lowering drugs widely used in the prevention of adverse cardiovascular events. [36] [37] [38] In addition to their cardiovascular effect, different studies have also demonstrated that they have anti-inflammatory and direct antimicrobial activity effects, [39] [40] [41] which are related to improved outcomes in severe bacterial infections. [42] [43] [44] Several studies compared retrospectively outcomes in patients with CAP who were taking chronic statins at the time of the diagnosis. Van However, different RCT have been performed in the last 10 years with conflicting results (\u25baTable 3). Novack et al 41 evaluated the effect of statin therapy on inflammatory cytokines in patients with bacterial infections. In this study, the authors concluded that statin therapy was associated with a reduction in levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 levels). Two other RCTs evaluated the effect of statin therapy on mortality in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Makris et al 48 found a trend of increased survival in the pravastatin group but this did not reach statistical significance (p \u00bc 0.7). In this study, the authors stratified data according to median APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) scores and found a significantly increased probability of being free from VAP during the whole ICU period (p \u00bc 0.04) in the pravastatin group. However, in another RCT including 284 patients having suspected VAP, Papazian et al 49 showed that adjunctive statins therapy in VAP did not improve 28-day survival. In 2015, Viasus et al 50 evaluated the clinical outcomes and concentration of inflammatory cytokines in a randomized trial in patients with CAP treated with simvastatin and concluded that the use of simvastatin did not reduce the time to clinical stability or the levels of inflammatory cytokines in hospitalized patients with CAP.",

Some studies have evaluated the effects of exogenous administration of IGs in patients with sepsis (most of them due to CAP), with controversial results. 54 In a prospective RCT including 653 patients with severe sepsis, the administration of IgG did not show differences in 28-day mortality among groups. 55 However, two meta-analyses have reported improved outcomes in patients with sepsis. Kreymann et al 51 reported a reduction of mortality (around 20%) in adult patients with sepsis and septic shock who received administration of polyclonal IGs and a more evident effect on mortality in the subgroup receiving IgMenriched IG. A more recent meta-analysis by Cochrane 56 showed a reduction in mortality in the group treated with IG, although this effect disappeared analyzing only the methodological strongest trials. In summary, there is not enough evidence supporting the benefit of IGs for treatment of sepsis. Further studies for individualized treatment with IG are needed.",

In a sheep model of bacterial pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the administration of human MSCs was well tolerated and improved oxygenation and decreased pulmonary edema in those animals that developed severe ARDS. 59 Finally, Hackstein et al 60 demonstrated for the first time the feasibility and in vivo immunomodulatory capacity of prospectively defined stem cells in pneumonia. In this study, the authors isolated MSCs from murine bone marrow that were applied intratracheally 4 hours after acute respiratory Klebsiella pneumoniae induced infection. Those treated animals exhibited reduced airway inflammation and improved pneumonia survival. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical importance of this promising experimental data.",

Several RCT and meta-analyses has been performed, suggesting a clinical benefit of corticosteroids use, especially in the most severe population, although its impact on mortality remains controversial. Other adjunctive therapies such as statins and IGs have been tested, although the role of these options in the treatment of CAP is still not clear.
