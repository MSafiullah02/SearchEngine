Since that time, many viruses have been positively associated with numerous neurological and chronic diseases. The characterization of virus in affected tissues, increased risk of disease in immunosuppressed patients, and response of patients to antiviral therapy all point investigators toward an infectious etiology of the disease. Multiple viruses have been shown to produce demyelination, and a temporal association of postinfectious encephalomyelitis has been shown after smallpox vaccination and measles, varicella, or rubella infection. Viruses are capable of establishing persistent, latent infection in host organisms leading to continuous viral replication over time without killing the host. Reactivation of latent virus can produce clinical disease, although the stimulus of reactivation has yet to be characterized.",

One such example is the correlation of JC virus with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), the only human demyelinating disease with a proven viral cause. Another example is the temporal association of viruses with postinfectious encephalomyelitis, a demyelinating disorder that occurs as a complication of either smallpox vaccination or measles infection. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) leading to central nervous system (CNS) demyelination is another example that supports a role for virus in MS. Although a viral association with MS may be the result of primary infection, more likely it is the reactivation of virus years after the primary infection that leads to the development of MS, similar to JC virus in PML and TMEV, both of which result from reactivation of latent virus in the CNS that may lyse oligodendrocytes, initiating an immunopathological process that leads to demyelination (Gilden, 2005) .",

Epidemiological studies have supported both a genetic component and an environmental trigger in MS. These environmental triggers have been suggested to be transmissible agents such as a viral or bacterial infection. Although the immunology of MS is complex, further support for infectious triggers is indicated by the role of Th1-type CD4+ cells in disease pathogenesis. Th1 cells dominate viral infections and allow for the proliferation of CD8+ cells. In addition, studies have demonstrated increased CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in MS lesions, which suggests a role for these effector T cells in the pathogenesis of this disorder. The observation of increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses in MS further supports a role for infection in disease, as most diseases that show high concentrations of IgG are inflammatory and infectious in nature. The involvement of viral infections in MS coupled with the long-held view of MS as an autoimmune disease suggests that molecular mimicry may play a role in MS disease pathogenesis, as studies have found that myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cells can be effectively activated by MBP homologue from numerous viruses. This review highlights a number of these diverse observations that lend support to a viral etiology in MS.",

The pathological marker of disease is white matter lesions or plaques resulting from loss of axonal myelination due to inflammation, with noticeable lymphocyte infiltration and oligodendrocyte loss (Ffrench-Constant, 1994) . Lesions are characterized by demyelination, edema, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (Hemmer et al., 2002) . Symptoms of disease begin with recurring inflammatory attacks involving significant neurological impairment, ranging from vision problems and difficulty walking to paralysis (Steinman and Zamvil, 2003) . Although the cause of MS is unknown, it has typically been considered a CD4+ Th1 cell-mediated disease. Disease begins when the blood-brain barrier is breached, and activated immune cells attack components of the myelin sheath insulating axons. Epidemiological studies have suggested both a genetic and environmental component in MS, leaving open the possibility of a viral trigger in MS.",

The familial aggregation of disease, observed in population and family studies, shows an increased risk in first-, second-, and third-degree relatives over the general population (Dyment et al., 2004) . Adoption studies show an increased risk of developing MS only in biologically related individuals (Ebers et al., 1995) . In twin studies, monozygotic twins have a higher concordance rate than dizygotic twins (Haines et al., 1998) . Although the monozygotic twin concordance rate of 20% to 30% indicates that genetics can predispose an individual to MS, nongenetic factors such as environmental triggers and immune responses must play a role in determining the overall etiology of disease (Dyment et al., 2004) . The genetic component most often observed is the HLA-DR2 allele on chromosome 6p21, and this gene could contribute 10% to 60% of the genetic risk factor (Haines et al., 1998) . Allelic variants of chromosomal regions are linked to increased disease risk, and these MHC genes could predispose disease through thymic selection or presentation of antigen to T cells, or both (Ermann and Fathman, 2001) .",

A geographical gradient of north to south has been found, with the Northern Hemisphere having an increased prevalence of disease. The geographical distribution is not related to genetics alone, as the prevalence of disease in Caucasians who migrate outside of Europe or North America is one-half that of those living in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Migration studies found that the geographical risk is acquired by the age of 15, as migration from an area of high risk to one of low risk during adolescence confers a reduced risk of developing disease. One explanation for the geographical distribution observed is the reduced sunlight exposure at higher latitudes, as ultraviolet (UV) radiation may exert an effect on vitamin D or cause an excess of melatonin, which enhances Th1 responses (Sospedra and Martin, 2005) .",

In contrast, children in a more hygienic environment with low exposure to infectious disease, as is the case in developed countries, tend toward Th2 responsiveness, and these are the children who are thought to be more prone to developing atopic allergic disease.

Prospective studies have also shown that MS relapses often follow viral infections, and seasonal variation in the incidence of new MS cases exists. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) studies have also suggested a transmissible agent, as almost 100% of transgenic mice expressing T cell receptors (TCRs) specific for an encephalitogenic peptide of MBP develop EAE when housed in non-pathogen-free conditions, whereas those in pathogen-free conditions do not (Goverman et al., 1993) . Additionally, common viral infections are temporally associated with MS exacerbations in some patients (Sibley et al., 1985) . Many groups have searched for bacteria and viruses that may be associated with disease, and to date about 20 organisms have been associated, although none has gained acceptance as the causal agent of MS (Table 11 .1).",

            "text": "Like many other chronic inflammatory diseases, MS has traditionally been thought to be a CD4+ Th1-mediated disease. Naive T cells differentiate into Th1 cells in the presence of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) and into Th2 cells in the presence of IL-4 and/or IL-6. The presence of Th1-or Th2-type cytokines also function to inhibit the generation of the other response. Th1 cells dominate viral and bacterial infections owing to IL-12 (produced by dendritic cells and macrophages) and IFN\u03b3, produced by natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells. The two subsets of CD4+ cells have very different functions: Th1 (Huseby et al., 2001; Steinman, 2001b) . Previous to this, the focus of EAE research was on the role of myelin-specific CD4+ T cells because of their ability to induce EAE predominantly and lead to cytokine activation similar to that seen in MS (Steinman, 2001b) . Additionally, lesions in EAE induced by CD8+ CTLs for MBP closely resemble MS lesions and exhibit extensive demyelination, indicating that CD8+ CTLs are capable of damaging MHC I-expressing oligodendrocytes (Huseby et al., 2001) . CD8+ CTLs are the primary effector T cells that lyse virus-infected cells by recognizing short peptide fragments (usually nine amino acids in length) in association with HLA class I molecules (Neumann et al., 2002; Shresta et al., 1998; Trapani et al., 2000) . They are associated with antigen-specific apoptosis in the CNS, as their specificity for virus-infected cells prevents widespread tissue damage (Barry and Bleackley, 2002; Russell and Ley, 2002) . CTLs kill target cells by a number of mechanisms, including the Ca 2+ -dependent release of lytic granules and the Ca 2+ -independent binding of Fas to Fas-L on the CTLs leading to the activation of caspases (Barry et al., 2000; Green et al., 2003; Medana et al., 2000) . CD8+ CTLs accumulate around lesions in infectious and autoimmune neurological disorders including MS (Neumann et al., 2002) . It has come to be appreciated that MHC I-restricted CD8+ CTLs have been found to outnumber CD4+ T cells in MS lesions almost 10:1 (Booss et al., 1983 ). CD8+ CTLs have been shown to be enriched at the site of actively demyelinating lesions in MS (Monteiro et al., 1995) and the clonal proliferation of CD8+ CTL cells has been observed to be much greater than that of CD4+ cells in the T cell infiltrate in inflammatory lesions (Babbe et al., 2000) . CD8+ CTL responses to MHC I peptides of MBP are elevated in MS patients compared to healthy individuals, suggesting that CTLs specific for MBP may become activated in MS patients (Crawford et al., 2004) . Neuronal cells do not constitutively express the MHC I molecule necessary for CD8+ activation (Neumann et al., 2002) , but invading CD8+ CTLs release proinflammatory cytokines including IFN-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), and TNF\u03b2 (Medana et al., 2000; Woodland and Dutton, 2003) . IFN\u03b3 inhibits viral replication, activates macrophages, and induces the express of MHC I molecules on glial cells and neurons (Vass and Lassmann, 1990) .",

Each of these mechanisms involves the interaction of the virus with the immune system, \"priming\" the host for subsequent immunopathology by initiating the immunoreactivity that leads to autoimmune disease (Fujinami et al., 2006) . In molecular mimicry, T cells react in the periphery to foreign molecules with enough similarity to self-antigen, causing the T cells to become activated and allowing them to cross the blood-brain barrier (Wucherpfennig and Strominger, 1995) . Resting autoreactive T cells cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore must be activated in the periphery. Many microbial proteins share sequence homologies with components of the myelin sheath, most notably myelin oligodendroglial glycoprotein (MOG), MBP, and proteolipid protein (PLP); and this homology allows activated T cells to attack myelin (Steinman, 2001a) .",

A number of chronic human illnesses have been suggested to be \"triggered\" by microorganisms, and proving the infectious etiology of these diseases has required extensive support from multiple sources (Carbone, 2005) . The traditional rules for proof of pathogenicity, Koch's postulates, are often not practical when examining viral triggers, as it is rare that any single line of evidence is sufficient to prove an infectious nature of chronic disease. Proof is often realized only with the accumulation of sufficient and supportive data by multiple sources and techniques. Although it is extremely important to detect the suspected pathogen in diseased tissue, detection does not necessarily prove causality, as the organism could be an innocent bystander or endogenous flora-present but not a factor in the disease. Additionally, a lack of detection does not necessarily mean an association does not occur, as the method used may not be sensitive enough to detect low levels of virus. Any association must include evidence from multiple sources, including genetic, epidemiological, microbiological, and pathological components (Carbone et al., 2005) .",

Obviously, viral associations in human disease would be more compelling, using methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viral nucleic acid in human tissue or by measuring antibody levels in serum, plasma, or CSF. Often, prospective and retrospective serological studies are used to help elucidate the cause of chronic illness; but here too lie problems, as evidence of past exposure does not imply current infection, seronegative individuals could have past infection, antibody levels could decline over time, and often tests are not sensitive enough to detect low levels of virus present in chronic infection.",

Additionally, retroviruses have been implicated in immunodeficiency and neurological disorders, and RNA for HERVs may be upregulated during inflammation (Christensen, 2005) . As HERVs are ubiquitous, their pathogenicity must be modulated by genetic and environmental factors. The diversity of HERVs in the human genome is the result of homologous recombinations, as seen in the MHC region (Christensen, 2005) .",

Some studies have found that MS patients have increased concentrations of antibody to RT from HERVs compared to control patients, although other studies have had contradictory findings (Gilden, 2005) . Retrovirus-like particles (RVLPs) have been found in T cell cultures from patients with MS, and cultures also express EB virusencoded proteins (Haahr et al., 1991) . Multiple sclerosis-related virus (MSRV, previously known as LM7), a HERV, was first isolated from MS patients, and its expression has been associated with disease severity and duration, although increased expression has also been observed in other inflammatory neurological diseases (Dolei et al., 2002; Zawada et al., 2003) . It is unknown if HERVs are a causal factor in MSl; and if not causal they could be involved as a synergistic player, an immune activator or suppressor; alternatively, HERVs could be an epiphenomenon (Christensen, 2005) . HERVs or HERV-activated proteins could act as insertional mutagens, as regulators of gene expression, or they could interact with exogenous viral RNA or elicit abnormalities as viruses.",

Regardless of the significance, the cell-mediated immune response of HERV and herpesvirus antigens in conjunction has a stimulatory effect (Christensen., 2005) . The interaction of HERVs and herpesviruses is similar to situations found in vivo, as HERVs are ubiquitous in the genome and herpesviruses are highly prevalent throughout the human population; therefore an interaction between them is plausible. The herpesviruses could also function to induce aberrant expression of HERVs, as it has been found that the retroviruses human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human lymphtropic virus (HTLV) in the presence of herpesviruses encode transactivating factors that can exacerbate disease (Christensen, 2005) .

Second, HHV-6 has been shown to infect numerous cell types in the CNS, including lymphocytes and glial cells (He et al., 1996) . Third, herpesviruses are highly neurotropic and neuroinvasive, and they are often implicated in neurological diseases and other CNS complications (Wilborn et al., 1994) . Fourth, the high seroprevalence of HHV-6 throughout the world is consistent with the high prevalence of MS. Lastly, herpesviruses are able to establish persistent, latent infections in the CNS and can be reactivated as a result of stress or other infections, the same stressors that have also been associated with MS exacerbations. Although an association between HHV-6 and MS remains to be definitively proven, the large numbers of reports that demonstrate a role of this virus in MS pathogenesis (Fig. 11 .2) are compelling evidence that suggest that this may be an important area of investigation.",

These studies typically have measured long-term IgG titers in either serum or CSF as a measure of past exposure. By contrast, a number of compelling studies (Ablashi et al., 1998 (Ablashi et al., , 2000 Friedman et al., 1999; Ongradi et al., 1999; Soldan et al., 1997; Villoslada et al., 2003) have demonstrated significant elevations of HHV-6-specific IgM in the serum of MS patients compared to patients with other neurological diseases, other inflammatory diseases, and healthy controls (Soldan et al., 1997) . Detection of an early antibody response (IgM) to an early antigen of HHV-6 (p41/38) has suggested that active HHV-6 replication may be occurring in a subset of MS patients. Consistent with these HHV-6-specific IgM responses detected in MS sera, other studies have found an increased percentage of MS patients with anti-HHV-6 IgM in CSF. For example, Ongradi et al. demonstrated anti-HHV-6 IgM in 57% of MS patients and 0% of controls (Ongradi et al., 1999) . In addition to IgM responses, increased IgG antibodies to HHV-6 has been one of the most consistent findings in most of the studies (Fig. 11 .2) examining the role of HHV-6 in MS serum (Ablashi et al., 1998 (Ablashi et al., , 2000 Caselli et al., 2002; Liedtke et al., 1995; Ongradi et al., 1999; Sola et al., 1993 Sola et al., , 1997 Wilborn et al., 1994) ",

Although some reports have failed to support these findings (Enbom et al., 1999; Nielsen et al., 1997; Taus et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2002) the wide variety of assay platforms, use of different viral preparations, and variations in selection of patients and controls make it difficult to compare results among studies. There is a clear need to define a \"gold standard\" for HHV-6-specific IgG and IgM responses in both serum and CSF to better characterize the antibody response to HHV-6 in MS. Immune responses to HHV-6 have also been investigated by examining virus-specific T cell proliferation. In a study from our own group, although there was no difference between MS patients and controls in response to HHV-6B or HHV-7, a significantly higher percentage of MS patients demonstrated proliferative responses to HHV-6A . Increased frequency of HHV-6A specific T cells in MS is of interest because the HHV-6A variant has been suggested to be more neurotropic (Hall et al., 1998) and to have a greater propensity for latency and reactivation (Dewhurst et al., 1993) , and HHV-6A sequences are more often detected in MS sera Alvarez-Lafuente et al., 2002b) and CSF (Rotola et al., 2004) than variant B. More recently, T cells recognizing the recombinant 101-kDa protein of HHV-6 that corresponds to an immunodominant region of the virus occurred at a significantly lower precursor frequency in MS patients than controls . These responses were associated with a skewed cytokine profile characterized by the inability to produce IL-4 and IL-10. The authors concluded that the diminished T cell response to HHV-6 and skewed Th2 cytokine profile was associated with ineffective clearance of HHV-6 in MS, suggesting a role for this virus in MS disease pathogenesis .",

The detection of HHV-6 DNA in cell-free compartments (i.e., serum, CSF, urine) has been suggested to reflect potentially active HHV-6 replication, whereas detection of cell-associated (e,g. PBMCs) HHV-6 sequences may not be able to distinguish latent from active virus. Moreover, using HHV-6 variant-specific primers and probes, it is possible to distinguish HHV-6A from HHV-6B infection. Recently, real-time quantitative PCR methods have been used to measure HHV-6 viral loads accurately from PBMCs and CSF lymphocytes; and RT-PCR has been used to amplify HHV-6 mRNA sequences.

Alvarez-Lafuente and colleagues demonstrated HHV-6 mRNA for three immediate early (IE) genes by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in a substantial number of RRMS patients and not in healthy blood donors (Alvarez-Lafuente et al., 2002b) . As a method of distinguishing active from latent infection, this study compared mRNA expression of the IE genes U89/90, U16/17, and U94 with the expression of U94 alone. Presence of U94 in the absence of other IE gene transcripts has been associated with latent HHV-6 infection (Mirandola et al., 1998) . More MS patients were found to have mRNA for all three IE genes 202 Williams and Jacobson than U94 alone, indicating active HHV-6 infection in this subset of MS patients (Alvarez-Lafuente et al., 2002b) . No significant difference in U94 expression was found between MS patients and controls. Similar to the observations using immunological detection methods that suggest a role of HHV-6 in MS, most reports based on molecular methods support these findings (Fig. 11. 2), although with greater variability among these studies (Al-Shammari et al., 2003; Martin et al., 1997; Mirandola et al., 1999; Taus et al., 2000) . This is not unexpected as it is well appreciated in molecular PCR-based assays that there is considerable variability in the use of these methods. Different regions of the virus are amplified with different sets of primers and probes having varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity that are used in either primary or nested PCR conditions. Only through standardized PCR assays can these difficulties be overcome.",

Indeed, the first report of an association of HHV-6 with MS was based on the immunohistochemical detection of HHV-6 antigen in oligodendrocytes from MS plaques (Challoner) . This landmark study using an unbiased subtractive hybridization approach (representational differential analysis) demonstrated HHV-6-specific sequences in MS plaque material compared to controls. A more recent report also localized HHV-6 to oligodendrocytes in MS brains (Opsahl and Kennedy, 2005) . Although HHV-6 mRNA was detected in both MS and control brain tissue, higher levels of HHV-6 viral activity as determined by percentage of HHV-6 mRNA-positive oligodendrocytes were demonstrated in MS patients compared to controls (Opsahl and Kennedy, 2005) . In this study, quantitatively more HHV-6 mRNA to both immediate early and late genes was detected in MS lesions versus controls, suggestive of an active HHV-6 infection (Opsahl and Kennedy, 2005) .",

Cermelli et al., using laser microdissection, found statistically more HHV-6 DNA in active MS plaques than in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) from the same MS patients and brain material from patients with other neurological diseases including inflammation (Cermelli et al., 2003) . These findings are consistent with previous studies that demonstrated HHV-6 DNA by PCR more often in brain tissue from MS patients than in controls (Friedman et al., 1999; Sanders et al., 1996) . In a case report of brain biopsies from five MS patients, all sections demonstrated high levels of HHV-6 DNA-positive cells by in situ PCR, most of which were oligodendrocytes (Goodman et al., 2003) . Although HHV-6 DNA was detected in oligodendrocytes, HHV-6 antigen was not, using immunohistochemical analysis for HHV-6 p41, p101, or gp116. However, HHV-6 antigen was detected in hypertrophic astrocytes to the HHV-6 gp116 protein staining in two of the five patients (Goodman et al., 2003) . The authors concluded that the prevalence of HHV-6 genome-containing cells in MS lesions support the hypothesis that HHV-6 plays a role in the demyelinative pathogenesis of MS. The demonstration of HHV-6 in pathological material is crucial to support the association of this agent in this disorder. Although studies using different antibodies have found HHV-6 antigen more often in MS patients than controls (Friedman et al., 1999; Knox et al., 2000; Virtanen et al., 2005) , others have not (Blumberg et al., 2000; Coates and Bell, 1998) . Clearly, more studies are needed to qualitatively and quantitatively detect both HHV-6 genome and HHV-6 antigen(s) in the CNS of MS patients.",

Even more compelling are the clinical correlative studies between virus and MS disease development or progression. As most MS patients are clinically defined by relapses and remissions, a number of reports have investigated whether HHV-6 can be differentially detected during these phases of disease. A significant correlation was demonstrated between serum HHV-6 DNA and the number of MS patients with clinical exacerbations, diagnosed by patient complaints and neurological examination (Berti et al., 2002) . The detection of HHV-6 DNA more often in patient serum during exacerbation than remission suggests that active HHV-6 infection may play a role in the development and/or progression of MS (Berti et al., 2002) . These findings were supported by others who found a higher viral load of HHV-6 in MS patients during exacerbations than during remissions for three different IE HHV-6 genes: U89/90, U16/17, and U94 (Alvarez-Lafuente et al., 2004b) . Similarly, Chapenko et al. identified periods of HHV-6 viremia by detecting HHV-6 DNA in plasma only during periods of new MS activity (exacerbations), as indicated by the presence of gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced lesions, and not during periods of relative remission, as indicated by an absence of Gd-enhanced lesions (Chapenko et al., 2003) . The study concluded that the risk of exacerbation was 2.5 times greater in patients with active HHV-6 infection than in those with latent infection. We have also observed that serum HHV-6 levels cycle over time by a longitudinal analysis of monthly serum samples (24-month time course) (Berti et al., 2002) . As it is known that Gd-enhanced MRI lesions also cycle, more patients must be evaluated to determine if there is a correlation between HHV-6 and these lesions.",

One study found that valacyclovir, the valine ester of acyclovir with increased bioavailability, did not reduce the formation of active lesions over the 24-week course of treatment (Bech et al., 2002) . However, a subgroup of MS patients with high disease activity, as measured by more than one active MRI lesion, valacyclovir was found to have reduced numbers of new active MRI lesions (Bech et al., 2002) . In a more recent clinical trial in MS patients, valacyclovir, though the results were not statistically significant, was found to have a stabilizing effect on clinical progression of disease (Friedman et al., 2005) .",

First, the choice of drug is critical, particularly with respect to HHV-6, as it is not clear what is the most effective anti-HHV-6 compound to use. Is the intent to interfere with HHV-6 replication in the periphery or CNS-and in which cell type (e.g., virus-infected lymphocytes or glial cells)? Second, which group of MS patients should one select? If HHV-6 plays a role in only a subset of patients, how is this group to be selected and what assay(s) should be used to monitor patients? Lastly, what clinical and/or radiological measures are to be used as a primary outcome measure of treatment efficacy? The MS trial design has made significant advances over the years with a number of drugs approved for the treatment and many more in the pipeline (McFarland and Reingold, 2005; Mouzaki et al., 2004) . If antiviral drugs are to be part of the armamentarium for MS, these drugs must be shown to interfere with virus growth or replication in patients with detectable levels of virus. If these criteria are met, coupled with clinical and/or radiological improvement with antiviral therapy, there can be confidence for an etiological role of a virus in MS.",
