Chronic nasopharyngitis and allergic rhinitis were excluded from the study. The volunteers had no skin pathologies and were willing to follow up study restrictions. No medication was allowed. Exclusion criteria were summarized in an information letter. Study approval was obtained from the local Ethics Commission of the University Hospital Brussels (Jette, Belgium). The study was conducted between October and the end of March. Upon recruitment, all subjects received paper handkerchiefs (not pretreated), wrapped in anonymous plastic foils (Procter & Gamble, Schwalbach am Taunus, Germany). Volunteers were instructed to use only these handkerchiefs for nose cleansing and not to reuse a single handkerchief. No lotions, creams, decorative cosmetics, and other skin care products in the face were allowed from the first symptoms of the cold until the end of the study. During the course of the cold, the subjects recorded in a diary their experiences, the amount of individual handkerchiefs used per day, and the number of days their cold continued. Three assessment points were scheduled: day onset: very first start of the cold symptoms; day max: culminating point of the viral cold, at least 3 days of hanky use; day recovery: completely recovered from the cold, at least 2 weeks after the last handkerchief use. Evaluations were always carried out at the same hour of the day to exclude influences of circadian rhythmicity 4, 5.",

Room conditions for day max and day recovery were 20.4 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C and 20.5 \u00b1 0.4\u00b0C (temperature) and 50.2 \u00b1 2.9% and 47.8 \u00b1 2.8% (relative humidity), respectively. After a premeasurement rest of at least 30 min in this climate\u2010controlled room, visual grading was carried out. The \u2018specified symptom sum score system\u2019 (0, absent; 4, extreme situation) was used to score the clinical assessments of skin erythema and dryness/scaliness 6, 7. Biophysical tools from Courage + Khazaka electronic (K\u00f6ln, Germany) were the Tewameter TM210\u00ae measuring TEWL by the open gradient technique, the Corneometer CM825\u00ae (electrical capacitance) and the Skin pH meter PH900\u00ae (apparent skin pH). The Chromameter CR300\u00ae (Minolta, Osaka, Japan) was used for skin colour measurements. Quantitative squamometry making use of D\u2010Squame\u00ae discs (\u00d8 2.2 cm; Cuderm Corporation, Dallas, TX, USA) was conducted according to the methodology previously described by our group (8). Nasolabial SSLs were collected from the hydrolipidic layer by two consecutive single tape strips (1 \u00d7 3 cm; Leukoflex\u2122, Beiersdorf, Germany). HPTLC analysis of the latter SSLs was based on the extraction method and quantitative densitometry, as published by Weerheim and Ponec (9). Lipid standards, representative for SSLs (squalene, triglycerides, cholesterol, cholesterol esters, free fatty acids, and wax esters), were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA) to set up calibration curves. To avoid interference with the biophysical tools, squamometry and SSL samplings were carried out after the skin measurements.",

TEWL values measured on zone 4 did not show significant differences between both assessment points underlying the observation that day recovery took place under the same meteorological conditions as day max. This means that no winter climate\u2010induced skin changes occurred and that the observed perturbations at the level of the skin barrier were completely because of the complications of the nasal cold and the frequent use of paper handkerchiefs. The skin barrier impairment observed for zone 2 on day max was also confirmed by the chromametrically assessed skin erythema values (chroma a*), which were significantly higher for zone 2L (Table 2) compared with those of day recovery.",

            "text": "The majority of common colds are associated with nasal congestion and periods of serous nasal discharge (rhinorrhea), requiring frequent nose cleansing with handkerchiefs (1). When having a cold, the skin of the outer lower edges of the nostrils as well as the skin area below the outside of the nose holes and the centre directly below the nose bridge can be quite painful. Subsequently, these skin areas often display erythema and scaliness. It was hypothesized that this characteristic feature possibly is because of maceration of the skin from the serous nasal secretion and, more importantly, frequent rubbing with handkerchiefs. The present study results show that skin erythema and visually scored scaliness are indeed the most characteristic skin symptoms of a nasal cold. Together with the disrupted and inferior nasolabial skin barrier, marked by increased TEWL measurements, this clinical feature aggravates the discomfort of patients suffering from a cold. As changes in season and climate are important variables to consider during this type of study, evaluation of zone 4 was included to create an internal control for each of the participating volunteers throughout the complete duration of the experiment. This test area on the forehead \u2013 superior to the nervus supraorbitalis \u2013 was selected because it provides stable and reproducible TEWL values on both sides of the forehead (10).",

It seems that the quality of the paper material used for nose cleansing could play an important role and that soft handkerchiefs would cause less damage on the hydrolipidic film and the skin barrier when having a cold. Soft paper handkerchiefs might then fulfil a preventive role in minimizing the damaging effect of the skin barrier function of the nasolabial zone. Consequently, during innovative product development, the first focus should lay on creating soft paper handkerchiefs. Second, one can also introduce a protective layer that may replenish the deteriorated superficial lipid barrier film. Such a comparative study between a pretreated paper handkerchief and its untreated control tissue is currently being carried out in a large population of volunteers suffering from an acute viral cold (11).",
