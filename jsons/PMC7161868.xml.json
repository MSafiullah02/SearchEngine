            "text": "Acyclic analogs of nucleosides belong to the most important class of compounds showing antiviral and antitumor activities 1, 2. Among them, acyclovir and penciclovir exhibit activity against herpes viruses including HSV\u20101, HSV\u20102, VZV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, while ganciclovir 7, 8, 9, 10 and valganciclovir \u2212 its prodrug with significantly improved oral bioavailability 10, 11, 12 \u2212 are commonly used as anti\u2010cytomegalovirus agents. However, in most cases, the clinical applications of nucleosides are limited due to the observed side effects. In addition, an important problem in treatment of viral infections is the emergence of drug\u2010resistant mutant viruses. For this reason, the search for new antiviral compounds with improved activity has been continuing for decades. This is not limited to modifications of aliphatic chains, but also includes the introduction of additional groups into the structure of nucleosides with well\u2010documented biological activity. Since the 1,2,3\u2010triazole moiety has been recognized as bioisosteric with the amide function 13, 14, the incorporation of this structural motive has been widely applied and resulted in a broad spectrum of pharmaceutically important molecules. Furthermore, 1,2,3\u2010triazoles are able to form hydrogen bonds, they are not protonated at the physiological pH, and are also stable to oxidation and reduction as well as to many enzymatic reactions 15. Several compounds of the 1,2,3\u2010triazole family have exhibited a broad spectrum of biological activities, such as anti\u2010inflammatory 16, 17, anticonvulsants 18, antiviral 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, anticancer 24, 25, 26, 27, antimicrobial agents 28, 29, 30, as well as \u03b2\u2010lactamase inhibitors 31 and dopamine D2 receptor ligands related to schizophrenia 32. Since 1997, when the first acyclic 1,2,3\u2010triazolenucleosides have been obtained by Lazrek et al. 33, 34, many efforts have been made by several research groups to synthesize more potent antiviral and anticancer nucleoside analogs having both natural and modified nucleobases (Fig. 1) 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49.",

Unfortunately, in this method, the selective N\n1\u2010debenzoylation step appeared less effective and tedious.

At first, attempts at benzylation of N\n1\u2010propargylquinazoline\u20102,4\u2010dione 29 following the strategy previously described 67 for the synthesis of N\n1\u2010allylated N\n3\u2010benzoylquinazoline\u20102,4\u2010dione were undertaken. Treatment of 29 with benzyl bromide in the presence of potassium hydroxide at 105\u00b0C for 4 h or 60\u00b0C for 48 h led to the formation of ca. a 50:50 mixture of an alkyne 31a and an allene 43a in 79% total yield. Unfortunately, several attempts at elaborating the efficient procedure to separate N\n3\u2010benzyl\u2010N\n1\u2010propargylquinazoline\u20102,4\u2010diones 31a from N\n3\u2010benzyl\u2010N\n1\u2010(propa\u20101,2\u2010dien\u20101\u2010yl)quinazoline\u20102,4\u2010diones 43a on silica gel columns or by crystallization proved fruitless. Fortunately, we were able to chromatographically isolate a small amount of pure allene 43a. Attempts to optimize a procedure for benzylation of 29, thereby avoiding formation of allenes 43 were undertaken. Thus, the treatment of N\n1\u2010propargylquinazoline\u20102,4\u2010dione 29 with benzyl bromide in the presence of potassium carbonate in DMF at room temperature for 48 h afforded pure N\n3\u2010benzyl\u2010N\n1\u2010propargylquinazoline\u20102,4\u2010dione 31a and no traces of the allene 43a were observed.",

Confluent cell cultures (or nearly confluent for MDCK cells) in microtiter 96\u2010well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque\u2010forming units (PFU).

Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus\u2010infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or concentration required reducing virus\u2010induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque (VZV) formation by 50%. The minimal cytotoxic concentration (MCC) of the compounds was defined as the compound concentration that caused a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. Alternatively, cytotoxicity of the test compounds was measured based on inhibition of cell growth. HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 \u00d7 103 cells/well into 96\u2010well microtiter plates and allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After 3 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC50, or the compound concentration required reducing cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls.",
