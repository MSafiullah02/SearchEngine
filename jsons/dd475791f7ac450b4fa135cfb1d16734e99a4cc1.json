These factors contribute to making infants \"obligate\" nasal breathers. The cricoid cartilage is the narrowest point of the airway in children younger than 10 years of age as opposed to the glottis in the adult. Even minimal edema will have a proportionately greater effect in children because of their smaller tracheal diameters. In older children, prominent adenoidal and tonsillar tissue can obstruct visualization of the larynx. Also, there are specific congenital anatomic airway anomalies that occur in children which makes management of the airway even more complex.

This decrease in lateral pressure (i.e. the distending pressure keeping the collapsible tube open) causes the tube to narrow, leading to partial obstruction. In addition, according to the Bernoulli principle, the velocity of a gas increases as it flows through a partially obstructed tube, creating an additional decrease in intraluminal pressure and further exacerbating the obstruction ( Fig. 2.5 ). This pattern of intermittent flow produces audible sounds that are characterized (depending upon the level of partial obstruction) as stertor, gurgling, stridor, wheezes, rhonchi, and rales.

The child's level of consciousness should be assessed immediately, as an obtunded or unconscious child may require immediate control of the airway. Restlessness, anxiety, diaphoresis are usually signs of air hunger and hypoxemia. Drooling or the inability to handle oral secretions results from an inability to swallow secondary to pain or swelling of affected tissues and is typically seen with supraglottic pathology (e.g. supraglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess). Accessory muscle use is an additional sign of increased work of breathing and is indicative of compromised gas exchange. During quiet breathing, airflow is laminar and resistance to airflow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the airway radius as stipulated by Poiseuille's law. When airflow is turbulent (e.g., during crying) resistance to airflow is inversely proportional to the fifth power of radius such that even a minor reduction in the cross-sectional area of the airway will result in a marked increase in airflow resistance and work of breathing. For these reasons, the infant or child with airway obstruction should be kept calm and as quiet as possible to prevent generation of turbulent airflow, increased airway resistance, and worsening respiratory distress. In general, any child in severe respiratory distress will assume a position that maximizes oxygenation and ventilation and should be allowed to remain in this position of comfort. For example, the child with supraglottitis will sit erect with the head tilted forward in the sniffing position, whereas a child with a retropharyngeal abscess will assume a head tilt or opisthotonus posture because of spasm of the muscles supporting the cervical spine [1, 2, 8, 9] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 243, "end": 246, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 247, "end": 249, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 250, "end": 252, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 253, "end": 255, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1962, "end": 1965, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1966, "end": 1968, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1971, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1972, "end": 1974, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical Manifestations of Airway Obstruction"}, {"text": "The clinical spectrum of infectious causes of upper airway obstruction has changed dramatically in the last few decades, especially following the introduction of vaccines against diphtheria and Haemophilus influenzae.

Helium-oxygen mixtures create conditions that favor laminar flow as opposed to turbulent flow. Recall that airway resistance is inversely proportional to the airway radius to the fifth power (r 5 ) under conditions of turbulent air flow (versus airway radius to the fourth power when laminar flow is present). Helium is a colorless, odorless gas with the lowest density of any gas except hydrogen. In addition, helium is more viscous than ambient air. As such, helium will reduce the Reynolds number and change a turbulent flow pattern to a laminar flow pattern, resulting in lower airway resistance and improved bulk flow [15, 16, 67] . Helium-oxygen gas (Heliox) mixtures have been shown to improve the work of breathing and gas exchange in children with croup [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . Heliox has few side effects and is easy to administer by face mask, hood, high-flow nasal cannula, or via a tracheal tube in children on mechanical ventilatory support [74] . In order to minimize the risk of asphyxia secondary to administration of 100 % helium, helium-oxygen mixtures should only be administered from pre-mixed helium-oxygen cylinders. Currently, 80:20 helium-oxygen and 70:30 helium:oxygen mixtures are available. Therefore, children with a high oxygen requirement are unlikely to benefit (and may actually worsen) from heliox administration.

The vasoconstrictive properties of racemic epinephrine and its proven efficacy in the treatment of croup have led to its routine immediately following extubation in many neonatal and pediatric ICUs [42-47, 187, 188] . The use of corticosteroids in the prevention and/or treatment of post-extubation stridor are advocated by many pediatric intensivists, though there is very little evidence to support the universal use of corticosteroids at this time. Dexamethasone at a dose of 1-1.5 mg/kg/day divided every 6-8 h (maximum daily dose 40 mg/day) has also been administered in an attempt to interrupt the progressive cycle of inflammation that results in edema of injured tissue following extubation. Again, the evidence that this therapy prevents re-intubation is limited [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] [195] [196] , though one meta-analysis suggested a possible benefit [193] . Regardless, in a national survey of pediatric critical care fellowship program directors, 66 % of those surveyed continue to rely on the air leak test and use corticosteroids to prevent post-extubation stridor and extubation failure. Further, the majority stated that they would delay extubation and administer corticosteroids in the presence an air leak of \u2265 30 cm H 2 O [194] . Finally, helium-oxygen mixtures (see preceding discussion) have also been used in several studies [195] [196] [197] [198] [199] [200] [201] . Heliox should be viewed only as a temporizing measure until either the aforementioned therapies become effective or the disease process naturally resolves. In the majority of cases, post-extubation stridor is self limited, though re-intubation is occasionally required. Unfortunately, re-intubation further exacerbates the reactive airway edema. Ideally, a smaller tracheal tube (generally one size smaller) than previously used should be placed with the hope of causing less airway injury. The new tracheal tube is generally left in place until air-leak is observed 24-48 h later. Anatomic airway problems like subglottic stenosis, tracheal compression, etc should be considered if post-extubation stridor persists following the second attempt at extubation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 172, "end": 177, "text": "[184]", "ref_id": "BIBREF183"}, {"start": 178, "end": 183, "text": "[185]", "ref_id": "BIBREF184"}, {"start": 184, "end": 189, "text": "[186]", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 533, "end": 550, "text": "[42-47, 187, 188]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1112, "text": "[189]", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 1113, "end": 1118, "text": "[190]", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1124, "text": "[191]", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1130, "text": "[192]", "ref_id": "BIBREF191"}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1136, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": "BIBREF192"}, {"start": 1137, "end": 1142, "text": "[194]", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 1143, "end": 1148, "text": "[195]", "ref_id": "BIBREF194"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1154, "text": "[196]", "ref_id": "BIBREF195"}, {"start": 1211, "end": 1216, "text": "[193]", "ref_id": "BIBREF192"}, {"start": 1591, "end": 1596, "text": "[194]", "ref_id": "BIBREF193"}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1702, "text": "[195]", "ref_id": "BIBREF194"}, {"start": 1703, "end": 1708, "text": "[196]", "ref_id": "BIBREF195"}, {"start": 1709, "end": 1714, "text": "[197]", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1720, "text": "[198]", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 1721, "end": 1726, "text": "[199]", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 1727, "end": 1732, "text": "[200]", "ref_id": "BIBREF199"}, {"start": 1733, "end": 1738, "text": "[201]", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Post-extubation Stridor"}, {"text": "Foreign body aspiration is an important cause of accidental death in infants and young children, compounded by the fact that infants seem to place almost any object in their mouths [202] .

The clinical presentation depends upon the location of the foreign body as well as the degree of obstruction. Importantly, the actual aspiration event is not always identified and a high index of suspicion is required. Foreign bodies that are lodged in the glottic or subglottic airway (extrathoracic obstruction) often produce symptoms that mimic croup such as sudden onset of stridor and respiratory distress. In contrast, foreign bodies lodged in the distal trachea (intrathoracic obstruction) tend to produce coughing and wheezing, mimicking asthma or bronchiolitis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 186, "text": "[202]", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Foreign Body Aspiration"}, {"text": "The most commonly aspirated foreign bodies include vegetable matter like peanuts, grapes, and popcorn [202] .

Children with a history of choking and respiratory distress should undergo immediate rigid bronchoscopy, which is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Radiographs may be helpful if the child is otherwise stable. Most distal tracheal or bronchial foreign objects can often be identified on inspiratory/expiratory films, lateral decubitus films, or chest fluoroscopy. Lateral neck radiographs are helpful if the foreign body is radio-opaque ( Fig. 2.11 ). However, most aspirated foreign bodies are not radiopaque and lodge in the bronchi. The presence of atelectasis (i.e. distal to a bronchus that is completely occluded by a foreign body) or air trapping and hyperinflation (i.e. distal to a partially-obstructing foreign body), which are viewed best on expiratory films, are findings that are highly suggestive of foreign body aspiration (Fig. 2.12 ) [205, 206] .

The severity of airway obstruction dictates the extent of the initial evaluation and management. An unstable airway should be immediately secured using the flexible bronchoscope.
