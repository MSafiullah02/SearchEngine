Doyle and Hutchings [3] described the disease caused by TGEV in America for the first time. TGEV was then spreading to various continents: North America (Canada, 1989), Europe (England, 1957), and Asia (Japan, 1956, Korea, 2000, and Thailand, 2000). In China, TGEV was reported in the 1960s, and widespread outbreaks have occurred since 2010 [4]. In the 1970s, PEDV was first reported in Europe [5, 6]. Subsequently, the virus affected Asian countries extensively, and PEDV infection was usually mild before 2010. The current virulent PEDV strains appeared in 2010 in China. Then, an outbreak occurred in Ohio in the USA in 2013, which spread throughout the USA. Since then, PEDV has resulted in significant economic damage worldwide and is thus receiving increased attention around the world [7].",

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of up to approximately 30 kb with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail [8]. They are capable of cross-species transmission and may gain new features. CoVs are significant infectious agents involved in gastroenteric, respiratory, hepatic, and neuronal diseases in animals and humans, causing cough and diarrhea, as well as high mortality rates, and bringing huge damage to human health and society [9]. \u03b1- and \u03b2-CoVs infect mammals such as humans and swine. By contrast, \u03b3- and \u0394-CoVs are mostly detected in birds, such as Bulbul coronavirus HKU11, Thrush coronavirus HKU12, and Munia coronavirus HKU13. Both \u03b3- and \u0394-CoVs have also been found in mammals [10]. \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u0394-CoVs are 4 genera of Coronaviridae that are clustered together based on numerous studies and serological and genotypic criteria (Table 1). Each genus has its own representative CoV species. TGEV, PEDV, and human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) are typical viruses of the genus \u03b1-CoV. The representative species of \u03b2-CoV are mouse hepatitis virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Infectious bronchitis virus is currently the most studied virus in the \u03b3-CoV genus [11]. Little is known about \u0394-CoV.",

It is the largest glycoprotein of CoVs [16], projecting out from the surface of CoV particles and forming a homotrimer structure called a peplomer. The S protein is responsible for the corona-like appearance of the surface projections in the electron microscope. The peplomer includes a globular portion and a protein stalk. By adopting the helical structure that is characteristic of class I virus fusion proteins, the protein stalk connects the globular portion to the transmembrane domain [17]. The N-terminal S1 domain constitutes the globular region, and the stalk is made up of the membrane-proximal S2 domain. The N-terminal S1 domain and C-terminal S2 domain of the S protein play a similar role in all CoVs, the S1 region is related to receptor binding, and the S2 domain plays a role in the membrane fusion process. In addition, the S1 domain contains two subdomains, an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (Fig. 2). The two subdomains, called RBDs (receptor binding domains), bind with specific cell receptors, including a series of proteins and sugars. Thus, determinants in the S1 domain are not only crucial for initiating virus entry into cells, they also determine the cell and host tropism of CoVs [12].",

The TGEV S protein is produced as a 1,447-amino acid precursor polypeptide with a 16-residue signal peptide. According to analysis of the S protein sequences of CoVs with different biological phenotypes, there are 4 antigenic sites (C, B, D, and A in that order) in the N-terminal half of the S protein, among which the A site can induce neutralizing antibodies [4] and is highly conserved in TGEV and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), a respiratory variant of TGEV. The S protein encoded by PRCoV lacks about 200 amino acids in the N-terminal region that contain determinants related to the enteropathogenicity of TGEV [18]. PEDV has a 150- to 220-kDa spike glycoprotein with a homotrimeric structure. The PEDV S protein is also a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that contains 5 regions, a signal peptide (residues 1-20), an S1 region (residues 21-793), an S2 region (residues 794-1385), a transmembrane domain (residues 1335-1358), and a cytoplasmic tail (residues 1359-1385) [19]. The S1 region is responsible for virus particle binding to the cellular receptors, whereas the S2 region participates in membrane fusion of the virus and host cells. Like other CoVs, the S1 region possesses two subdomains comprising an NTD (residues 21-324) and a CTD (residues 253-638). The CTD of the S1 domain binds to a functional cellular receptor for PEDV infection. Sequence analyses of PEDV prototype and variant strains reveal that the N terminus of the S protein changes more easily than the C terminus. In addition, a previous report suggested an interaction of NTD of the S1 domain with a coreceptor [20, 21].",

Previous studies on the CTD concluded that the structure had the characteristic of independent expression of the S protein and preservation of its native structure maintained the binding specificity [4]. Several structural studies indicate that the \u03b1-CoV RBD adopts a \u03b2-barrel fold with 2 highly twisted \u03b2-sheets, in which 3 \u03b2-strands (\u03b21, \u03b23, and \u03b27) run parallel and 3 disulfide bonds exist in the 3 \u03b2-structures [22]. The RBD of TGEV is located within the CTD of the S1 domain [23]. In the TGEV RBD crystal structure, the bent-strand \u03b25 crosses both \u03b2-sheets. N-linked glycans are concentrated at one side of the \u03b2-barrel; the opposite side is not glycosylated and might be closer to other S protein domains. The N- and C-terminal ends of the RBD are located on the same side of the domain (terminal side); at the opposite side, 2 \u03b2-turns form the tip of the barrel in the TGEV RBD [12].",

Compared with the TGEV S domain, the related PRCoV lacks the NTD, which is related to enteric tropism.

            "text": "During the progress of evolution and adaptation to diverse hosts, CoVs have evolved to use various receptors to enter host cells. Different hosts or virus strains produce evolutionary diversity in the same virus family, and the binding of CoVs to susceptible cells seems to show variation in the receptors used that correspond to viral groups and species. These CoVs recognize distinct cellular receptors and coreceptors, such as proteins and sugars, to facilitate their penetration into cells [8]. Currently, there are 4 main protein receptors: APN, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Most members of \u03b1-CoV use APN as the receptor for infecting host cells, such as TGEV, PEDV, and HCoV-229E. APN, also known as CD13, is a 150-kDa type II transmembrane protein that belongs to a membrane-bound metalloprotease family [24]. Interestingly, HCoV-NL63, as an \u03b1-CoV, shares the same cell entry receptor, identified as ACE2, with SARS-CoV, which is a \u03b2-CoV. ACE2 is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein with an N-terminal extracellular domain comprising 2 \u03b1-helical lobes, between both of which there is a catalytic site with a coordinated zinc ion [25]. By contrast, the \u03b2-CoV mouse hepatitis virus utilizes CEACAM1 as a cell surface receptor for the S protein. CEACAM1, the first identified CoV receptor [26], is a type I transmembrane multifunctional protein and a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily termed IgSF. Middle East respiratory syndrome-related CoV, belonging to \u03b2-CoV, has been shown to use DPP4 as a cell entry receptor. DPP4 (also known as CD26), a type II membrane protein, is a multifunctional membrane-bound serine protease that forms homodimers on the surface of host cells. The DPP4 ectodomain comprises about 730 amino acids and has 2 domains, an \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase domain and an 8-bladed propeller [27]. Among these cellular receptors and coreceptors, APN is a major cell entry receptor for CoVs. APN exists on the epithelial cell surface of different tissues. In particular, it is expressed abundantly in the brush border membrane of the small intestine, the kidney, and the respiratory tract [28]. Most \u03b1-CoVs use APN as cell entry receptor. For example, previous studies showed that TGEV uses porcine (p) APN as the receptor in the entry process [24], whereas human (h) APN is a receptor for the infection by HCoV-229E [29].",

            "text": "The reason why TGEV uses APN as an entry receptor has not been clarified. It might be linked to its abundance on the surface of epithelial cells rather than its biological function, which seems to be dispensable for CoV binding capacity [30, 31]. In the small intestine mucosa, APN occupies about 8% of the total protein content of the differentiated enterocytes [32]. For PEDV, although there are many articles in which pAPN was proposed as the receptor in PEDV infection, this view has been questioned due to the lack of robust direct evidence. The characteristic structure of APN is a large glycosylated ectodomain with a zinc metal ion at the active site, which functions as a zinc-dependent protease responsible for cleavage of the N-terminal amino acids, mediated by the HELAH motif [33]. The enzymatic function of the pAPN catalyzes the removal of amino acid residues from the N termini of oligopeptides, and APN has been termed the \u201cmoonlighting enzyme\u201d because of its many cell functions. APN can be cleaved into N-terminal (95 kDa) and C-terminal (50 kDa) subunits by trypsin digestion and comprises 4 domains (DI-DIV) [29, 32]. It is heavily glycosylated and forms dimers through extensive DIV-DIV interactions. Sequence conservation in the RBD tip of \u03b1-CoVs exerts a crucial function in which the APN recognition mode is highly conserved [29]. Moreover, the specificity of APN with the recognition structure in the S protein is linked to the structure of the APN N-linked glycan and fusion with the RBD \u03b21-\u03b22 turn. In addition, the CoVs tyrosine and tryptophan residues are critical in forming the TGEV RBD-APN structure. HCoV-229E does not have a tyrosine in its RBD \u03b21-\u03b22 turn, hence it recognizes the human APN that lacks this form of glycosylation [20, 34], meaning that HCoV-229E recognition of APN must be unique. There have been some studies that determined the structure of a protruding tip for binding to small APN cavities in this human \u03b1-CoV. The S proteins of PEDV and TGEV share high homology, but they have different host preferences. In addition, PEDV has been verified to use a different receptor recognition model compared with TGEV, PRCoV, and HCoV-NL63. The N-terminal region in the PEDV S1 domain binds to sugars, which are regarded as its coreceptor [20].",

The sialic acid binding activity resides in the N-terminal portion of the S1 subunit that has been linked to the enteropathogenicity of TGEV and that is absent from the S protein of PRCoV. The sialic acid preferentially recognized by TGEV is N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) [37]. The spike protein has a trimeric structure and retains its sialic acid binding activity in soluble forms of the protein [38, 39]. TGEV recognizes and binds the sugar moieties of glycoconjugates that are highly O-glycosylated which promotes binding but is not sufficient for initiation of infection. It is believed that abundant sialic acid in mucins aids TGEV to penetrate the mucus layer and then to get access to pAPN on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, the efficiency of infection can be enhanced under unfavorable conditions. Binding to pAPN and sialic acid are two independent processes. Interestingly, binding to pAPN is more efficient in the absence of sialic acid [40].",

Another study showed that nonpermissive ST cells expressing a pAPN gene supported productive infection of PEDV of the host cells, showing that constitutive overexpression of pAPN directly promotes PEDV multiplication [29]. In summary, pAPN more likely functions as a protease in PEDV infection rather than as a receptor, which is supported by research evidence; however, the mechanism by which pAPN promotes PEDV infection remains unknown.",

Low pH is necessary for conformational changes of viral glycoproteins and proteolytic activation of viral glycoproteins by endosomal proteases [61]. It is reported that pH-dependent conformational changes occur in the CoV peplomer [62], and the S1 domain is released from peplomers on the surface of the virus. Inside the endosome, endogenous proteases participating in membrane fusion are active in a low-pH environment. TGEV and PEDV tend to multiply at a low pH. The amount of TGEV in the medium at pH 6.5 was 10-fold greater than that at pH 7.2, and the yield was almost 100-fold higher than that at pH 8.0 [63].",

The endosomal cellular elements are very important for the activation of low pH-dependent proteases, rather than the virus needing an acidic environment to trigger its entry [41, 67].

In the process of TGEV and PEDV entry into cells, the environmental conditions in the intestinal gut are complex and unfavorable. A thicker layer of mucus containing sialic acid covers the intestinal epithelium, and the small intestine generally has a low pH. In addition, the intestine is filled with proteases from the stomach and intestinal wall. These conditions make it hard for viruses to infect intestinal cells compared with infection of cultured cells. The selection of TGEV and PEDV RBDs interacting with cell surface receptors is the result of pressure from immune surveillance. Sialic acid usage by TGEV and PEDV promotes the efficient invasion into host cells. PEDV and TGEV invade enterocytes in the intestinal epithelium by exploiting proteases in the small intestine. TGEV induces PL1pro to hijack cellular canonical pathways to prevent viral protein degradation, facilitating later virus entry into targeted cells. TMPRSS2 and MSPL interact with the PEDV S protein to promote viral entry into cells by promoting cell-cell fusion and virus-cell fusion. Recently, porcine APN has been observed to function as a protease for PEDV, not as a receptor, to promote viral multiplication during PEDV entry into the cell, the mechanism of which requires further study. Low pH in the initial stage of PEDV entry into intestinal epithelial cells allows structural changes and protease activation during binding to surface receptors.",
