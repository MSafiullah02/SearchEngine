            "text": "During the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, a circular email challenged the governmental vaccination campaign against the pandemic strain. The email claimed that the pandemic vaccines Pandemrix and Focetria caused Gulf War Syndrome. The email\u2019s author, a general practitioner, blamed the adjuvant squalene of causing a number of heterogeneous symptoms, such as chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, headaches and attention deficiency disorder. In a very urgent tone, the author sketched a scenario in which the burden of disease due to the pandemic vaccine would dwarf the effects of the pandemic itself. The circular email spread swiftly and became famous at a national level in Germany. Simultaneously, print media reported about two different vaccines for different population groups. Due to contracts of the Ministry for Domestic Affairs (Innenministerium) the vaccine Celvapan from Baxter was provided exclusively to the armed forces (Bundeswehr) and members of government (Bundesregierung) (Hackenbroch and Traufetter, 2009: 141). The other vaccine, Pandemrix from GlaxoSmithKline, was meant for the general public and contained components whose side effects were fiercely debated. During the pandemic, coverage of vaccine-related topics and events was extensive. Especially, the organisation of the vaccination campaign, the topic of prioritisation of certain groups for vaccination and individual decisions concerning the vaccination by members of government were hotly debated (Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA), 2009: 11; Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung (FAS), 2009: 1; Hoischen, 2009: 3). This panoply of events together produced an atmosphere that was poorly conducive for the ongoing public health vaccination campaigns. Thus, public health authorities unanimously complained about what they termed a \u2018communication disaster\u2019 that had emerged simultaneously with the unfolding pandemic (Krause et al., 2010: 516).",

The National Pandemic Plan defines goals and their respective procedures, as well as responsibilities of actors within the state. The following four goals are identified: \u2018the reduction of morbidity and mortality within the population; ensuring treatment of sick persons; continuity of essential public services; timely provision of reliable information for policy makers, professionals, the public and the media\u2019 (GMK, 2016: 8).

Typically, operative responses to public health crises were evaluated positively, whereas communication efforts were seen as either lacking or failing. We take this juxtaposition of preparedness capabilities as an entry point to engage with public health communication. The narrative of the communication disaster hints at the projected ways in which information is circulated and the expected behaviour of the audiences of communication. Rather than discuss the outcome of the public health campaigns, we draw on Briggs and Hallin\u2019s (2016) concept of biocommunicability to analyse the conceptualisation and practice of public health communication.",

Practices and technologies of communication are central to the way that biomedicalised subjects and objects are represented and constructed. From their extensive material, the authors developed the concept of biocommunicability to describe the performative way by which health coverage not only imparts knowledge but also projects models about how phenomena come to be, how knowledge about them circulates and who should attend to them and how.",

The moment of \u2018problematization\u2019 describes how one actor defines a problem and a possible solution. \u2018Interessement\u2019 refers to the process by which the first actor interests others in the identities, roles and functions they would fulfil in the solution to the problem definition. \u2018Enrolment\u2019 occurs when the actors actually fulfil their designated roles and associate in order to achieve the common agenda. The moment of \u2018mobilisation\u2019 describes the actual mobilisation and exchange of things between associated actors that is necessary to stabilise the network (Callon, 1986). Important for our understanding of the concept of biocommunicability is that, similar moments are passed when one actor wants to convey health messages to an audience. Briggs and Hallin identified three models of biocommunicability that offer different problem definitions and solutions to how health should be communicated: the biomedical authority model, the patient\u2013consumer model, and the public sphere model.",

Knowledge production takes place in a supposedly objective, highly specialised and technical sphere. In contrast, other spheres are projected as being dominated by populist, relativist or democratic communication ideologies. Biomedical authorities fulfil the role of the sole reliable sources of health information. Journalists participate in this model by translating health knowledge into popular discourses. The lay public is projected as receiving this information passively. Importantly, due to the necessary process of translation, which is mainly undertaken by journalists who are not part of this elite community of biomedical professionals, health coverage is always perceived as a distortion of the actual information (Briggs and Hallin, 2016: 25\u201330).",

According to Briggs and Hallin (2010: 152) the patient\u2013consumer model is the most prevalent model in most areas of health communication. It aligns well with conceiving of health services as a market with active, information seeking, medically literate patients making their own independent decisions. In this configuration, the physician takes the role of an informed adviser who works together with her patient/client to find the best solution. As a necessary prerequisite, the client has to be imagined as endowed with sufficient financial resources (Briggs and Hallin, 2016: 33\u201339). Like in the biomedical authority model, biomedical professionals are the primary source of medical knowledge; but the patient\u2013consumer model projects the patient as an active seeker of information. Both models have in common that they define the function of health information in terms of how \u2018it helps the individuals to regulate their behavior in the interest of their own health\u2019 (Briggs and Hallin, 2010: 152).",

In this model, the audience is addressed as observer-citizen who has to make a judgement about collective decisions and social values. Rather than a linear flow of information from medical experts to a lay public, controversy is framed as conflict between different stakeholders or harmed citizens (Briggs and Hallin, 2016: 39\u201340).

While most participants referred to panic, fear and even hysteria simply as a reaction to the outbreak itself, some participants offered additional causes for the emotional state of the public. Among these causes, a lack of knowledge and media coverage were mentioned most frequently. For example, public health officer E who was involved in the first draft for a German pandemic response plan and was now coordinating pandemic response plans in a German federal state linked panic to rising case numbers. When we asked her to delineate the most important agencies within the federal state with whom she collaborated in pandemic planning she first mentioned the local and regional public health authorities and the politicians.

            "text": "In our interviews with health professionals both models, the biomedical authority model and the public sphere model are present. Sometimes they come into conflict with one another, especially when participants talked about the vaccination campaign during the pandemic. Public debate revolved around belonging to a certain social class symbolised either by receiving a vaccine deemed safer or being part of a prioritised group. In this context one of our participants framed communication in a way similar to what the National pandemic plan calls a \u2018hegemony of communication in public opinion\u2019 (RKI, 2016: 192\u2013193). Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe (2014 [1985]) have transferred the Gramscian notion of hegemony to the analysis of discourses. Hegemony as a discursive concept describes the prevalence of certain patterns of production of social meaning (Laclau and Mouffe, 2014 [1985]: 91). From this perspective the debate about the safety of the vaccine was organised around the category of trust in both its political and affective registers. Brown and Calnan (2010) make a similar observation regarding the pharmaceutical industry where the perceived safety of drugs is often linked to trust in the manufacturer. Perceiving the vaccine as safe was in the eyes of the public health officers as much a matter of the public\u2019s understanding of science as of its mistrust in the sources of the information. In terms of the actor network perspective of biocommunicability hegemony is achieved by one actor if the actors it wishes to enrol (e.g. journalists, the public) recognise the framing of the issue (health or politics) and fulfil the roles assigned to them in the communication of health information.",

(2011) blaming the media but also blaming dissenters for the low uptake of vaccination helped some of our participants to make sense of the \u2018communication disaster\u2019. Journalists are arguably the first audience when health authorities want to relay messages to the public. Framing the media as adversary rather than partner might impinge on the readiness to answer journalist\u2019s questions. One of our participants proposed to invite journalists to emergency exercises or meetings to discuss public health strategies with them. Briggs and Hallin (2016: 120\u2013124) emphasise the role that journalists\u2019 participation in exercises played for the production of the media coverage of the H1N1 pandemic within the first 24 hours of its detection. Their account sounds a note of caution in regard to how too much familiarity with exercises influences journalists to write stories about actual outbreaks that resemble the rehearsed scenario.",

            "text": "What is apparent from our findings is that health professionals underestimated the political register of the vaccination campaign. Coverage of issues of funding, prioritisation and safety of different vaccines followed the routines of political reporting opening the campaign to legitimate controversy. In addition, the dominance of the patient-consumer model might also complicate communication during a public health emergency. While outside of a crisis situation patients may actively seek information in order to maximise their health using all sources at their disposal, during the crisis public health authorities felt that they had to compete with these sources. In our interviews the one-voice policy emerged as a means to reduce the circulation of contradictory information from official sources. But this policy cannot (and should not) prevent controversy altogether. Our results as well as the recent debate about mandatory vaccination for measles for children in schools and nurseries suggest (e.g. Oltermann, 2019), that the struggle for hegemony with respect to vaccination campaigns in Germany, at least in part, seems to be centred on the question of whether vaccination is negotiated according to the rules of medical sciences or politics. If this is the case then it would be prudent to actively foster public debate about vaccination rather than waiting for the next pandemic to occasion the debate.",
