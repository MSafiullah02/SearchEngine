Wuhan is the biggest city in central China with a humid subtropical climate, an area of 8494 km 2 , and population of about 11 million. COVID-19 has been officially declared as a universal pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020 as it swept into more than 114 countries and killed more than 4000 person. Within one month from the declaration date, the confirmed cases and deaths have been dramatically increased and reached more than 1 million confirmed cases and more than 100000 deaths as reported by WHO on 10 April 2020. Within less than one month, the number of confirmed cases and deaths were duplicated; more than 2 million active cases and more than 200000 deaths were reported by WHO on 1 May 2020.

The spatial spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in China was statistically analyzed using Moran's I correlation algorithm . The reported data on platelet count in COVID-19 cases has been statistically analyzed to figure out its effect on mortality rate (Lippi et al., 2020) . Spatial effects of COVID-19 in China have been explored using the spatial panel models (Guliyev, 2020) . In another study, a conceptual model has been developed to model COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China considering some important factors of the 1918 influenza outbreak in London, United Kingdom .

The model consists of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system integrated with enhanced flower pollination algorithm and salp swarm algorithm.

The training subset is used to adjust the network based on its computed error. Validation subset is used to assess the generalization capability of the network. Test subset is used to assess the final performance of the network. Ten neurons were used in the hidden layer. The accumulated reported cases as well as the forecasted cases using ARIMA and NARANN are plotted in Figure 4 (a). An excellent agreement between NARANN and reported cases is observed, while ARIMA has failed to obtain accurate forecasted cases. Figure 4 (b) shows the absolute percentage error between the forecasted and reported cases for both models. The error of the results obtained by ARIMA model is increased with time, as it is 3.08% at the beginning (one day from the forecasting origin) and reaches a high value of 29.48% after ten days from the forecasting origin. On the other hand, the results of NARANN have small absolute percentage error (1.12%-4.89%) which fluctuates with time. It could be concluded that, NARANN could be used to forecast COVID-19 cases with a better accuracy compared with ARIMA. Therefore, NARANN will be consider in the two following forecasting process. In the third forecasting process, the NARANN succeed to forecast COVID-19 cases for long period (more than two weeks) as shown in Figure 7 in which a good agreement between the forecasted and reported cases is observed.",

If the data does not have a stationary nature, ARIMA performs d times data differencing to eliminate non-stationary of the data. The times of data differencing is defined as the ARIMA integration order. A typical ARIMA model consists of two main linear-regressions sub-models: the autoregression and the moving average.

This training algorithm has been reported as the fastest backpropagation training algorithm as it avoids the computation Hessian matrix that consumes large computational time. It depends on approximation of the second-order derivative.In this study, NARANN is used to model the accumulated COVID-19 confirmed cases time series in Egypt. The confirmed cases at time 1 t \uf02d defined as \uf028 \uf029 1 yt \uf02d is used as the input of the, while the output of the network is the confirmed cases at the next time \uf028 \uf029 yt.",

Evaluation criteria of the model Several statistical indices are employed to assess the performance and to ensure the reliability of the proposed models to forecast the COVID-19 cases. These indices analyze the errors between the reported and predicted cases and point out the accuracy of the models (Wu et al., 2020; Zaranezhad et al., 2019). The employed indicators are mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), determination coefficient R 2 , deviation ratio (RD), and coefficient of residual mass (CRM). Equations 5-9 correlate the mathematical formulas of these statistical indices (Essa et al..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026...

A good agreement is observed between reported confirmed cases and the training output. Also, the forecast region shown in this figure indicates the forecasted accumulated cases for one week after the collected data used in the training of the network. Upper and lower forecasting limits with 95% confidence limit are also plotted. For the first day of the forecast region (10 April), the number of forecasted cases is 1832 case with lower and upper limits of 1791 case and 1874 case, respectively. This forecasted value agrees with the accumulated confirmed cases reported by The Egyptian Ministry of Health (1794 case), which lies between the lower and upper forecasted limits. Within one week, the forecasted cases could reach a high value of 2566 case with lower and upper limits of 2119 case and 2966 case, respectively. Figure 5 (b) and (c) show the error and the error histogram between the reported confirmed cases and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the predicted cases, respectively.

Time series data has high variability and transient nature, which makes modeling of this type of data using linear models is a cumbersome problem(Chen et al., 2019).Thus, nonlinear approaches are highly recommended to model this kind of data(Gautam and Abhishekh, 2019).
