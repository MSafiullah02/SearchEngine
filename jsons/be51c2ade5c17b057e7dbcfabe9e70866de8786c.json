Previous studies illustrating the effects of oral colostrum (OC) have been confounded by the coincidence of enteral feedings. Objective To quantify OC absorption, as measured by urinary sIgA and lactoferrin, in preterm infants prior to enteral feedings. Materials and methods Colostrum was obtained from mothers delivering infants \u226432 weeks and \u22641500 g. sIgA and lactoferrin were measured in infant urine, and microflora in saliva and tracheal aspirates were characterized. Results Urinary sIgA and lactoferrin were significantly greater in infants receiving OC by syringe compared to swab (p < 0.002). Urinary sIgA correlated with the total number of doses in 72 h (R 2 = 43%, p < 0.01). Conclusions Administration of OC by syringe and higher cumulative dose are associated with increased absorption of sIgA and lactoferrin, and early dosing may contribute to a more diverse tracheal microbiome.",

Since early OC results in greater cumulative doses administered and, therefore, greater immune protein concentrations, it is necessary to further emphasize the importance of early milk expression to all staff. These findings support the idea that mothers of preterm infants face unique challenges to early milk production, likely related either to insufficient breast priming, stress, or medical diagnoses that contributed to preterm labor. Although there was staff education, more direct support from staff in Labor & Delivery and NICU is required. We now emphasize the importance of immediate postpartum milk expression during antenatal consultations for all mothers likely to deliver prematurely. We have empowered our staff to encourage transfer of any amount of milk to the NICU immediately after delivery.",

The change from swab to syringe OC was adopted throughout the NICU and observations were not concurrent, so they may be confounded by other alterations in practice. As all recruitment was done within a 2 year period, this effect is unlikely to be significant. The differences in retinopathy of prematurity, however, reflect the practice changes in monitoring oxygen satuartions during this time period. This study enrolled infants who were not ordered to receive enteral feedings until after 72 h. As this practice is contrary to our NICU guidelines of early enteral nutrition, it is likely that study infants were sicker than the usual preterm population, and provides a rationale for the observations of delays in time to full enteral feeding and the higher incidence of comorbidities.",
