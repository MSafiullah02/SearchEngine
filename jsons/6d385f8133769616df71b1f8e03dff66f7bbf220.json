            "text": "In an effort to mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19, many countries have imposed drastic lockdown, movement control or shelter in place orders on their residents. The effectiveness of these mitigation measures is highly dependent on cooperation and compliance of all members of society. The knowledge, attitudes and practices people hold toward the disease play an integral role in determining a society's readiness to accept behavioural change measures from health authorities. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge levels, attitudes and practices toward COVID-19 among the Malaysian public. A cross-sectional online survey of 4,850 Malaysian residents was conducted between 27th March and 3rd April 2020. The survey instrument consisted of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 3 items on attitudes and 3 items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 80.5%. Most participants held positive attitudes toward the successful control of COVID-19 (83.1%), the ability of Malaysia to conquer the disease (95.9%) and the way the Malaysian government was handling the crisis (89.9%). Most participants were also taking precautions such as avoiding crowds (83.4%) and practising proper hand hygiene (87.8%) in the week before the movement control order started. However, the wearing of face masks was less common (51.2%). This survey is among the first to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The results highlight the importance of consistent messaging from health authorities and the government as well as the need for tailored health education programs to improve levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices.",

A majority of these cases were traced back to a religious gathering which has now reached its fifth-generation infections [4] . The Malaysian Prime Minister has enforced a movement control order (MCO) on 18th March 2020 as a mitigation effort to reduce community spread and the overburdening of the country's health system. Similar to lockdowns in China and Italy, the MCO restricted most non-essential activity outside the home. Malaysians were only be permitted to leave the house for basic activities such as buying groceries and seeking medical treatment. The MCO also restricted Malaysians from leaving the country and all foreigners from entry. Non-essential sectors were ordered to close operations or allow employees to work from home.",

This becomes increasingly challenging with the vast amount of misinformation and disinformation shared on social media that is clouding people's understanding of COVID-19 [5] . When the initial MCO announcement was made, Malaysians reacted in panic and confusion. Aside from panic buying, people crowded public transportation hubs to travel back to their hometowns, potentially increasing the risk of infection to other parts of the country. While this reaction to the MCO was not unexpected, it raises questions regarding the level of understanding and attitudes toward COVID-19 among Malaysians.",

Assessing the KAP related to COVID-19 among the general public would be helpful to provide better insight to address poor knowledge about the disease and the development of preventive strategies and health promotion programs. Among the lessons learned from the SARS outbreak is that knowledge and attitudes are associated with levels of panic and emotion which could further complicate measures to contain the spread of the disease [6, 7] . The survey also gives a general picture of Malaysians COVID-19 prevention practices before the MCO and this can better prepare the government to address future health crises involving infectious diseases. The results of this study are important to inform future efforts focusing on societal readiness to comply with pandemic control measures.",

Members of the Malaysian public above the age of 18 and currently residing in the country were eligible to participate in the survey. We utilised several strategies to reach as many respondents as possible all over the country within the one-week data collection period. This includes relying on professional and personal networks of the researchers, reaching out to community leaders and social media influencers to broadcast and share the survey. Two main platforms used in disseminating this survey were social media (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) and WhatsApp. A standardised general description about the survey was given in the WhatsApp message/social media postings before the link was provided to both English and Malay language versions of the questionnaire.

The results showed that the Cronbach alpha for knowledge (13 items) was 0.655.

Almost half of the participants indicated that they did not wear a face mask when leaving the home in the week before the MCO. There are two possible explanations for this behaviour in the Malaysian context. Firstly, medical face masks (as well as hand sanitiser) had been in short supply since the beginning of the year when the first few COVID-19 cases were detected in the country. The scarcity of face masks meant that many regular members of the public were unable to obtain them, even if they wanted to. Secondly, the Ministry of Health Malaysia has been adamant that medical face masks should only be worn by those who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 or similar illnesses. This was to ensure ample supplies of personal protective equipment for medical workers on the frontline. Even so, mixed messages had been communicated to the public by different authoritative bodies on the use of face masks. It is possible that the lack of supply and the confusion caused by the mixed messages led to the divided response on the wearing of face masks when out in public.",
