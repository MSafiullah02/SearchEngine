            "text": "Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are non-enveloped, icosahedral, double-stranded DNA viruses ranging in size between 80 and 110 nm in diameter. Currently, all described human types are dispatched into 54 types representing seven species (A-G), which belong to the genus Mastadenovirus in the Adenoviridae family [1]. They are commonly responsible for a wide range of respiratory, gastrointestinal or ophthalmic illnesses. All HAdV types are excreted in very high numbers in faeces of infected people, regardless of the initial infection site [2]. Some HAdVs can establish long-lasting but indiscernible infections. As a result, the infected person sheds viruses unknowingly, and can then serve as a source of infection for other individuals [3]. After recovery from illness, HAdVs, especially the members of the HAdV-C species, may maintain latent persistent infections in the tonsils, the adenoids and other lymphoid tissues [4]. Some types (e.g., 1, 2, 3 and 5) are continuously present in the population. Most people have thus been exposed (primary infection) and at least 90% of the human population are positive to one or more HAdV antibodies [5, 6], even though no acute disease has been declared. On the contrary, HAdV infections (primary infections or reactivation of latent viruses) in immunocompromised people tend to become invasive, and the fatality rate may be as high as 50% [7]. After haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the immune system is weakened and many viruses are identified as a major risk for patients [8, 9]. HAdVs have therefore emerged as life-threatening agents in severely immunocompromised patients, such as haematopoietic stem cell recipients [10].",

Immuno-detection methods are of particular interest because they yield results quickly, despite their low sensitivity. They are generally used for screening HAdVs in stool samples or respiratory fluids from infected children, because these kinds of samples are heavily loaded with HAdV particles in the case of infection. The qPCR is considered to be a very sensitive, robust and fast technique. Recent European guidelines for diagnostis and treatment of adenovirus infection in stem cell transplantation (ECIL-4) recommend qPCR for monitoring HAdVs of high-risk patients [11], as previously suggested [12]. Using such a tool, an interest in screening HAdVs in stool samples instead of blood has been highlighted, because the HAdV viral load in stool samples precedes the presence of HAdVs in blood [13, 14].",

At this stage, DNA losses can occur, resulting in an under-estimation of HAdV concentration. Moreover, the presence of potential PCR inhibitors found in stool specimens (as lipids, polysaccharides and bile salts) can also perturb the qPCR reaction and lead to false-negative results [16].",

From the supernatant of stool samples, viral DNA was extracted by the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit and QIAamp DNA stool mini kit (Qiagen). The quantification of the adenovirus DNA was performed by a previously developed qPCR system using degenerated primers and a TaqMan probe [21]. The upstream and downstream primer sequences were 5\u2032-CWT ACA TGC ACA TCK CSG G-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CRC GGG CRA AYT GCA CCA G-3\u2032, respectively. The sequence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032) of the Ad(ACDEF) probe was 6FAM-CCG GGC TCA GGT ACT CCG AGG CGT CCT-BHQ1. The detection of qPCR inhibitors in DNA extract from stools was performed by adding the equivalent of 105 copies/reaction of HAdV-2 DNA in extracted DNA from a non-spiked stool sample. The detected concentrations in a stool sample (Cstool) were compared with concentrations obtained for the same HAdV-2 DNA concentration in water (Cpur DNA). The potential inhibition was expressed as a percentage and calculated as follows: 100 \u2212 [(Cstool \u00d7 100)/Cpur DNA].",

In stool samples, iPCR and sandwich ELISA exhibit similar recovery rates, which are considered as high.

The unrecovered viruses are either sequestered in stools [22] or not detected due to interference occurring at the immuno-detection stage.

Our results show that a maximum of 9.5% of spiked HAdVs in stool samples were detectable using direct qPCR, while the detection rate of iPCR can reach 59%. Important DNA losses occurring during the nucleic acids extraction step can certainly explain these findings. A study shows that only 0.1% of spiked HAdV-2 in stool samples is detected by qPCR, regardless of the extraction kit used [15]. The results of the latter study highlighted a considerable loss of DNA equal to or higher than 3 log10 using three different extraction kits, including the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit. The amplification reaction can also be hindered by some interfering components. Two studies on extraction and detection of coronaviruses in stools demonstrated that PCR inhibitors present in nucleic acid extracts could interfere with the performance of the qPCR [28, 29].

The developed technique is powerful and allows detection of small amounts of HAdV particles in stool samples. To our knowledge this is the first description of iPCR for HAdVs. It improves our ability to decrease the detection limit of HAdVs in complex biological matrices and thus avoid the underestimation of viral concentrations. Its ability can be particularly interesting for the early detection of HAdVs in immuno-compromised patients. An early detection of HAdVs in stools should allow the rapid implementation of treatments using antivirals or adoptive immunotherapy to prevent the dissemination of the infection.",
