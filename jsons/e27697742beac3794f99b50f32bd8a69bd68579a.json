            "text": "Main findings Dudas G, et al. 2018 Based on existing MERS-CoV sequence data to examine the phylo-dynamics in camels and humans with structured coalescent model, Dudas et al show that long-term evolution of MERS-CoV occurs exclusively in camels while humans serve as a transient and terminal host ultimately. In addition, the study has shown that human outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula have been driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels. Kasem S, et al. 2017 An investigation of animal herds associated with MERS-infected patients in Saudi Arabia, during 2014-2016. Seventy-five dromedary camels positive for MERS-CoV RNA; the virus was not detected in sheep, goats, and cattle. MERS-CoV RNA from infected camels was not detected beyond 2 weeks after the first positive result was detected in nasal swabs obtained from infected camels. Anti-MERS ELISA assays showed that 70.9% of camels related to human cases had antibodies to MERS-CoV. The full genome sequences of the ten MERS-CoV camel isolates were identical to their corresponding patients and were grouped together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster for human and camel isolates reported form the Arabian Peninsula. Lau SK, et al. 2017 219 camel and human MERS-CoV genome sequences available in GenBank were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 5 and 214 strains belong to clade A and B, respectively, with clade A further divided into lineage A1 (3 human strains) and lineage A2 (2 camel strains), and clade B divided into B1 to B6 (each containing both human and camel strains). Recombination analysis showed potential recombination events in five strains from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia, with recombination between lineage B5 and B3 in four strains, and between lineage B3 and B4 in one strain. The spike protein showed the highest number of amino acid substitutions, especially between A2 and other lineages, and contained positively selected codons. Notably, codon 1020 was positively selected among B and B5 strains, and can distinguish between clade A (Q1020) and B (R1020/H1020) strains, suggesting that this residue may play a role in the evolution of S protein during divergence of different lineages. The time of the most recent common ancestor of all MERS-CoV was dated to approximately 2010. Muhairi SA, et al. 2016 Nasal swabs from 1113 dromedary camels (39 farms) and 34 sheep (1 farm) and sputum samples from 2 MERS-CoV infected camel farm owners and 1 MERS-CoV-infected sheep farm owner were collected in Abu Dhabi. Samples from camels and humans underwent real-time quantitative RT-PCR screening to detect MERS-CoV. In addition, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partially characterize MERS-CoV genome fragments obtained from camels were performed. Among the 40 farms, 6 camel farms were positive for MERS-CoV; the virus was not detected in the single sheep farm. The maximum duration of viral shedding from infected camels was 2 weeks after the first positive test result as detected in nasal swabs and in rectal swabs obtained from infected calves. Three partial camel sequences characterized in this study (ORF 1a and 1ab, Spike1, Spike2, and ORF4b) together with the corresponding regions of previously reported MERS-CoV sequence obtained from one farm owner were clustering together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster containing human and camel isolates reported for the Arabian Peninsula. Farag EA, et al. 2015 A high proportion of camels presenting for slaughter in Qatar showed evidence for nasal MERS-CoV shedding (62/105). Sequence analysis showed the circulation of at least five different virus strains at these premises, suggesting that this location is a driver of MERS-CoV circulation and a high-risk area for human exposure. No correlation between RNA loads and levels of neutralizing antibodies was observed, suggesting limited immune protection and potential for reinfection despite previous exposure.",
