The first cases occurred in early December, 2019, and, by 29 January 2020, more than 7000 cases had been reported in China [1]. Early reports advise that COVID-19 transmission may occur from an infectious individual, who is not yet symptomatic [2]. Evidently, such asymptomatic infectious cases are not reported to medical authorities. For epidemic influenza outbreaks, reported cases are typically only a fraction of the total number of the symptomatic infectious individuals. For the current epidemic in Wuhan, it is likely that intensive efforts by Chinese public health authorities have reduced the number of unreported cases.",

For this epidemic, a modeling approach has been developed in [3], which did not consider unreported cases. Our work continues the investigation in [4,5] of the fundamental problem of parameter identification in mathematical epidemic models. We address the following fundamental issues concerning this epidemic: How will the epidemic evolve in Wuhan with respect to the number of reported cases and unreported cases? How will the number of unreported cases influence the severity of the epidemic? How will public health measures, such as isolation, quarantine, and public closings, mitigate the final size of the epidemic?",

Our goal is to identify them from specific time data of reported symptomatic infectious cases. To identify the unreported asymptomatic infectious cases, we assume that the cumulative reported symptomatic infectious cases at time t consist of a constant fraction along time of the total number of symptomatic infectious cases up to time t. In other words, we assume that the removal rate \u03bd takes the following form: \u03bd=\u03bd1+\u03bd2, where \u03bd1 is the removal rate of reported symptomatic infectious individuals, and \u03bd2 is the removal rate of unreported symptomatic infectious individuals due to all other causes, such as mild symptom, or other reasons.",

In (c), we use \u03c71=0.36, \u03c72=0.28, \u03c73=0.1, and t0=\u22124.52 for the parameter values obtained from the data for Wuhan, which give \u03c4=3.6\u00d710\u221208 for t\u2208[t0,25] and \u03c4=0 for t>25, I0=0.25, U0=0.02. The cumulated number of reported cases goes up to 7000 in (b), 4000 in (b) and 1400 in (c), and the turning point is around 30 January in (a\u2013c).",
