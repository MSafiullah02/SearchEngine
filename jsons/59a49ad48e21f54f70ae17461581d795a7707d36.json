Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FITR), TA instruments and zeta potentiometer analyzer were used to characterize the parameters with respect to size, thermal characters, morphology, and zeta potential of the microspheres. The loading capability and in vitro release tests were carried out. The results showed that chitosan microsphere with particle size less than 10 \u03bcm and positively charged (+25.97\u00b10.56 mV) can be obtained under the aldehyde group to amino group ratio at 1:1. A loading capacity of BSA at 28.63\u00b10.15 g/100 g with corresponding loading effi ciency at 72.01\u00b11.44% was obtained for chitosan microsphere. In vitro test revealed a burst release followed by sustained-release profi le.",

The residue drugs on the surface of these microcapsules may account for the burst-release stages. Another type of sustained-release drug delivery system (DDS) is that the objective molecules were absorbed onto the surfaces of the microcapsules by electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonds. The common used polymers in this system include poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(D,Llactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) [1] , zein [2] , chitosan, and so on. All these substances have the advantages of good biodegradability and biocompatibilities. However, PLA or PLGA may undergo bulk erosion in vivo that produces a very low pH environment within these matrices, which may adversely affect sensitive therapeutic agents such as proteins. Zein is a natural polymer, which has many advantages as carrier for DDS [2] , but these protein suffers from its sources, as the extraction of zein from corn is a laborious process [3] .",

This polysaccharide has such features as non-toxic, biodegradable, and biocompatibility, which is obtained from deacetylation of chitin, and is a linear chain polysaccharide formed through the linkage of \u03b1-amino-D-glucosamine by \u03b2-1,4-glucosidic bond. Chitosan with high molecular weight is insoluble in water and organic solvents, but can dissolve in weak acids by converting the glucosamine units into R-NH 3 + [4, 5] . As many amino and hydroxyl groups distributed on the chains of chitosan molecules, the inner-or inter-hydrogen bonds can be formed. Chitosan has many bioactivities such as immunity, antibiosis, and wound healing, and has been used in waste water disposal [6] [7] [8] , food industry, spinning, chemical industry, bioengineering, drug delivery system [4, [9] [10] [11] and tissue engineering [12] as a kind of functional polymer. Chitosan has also been used in agriculture as sustained-release carrier for fertilizer in the form of microparticles [13] . Chitosan has been used not only in the natural form, but also in the form of microcapsule, as microcapsule can be used as carriers for sustained release of drugs or other active molecules. The aim of this paper is to use chitosan microsphere adsorping BSA as model in DDS.",

In addition, the modifi ed chitosan hydrogel with pH-sensitive characteristics has also been developed for controlling the release of protein molecules [23, 29, 30] . In the protein delivery system, bovine serum albumin (BSA) is the most frequently used model protein molecules [19, 30, 31] . Recently, the chitosan-BSA system has been designed as model for isolation of protein from the solution as this system does not change the secondary or tertiary structure of the protein molecules [32] . The sustained-or targetted-drug delivery system based on chitosan and other polymers such as alginate and pectin has also been attempted [22, 25, 28, [33] [34] [35] [36] . However, less study has been conducted on the relationship between the combining ways of the BSA on chitosan microspheres and their relationship to the loading capacity and in vitro release profi le. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to elucidate the relationship between the surface features of chitosan microspheres and their loading capacity to BSA. The possible absorptive mechanisms of chitosan microsphere were indicated.",

The optimal aldehyde to amino ratio is 1:1 for the preparation of blank microsphere in terms of appearance and uniformity (Fig.1) . When the aldehyde/amino ratio increased to 20:1, the chitosan microspheres sticked to each other, which is not expected as it is assumed that higher content of aldehydes may cause the amino groups to crosslink more thoroughly, thus become more regular in the appearance of the microsphere. High aldehyde/amino ratio need less time to form microspheres due to the increased cross-linking rate. So under the same crosslinking time, the whole microspheres which had formed in the high aldehyde/amino ratio reaction system were broken into pieces under the shearing force of solution.",

The significant higher TG 50 of chitosan microspheres compared with that of chitosan powder indicates the amino groups of chitosan have been crosslinked by the aldehyde groups. In addition, chitosan microsphere bearing BSA has highest TG 50 , which also indicated that in the adsorption process, the BSA molecules acts not only as the objective molecules, but also act as partial crosslinking effects.",

The linear equation is y=1.6229x-0.0035, R=0.9999. To ensure that the absorbed BSA released completely from the chitosan microsphere, the loaded microspheres were dissolved in hydrochloric acid at pH 2. After 2 h of incubation, the chitosan microparticles were found to be completely disintegrated and the BSA in the suspension could be determined for loading effi ciency and loading capacity. A loading capacity 28.63\u00b10.15 g/100 g with corresponding loading efficiency at 72.01\u00b11.44% was obtained for chitosan microsphere, which reached the highest encapsulation efficiency of chitosan/TPP nanoparticles as prepared by Yang et al [15] . However, this value is lower than the proteinloaded chitosan microspheres which is prepared by a modified ionotropic gelation method combined with a high voltage electrostatic field which showed prospective method for the preparation of proteindelivery system [21] . Fig.4 showed an obvious burst release was observed for chitosan microspheres which is common to many micxroparticles-based drug delivery systems [26, 31] . For the fi rst 4 hours, about (32.4\u00b13.81)% BSA released from chitosan microspheres. At 240 h, about 70% BSA released for the microspheres. The release profiles may be closely related to the ways of the interactions between BSA molecules and chitosan microspheres. BSA molecules, when absorbed onto the surfaces of chitosan microspheres may released quickly, which constitutes the burst effects of the delivery systems, when the BSA molecules entered into the valleys of the coarse surfaces of the chitosan microspheres, the BSA molecules may acted as partial crosslinkers and released very slowly until the microspheres disintegrated, these may explain the sustained release profile of chitosan microspheres. In our another study [17] , the chitosan microspheres showed signifi cantly higher loading capacity for bovine coronavirus N protein than that for BSA. It is supposed that this may be caused by different isoelectric points of these proteins. As the pH 5.8 solution was used for adsorption of the different proteins by chitosan microspheres, that is, the larger distance between pH 5.8 and isoelectric points of the protein, the more electric charges carried by the protein molecules, and thus the more attrctive interactions between chitosan microspheres and protein molecules. Ma and Liu [21] prepared the BSA-loaded chitosan microspheres by ionotropic gelation using TPP and ethanol as solvents under a high voltage, the microspheres developed from different concentrations of coagulation solution showed pH-dependent release profi les.",
