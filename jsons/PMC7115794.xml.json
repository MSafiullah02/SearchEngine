In accordance with the Kyoto Protocol, which is the international treaty to mitigate global warming, each country is required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions down to 1990 levels. As energy consumption is the main source of carbon dioxide emissions, the energy efficiency issue has been addressed by both developed and developing economies.",

            "text": "Because Taiwan is a small open and developing economy, it relies heavily on overseas supplies for its energy needs, and as a result the international economic environment has continuously impacted the country's energy prices. For example, in 2010 the percentage of Taiwan's imported energy accounted for 99.4% of total energy supplies, in contrast to 0.6% of indigenous energy, with total energy supplies in Taiwan hitting 145,561 thousands of kiloliter of oil equivalent (KLOE). In the same year, Taiwan's total energy domestic consumption achieved a record high of 120,308 thousands of KLOE (Energy Statistics, 2012). Saving energy has thus become an extremely important issue in Taiwan, with existing research studies addressing energy efficiency or productivity on the region level or country level (for example Bian and Yang, 2010, Greening et al., 1997, Guo et al., 2011, Honma and Hu, 2008, et al.,, Howarth et al., 1991, Hu and Kao, 2007, Shi et al., 2010, Worrell et al., 1997). Some researches focused on the fossil fuel power plants with considering the undesirable outputs (Sueyoshi and Goto, 2012). Furthermore, the capital\u2013labor ratio as the proxy of technology level is one of the important indicators in the energy economics. Wu (2012) proposed that the capital\u2013labor ratio reduces inefficient energy use, because new capital utilizes energy-saving technology. However, Blomberg et al. (2012) indicated that even bigger companies with high capital in Sweden might have challenges to improving energy efficiency because of possible risks for production disruptions and the associated costs. However, there is a paucity of research investigating the energy issue in the service sectors as well as the impact of the capital\u2013labor ratio toward the energy efficiency even though the relative share of services in total gross domestic production (GDP) has been increasing and accounts for nearly 70% in Taiwan. Especially, the growth rate of energy consumption in the service sectors from 2001 to 2008 is 20.44% in contrast to the 19.67% as of the industrial sectors in Taiwan. Hence, this paper's objective is to bridge the gap in the literature by measuring the energy efficiency for different subsectors under the service aggregation sectors in Taiwan and to validate the hypothesis of the impact of capital\u2013labor ratio on the energy efficiency in the service sectors.",

Their paper employed data envelopment analysis (DEA), using labor, capital stock, energy consumption, and total sown area of farm crops as the four inputs and real GDP as the single output in order to find the target energy input of each region in China for each particular year. A U-shape relation between an area's TFEE and per capita income in the areas of China empirically confirms the scenario that energy efficiency eventually improves with economic growth.",

Gouyette and Perelman (1997) took input-oriented DEA and the Malmquist index, including GDP as the single output and labor and capital inventory as two inputs, to measure efficiency and productivity of the manufacturing and service sectors for 13 OECD countries over the 1970\u20131987 period. The results indicate that the productivity of the service sectors in OECD countries slightly increased, which is mostly caused by an increase in efficiency change. Boyd and Pang (2000) examined the differences in plant-level electricity and fossil fuel intensity in the glass industry. Productivity differences between plants are statistically significant in explaining differences in plant energy intensity. Productivity has a significantly positive impact on the energy efficiency for flat glass, but not for container glass.",

The empirical result presents that the TFEE is relatively higher in the mining, general machinery, real estate and housing service, and the financial and insurance and service sectors in Japan, in contrast to the relatively lower energy intensity for the agricultural sector, as well as the transportation and communication sector. Honma and Hu (2011) further computed and analyzed the TFEE of 11 industries in 14 developed countries during 1995\u20132005 using the DEA approach and by considering four inputs (labor, capital stock, intermediate inputs other than energy, and energy) and one output (the value added). The most inefficient industry is the metal industry, with an average TFEE of 40.6%. The results also identify the most efficient countries in each different time period of 1995\u20131998, 1999\u20132002, and 2003\u20132005. Shi et al.

EI stands for the energy consumption for producing every unit of real GDP within a certain time frame.

Another critic noted that this partial factor index is inappropriate for investigating the impact of changing energy use over time (Asia Pacific Energy Research Center (APERC), 2002). Hence, the objective of this paper is three-fold. First, this paper analyzes the pure technical efficiency (PTE) and assesses the energy-saving target of Taiwan's service sectors by employing VRS\u2013DEA. Second, the paper computes the energy-saving target ratio and TFEE for each service subsector developed by Hu and Wang (2006). Third, this study further investigates the effects of industry characteristics on the energy-saving target by applying the four-stage DEA proposed by Fried et al. (1999). We also calculate the pre-adjusted and environment-adjusted total-factor energy efficiency (TFEE) scores in these service sectors.",

The financial service sector has the highest TFEE among the service sectors herein. Particularly, energy in the financial service sector might be consumed less than in the other service sectors. Honma and Hu (2013) also indicated that the financial and insurance sector has the high level TFEE in Japan. They pointed out that the tertiary industries, except for the transportation and communication sector, have higher TFEE scores in Japan, which is consistent with this paper's finding. The government needs to develop financial service businesses to yield a relatively higher GDP under the given labor and energy. Weber (2005) further indicated that banks have pursued cost saving effects by reducing their consumption of energy, water, and resource materials. Banks also have demonstrated their environmental strategy of \u2018going for green\u2019 to attract more customers. The TFEE in the wholesale and retail trade sector dramatically increases to a record high in 2008. The 3R (recycling, reuse, and refill) policy in Taiwan has resulted in obvious progress in the wholesale and retail trade sector. The popular recycle containers in hypermarkets have helped promote the concept of energy conservation, while the severe price-cutting competition among wholesalers and retailers in Taiwan have also indirectly had a positive impact on the energy-saving action.",

This may be because more high-tech service industries in Taiwan use more energy-consuming facilities that are not so energy-efficient. Blomberg et al. (2012) also indicate that even bigger companies in Sweden may face significant barriers to improving energy efficiency because of possible risks for production disruptions and the associated costs. Meanwhile, the medium sized companies also have the lower priority to increase the capital turnover in order to address on the energy efficiency issue (Blomberg et al., 2012). Therefore, the service industries in Taiwan should pay attention to energy efficiency of newly acquired facilities.

In fact, Taiwan's indigenous energy supply has fallen so much that it has only accounted for less than 1% of total energy supply since 2003 (Energy Statistics, Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs) in contrast to more than 99% of energy supply being imported. Policy makers should pay more attention to those service sectors with poor energy efficiency. For example, the Taiwan Tourism Bureau (TTB) could offer incentives for green hotels or green restaurants in order to improve energy efficiency in the catering and lodging sector. The TTB could further combine \u2018green\u2019 criteria into the on-going hotel star-rating system. Taiwan's government should encourage restaurateurs to measure, list, and mitigate their carbon footprint on each menu item. Even though Taiwan government alleges main six promotions for energy saving: \u201c(1) Promote energy saving light bulb; (2) Apply thermostat timer on water dispenser and water fountain machine; (3) Set up one degree more for the temperature in summer time and clean the filter; (4) Be sure to power off the computer, instead of idling for a while; (5) Promote unplugging the electric appliance; (6) Promote turning off the light for an hour during lunch break for governmental and regular business office buildings (Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs),\u201d offering financial incentives to use solar water heaters, green furniture, and other energy-saving equipment in the service sectors could also enhance energy efficiency through electricity, gas, and other energy-saving plans.",
