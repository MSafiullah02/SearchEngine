Influenza is a frequent cause of upper respiratory infections in NHs and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.21 Prevention through a rigorous vaccination program can significantly reduce a NH\u2019s likelihood of experiencing an outbreak. In recent years, widespread communication regarding influenza prevention such during the 2009 H1N1 in pandemic and the 2003-2004 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome has also increased the awareness for NHs to prevent influenza outbreaks from occurring.22 Although significant variability exists, an increased number of NH residents now receive the influenza vaccination.10, 23 This likely can partially be attributed to the inclusion of influenza vaccination as a quality measure.

It is possible that infection control training focuses more on the prevention, control, and epidemiology of resident care management and less on the quality improvement strategies methodology. The quality measures that reflect the long-term effects of IP basic training have not been elucidated. When the Department of Health and Human Services plan begins to be implemented however, IPs will be the individuals to gather the surveillance data and enter it into National Healthcare Safety Network and to initiate any prevention modalities to prevent and/or reduce these infections. The future, therefore, may find that having IPs who have received basic training in infection prevention and control programs will significantly impact current and future quality indicators. Whereas many NHs may have IPs functioning in multiple roles (such as that of the director of nursing, charge nurse, or in-service nurse),9 we did not account for this in the analysis. In Maryland data, there were no IPs who performed their infection prevention and control job full-time. Of the 123 responding facilities, the IPs performed at least 1 other function and usually 3 or 4.",

Previous research has cited that, whereas infections are extremely common, outbreaks are reported less often than less frequently occurring events such as abuse.32 This study identified that NHs with greater FTE support of an IP resulted in better outcomes in some areas. Thus, further research in the role of reporting outbreaks and quality improvement strategies to prevent and track infections in NHs is critical, especially in NHs where minimal support is provided. For example, in the aftermath of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care provided funding to increase IPs in long-term care homes to prevent and better manage future outbreaks of HAIs.33 Future research examining the cost of IPs and the effectiveness and proper staffing levels for the IP is needed for policy to further guide clinical care.",
