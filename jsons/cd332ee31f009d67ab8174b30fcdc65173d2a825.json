Household registered population, i.e., people with Hukou, for each city was taken from the same book. Permanent resident population for province and the proportion of urban population was taken from China Statistical Abstract 2016 2 . Permanent resident population refers to people who stay in a city for more than half of the year, which include both people who registered with the city and people who registered in other cities. Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing are four municipalities directly under the central government. They are considered as province-level cities. We explained in panel 2 that cities in China include both urban and rural parts. Here populations for the entire city and for urban districts under the city were reported for each prefecture-level city. For county-level city, the total population was reported. The proportion of urban population in permanent resident population was only reported at the province level. In order to learn what have been done by cities in China in building healthy cities, we worked with the National Patriotic Health Campaign Committee (NPHCC) Office in National Health and Family Planning Commission to conduct a mail-in survey between February and March in 2017. NPHCC Office helped us to invite any cities that are working to become healthy cities to participate in the survey voluntarily. We developed a questionnaire with open questions to ask cities to report their actions in five aspects and any innovations in building healthy cities.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Appendix 1 Targets included in the Healthy China 2030 plan"}, {"text": "\u2022 Environmental management", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Appendix 1 Targets included in the Healthy China 2030 plan"}, {"text": "\u2022 Health services", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Appendix 1 Targets included in the Healthy China 2030 plan"}, {"text": "\u2022 Social services", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "\u2022 Prevention and control of diseases"}, {"text": "\u2022 Actions to increase public participation", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "\u2022 Prevention and control of diseases"}, {"text": "In total, we received responses from 36 cities, including 14 cities that have been included in the first batch of 38 cities in the national pilot program (Table 1) .

We collected daily index data on HFMD related keywords (in Chinese) in Chengdu from May 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. Thirty-eight keywords involving symptoms, transmission and treatments were collected. Daily aggregated counts of HFMD cases from 2013 to 2016 in Chengdu, China were obtained from CDC-Sichuan. No personal information was revealed. Both health data and index data were aggregated by week in this study.In this study, we built a composite index.where represents the composite index of the first j keywords, is a single keyword, is the weight of , that is determined by its cross-correlation with counts of HFMD cases,where HFMD is weekly counts of HFMD cases, \u03b5 denotes residual term.HFMD related keywords were sorted according to their cross-correlation with the counts of HFMD cases.
