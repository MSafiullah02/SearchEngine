The underlying mechanism of action of ECP in GVHD is not completely understood 9, 10. Within 24 hours, this process induces apoptosis of all treated cells (including T cells) and subsequent phagocytosis by antigen-presenting cells; as a result, this might regulate immune homoeostasis, modulate the cytokine production, and induce tolerance of antigen-presenting cells 10, 11, 12, 13.",

The last follow-up was fixed on June 2014. In detail, 21 patients were treated with ECP for aGVHD refractory to steroids, which was defined as a progression or no improvement in aGVHD after at least 3 days or 7 days on methylprednisolone (MP) \u2265 2 mg/kg body weight, respectively (SR group); 21 patients for steroid-dependant aGVHD, defined as a flare-up of aGVHD during the tapering of MP (SD group); and 30 children with aGVHD who required a reduction of pharmacological IS or contraindications to IS therapy for viral reactivations, systemic mycoses, or intolerable side effects (group with infectious complications [IC]). In particular, 9 of 30 patients in the IC group (IC-A group) underwent ECP without steroids as a first-line therapy because of contraindications: 1 for TCR \u03b1\u03b2 and CD19\u2013depleted haploidentical transplantation with probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and adenovirus (ADV), 1 for proven IPA, 1 for concomitant proved IPA and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation, 1 for probable IPA and CMV and BK virus (BKV) reactivations, 1 for proven IPA and multiple viral reactivations, including ADV, CMV, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 2 for CMV reactivation, 1 for CMV and EBV reactivations, and 1 for CMV, EBV, ADV, and BKV reactivations. The other 21 patients (IC-B group) had SD aGVHD and cyclosporin A (CsA)\u2013related renal insufficiency in only 1 patient; SD aGVHD and concomitant infections in the remaining 20 patients: CMV reactivations, 2; CMV and EBV reactivations, 4; CMV and BKV reactivations, 2; CMV, ADV, and BKV reactivations, 1; EBV reactivations, 4; EBV and ADV reactivations, 1; EBV reactivations and probable aspergillosis, 1; hepatitis B virus, 1; hepatitis B virus and EBV reactivations, 1; CMV, EBV, and BKV reactivations, 1; ADV, human herpesvirus-6, BKV, and coronavirus, 1; hepatitis C virus, CMV, and proven IPA, n = 1.",

Viral reactivations were detected by PCR positivity for EBV-DNA (cut-off: 1000 copies/mL), CMV-DNA (cut-off: 1000 copies/mL), and ADV-DNA in qualitative test. Clinical systemic fungal infections were defined proved or probable according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria [21].

We attempted to determine the factors that may have influenced our observed higher response. In the last 15 years, many changes have been introduced in HSCT, such as high-resolution HLA typing, new agents in the conditioning regimen, more use of ATG, monoclonal antibodies, and new antifungal drugs. It is difficult to determine which modification may have influenced the outcome. We could also hypothesize that specific expertise in pediatric HSCT and earlier treatment with ECP (22 days in our series versus 30 days in AEIOP study) may have improved the overall outcome. Further studies are needed to address this topic.",

Our results showed better response rate than those reported in literature for advanced stages of disease, where higher grades and poorer response to IS therapy correlate with a worst outcome [6]. Nevertheless, higher CR rates were observed in grade II GVHD, suggesting that an early start of ECP sessions may be beneficial, even if in our study the timing to start ECP (<22 versus > 22 days) did not influence the response. In our group, ECP seemed to be effective in all the involved organs. As previously reported, our results support that ECP is a steroid-sparing treatment; in fact, the steroid dose was reduced by 80%, 84%, and 88% after 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively from the onset of ECP. We performed ECP as front-line therapy in 8 patients with fungal infection and viral reactivation and aGVHD, with complete response in 7 of them. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ECP as first-line treatment. IS therapy was either discontinued or reduced in 78% of responding patients. It is well known from the literature that IS therapy increases the risk of infectious complications and relapse of underlying disease after allo-HSCT 1, 2, 18, 20, 28, 35.",

In children with low body weight, the caregivers should carefully monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypovolemia. In our experience, ECP was well tolerated, with few and mild adverse effects, the most frequent of which were mild hypotension, abdominal pain, and headache. Curiously, these symptoms were recorded more often during ECP compared with other apheretic procedures 19, 34. The majority of side effects were observed in the earliest period in which ECP was performed in our center. All these observations support the idea that there has been a learning process for the management of technical elements and side effects. In our experience, ECP was feasible even in 15 very young children with low body weight (<15 kg). Technically, we performed priming of the circuit with irradiated and leukodepleted red blood cells (regardless of baseline hemoglobin level). Some authors recently reported that saline infusion or albumin boluses may be an alternative priming approach in patients with body weight ranging from 19 to 39 kg [36]. However, it should be proven that this approach could be safely transferred to population weighting less than 15 kg. Currently used ECP techniques include the \u201coff-line\u201d and the \u201cin-line\u201d devices [19]. In our center, both techniques were used in different time periods with no difference in response rate observed. The number of WBC collected and MNC reinfused did not affect clinical outcome. Notably, all patients underwent the procedure with the bilumen central venous line already in place (Hickman-Broviac Bard Access Systems, Salt Lake City, UT, USA), which is different from the majority of reports, in which a larger central venous line (for instance, quinton) is placed. It would be interesting to extend our experience to determine if urokinase anticoagulation allows the proper flow rate of pre-existing central venous line. Further, because of the experience of the staff in completing the procedure, no patient required sedation.",
