These cells are usually transported fresh after collection by individual or commercial couriers, while cord blood cells are transported while frozen though they still must be delivered promptly. In addition to transportation difficulties, possible exposures of the donor may affect the safety of the stem cell product. It is currently uncertain whether COVID-19 is transmissible parenterally, but it seems prudent to defer donors from endemic areas until suitable testing and observation time can ensure the safety of the product. This is particularly important if the donor is in a country or region with a high rate of COVID-19 infection. Donation may be precluded by available health resources diverted to the infection, perceived risks to couriers and the consequent delays in exporting and importing the product.",

Timely communication to donors and patients with strategies to assist in the provision of alternative products and procedures to optimize cell collections may be required. Pre-emptive cryopreservation of products that are likely to be required at a time when transport may be further restricted is one option. This would allow complete infectious testing to ensure that the product is not contaminated by infectious agents before use.",
