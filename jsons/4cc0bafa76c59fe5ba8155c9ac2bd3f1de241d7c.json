In fact, psychological and behavioral countermeasures of both the individual and the community are vital determinants to improve resilience and enhance the efficacy of public health approaches vis a vis a pandemic of a magnitude similar to that of COVID-19 [4] . The nutritional status of individuals has for long been considered as an indicator of resilience against destabilization [5] . The ecology of adversity and resilience demonstrates that substantial stressors, such as inadequate nutrition, can lead to long-lasting effects that are linked to health [6] .

In fact, existing evidence highlights that diet has a profound effect on people's immune system and disease susceptibility. It has been demonstrated that specific nutrients or nutrient combinations may affect the immune system through the activation of cells, modification in the production of signaling molecules, and gene expression [9] . Furthermore, dietary ingredients are significant determinants of gut microbial composition and consequently can shape the characteristics of immune responses in the body [10] . Nutritional deficiencies of energy, protein, and specific micronutrients are associated with depressed immune function and increased susceptibility to infection. An adequate intake of iron, zinc, and vitamins A, E, B6, and B12 is predominantly vital for the maintenance of immune function [11] . Therefore, the key to maintaining an effective immune system is to avoid deficiencies of the nutrients that play an essential role in immune cell triggering, interaction, differentiation, or functional expression.",

First, the state of lockdown announced in many countries around the globe led all public and private sector institutions, with the exception of health care facilities and a limited number of essential services, to close down and, if possible, carry its operations remotely (without face to face interactions). Individuals were asked to stay home and avoid contact with other people [12] . Such measures of self-isolation and social distancing are known to be crucial in limiting the spread of the virus, flattening the curve of incidence rate, and ultimately disease containment [13] . These measures have severe repercussions on both food access and utilization. Food access, however, is dependent on factors that could reach beyond the individual and are more directly related to actions and policies at the community, national as well as global levels. That said, the individual remains capable of making a few choices related to food utilization. The confinement to one's home has direct effects on one's lifestyle, including dietary habits, eating, and physical activity patterns. Confinement increases sedentary behaviors that involve activities with very low energy expenditure, performed mainly in a sitting or supine position [14] . The low physical activity levels, even for short periods, could negatively affect physical and mental health. The state of lockdown and confinement could also lead to irregular eating patterns and frequent snacking, both of which are associated with higher caloric intake and increased risk of obesity [15] .",

Furthermore, emotions like fear and sadness are associated with less desire or motivation to eat and with lessened enjoyment during eating [17] . More recently, in explicating a five-way model of emotions and diet, it was found that changes in food intake may be the \"natural\" response to stress and heightened emotional states through both psychological and physiological mechanisms [18] .",

In addition to taking care of one's dietary intake, the collective responsibility of individuals is to avoid the spread of misinformation related to nutrition and dietary intake, and the COVID-19. Since the outbreak, networks of social media were flooded by messages of single foods/herbs promising cure or prevention of the infection. The effects of such unfounded claims could lead to negative implications ranging from giving a false sense of protection against the infection to toxicity. At the community level, food access and availability are particularly vulnerable to the implications of the COVID-19 outbreak, primarily because of difficulties in transportation, distribution, and delivery [19] . This situation has led in many instances to 'hoarding'. One way that a pandemic would indirectly impact the food supply chain is by changing consumer behavior. Pandemics create uncertainty and volatility in consumer demand, making it particularly challenging to maintain food inventories in a just in time economy [20] . In a study of the effect of an outbreak on behavior, the most recurrent response is to stockpile supplies, food, and water [21] . Those who can afford extra food may hoard more than they need and pose devastating consequences on at risk-populations. Hoarding could lead to extreme shortages in markets, leading to rapidly rising prices [22] . Therefore, at a community level, it is crucial to spread awareness against 'Panic-buy'. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults and patients with chronic diseases became particularly vulnerable and most at risk to nutrition imbalance. Firstly, available research indicated that adults 60 years and older and patients with preexisting medical conditions, especially heart disease, lung disease, diabetes or cancer are more likely to have severeeven deadly-coronavirus infection than other groups [23] . Second, the recommendations to stay home and abide by social distancing targeted these groups specifically, given their vulnerability. Third, the elderly and patients with chronic diseases may already be susceptible to malnutrition given their compromised health and limited purchasing ability. Therefore, at the level of the community, it is crucial to identify these vulnerable groups and extend assistance in food access and availability through a structured and reliable support system.",

Significant planning is needed at the national level to increase the nation's preparedness, including the formulation of policies to support the production, distribution, and access of this food basket to different communities [24] . Among these policies are those related to mobilization of resources in order to finance food purchases and provisions, tax waiving for staple foods and commodities, and support for agricultural and food production industries.

A particular feature of this pandemic is highlighting the interdependence of these various levels, whereby the health of the individual became a direct function of his own awareness and choices, the unity of the community, the preparedness of the government, and ultimately the global engagement vis a vis this threat. In this perspective, a framework for action and recommendations is presented at each of those levels. A summary of these recommendations are presented in Fig. 2 . The main goal of these recommendations is to maintain the physical and mental health of individuals, resilience of communities, and national and global food security. ",
