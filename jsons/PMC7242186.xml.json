            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), infected more than 3.5 million people in the world and was the cause of more than 250 thousand deaths in nearly 6 months (Dec-May) - data updated on 5th May [1]. This virus belongs to Nidovirales order, Coronaviridae family, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily and, according to its genomic characteristics, was classified in the Betacoronavirus genus. It is an enveloped virus with a single strand, positive-sense RNA genome, with a length of around 29.8 kb and a G+C content of 38% [2], [3]. Scanning electron microscopy images showed a 60-140 \u00b5m round or elliptic virus with frequently pleomorphic shape and distinctive spikes about 8 to 12 nm in length [4]. According to genomic sequencing, SARS-CoV-2 shares 89% homology with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21, 82% with human SARS-CoV and around 50% with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2]. As all the other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 comprises the four structural proteins E (envelope protein), M (membrane protein), N (nucleocapsid protein) and S (spike protein), as well as eight accessory proteins [5]. The spike surface glycoprotein plays an essential role by promoting the attachment of the virus to its receptor on host cells and may determine its host tropism and transmission ability. Receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S-protein from SARS-CoV-2 shares identical 3D structure with the RBD of S-protein from SARS-CoV, as well as 76.47% amino acid sequence homology [6]. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV virus [7], [8]. The novel SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2 [2], [9], [10], [11] with 10 to 20 times higher affinity than SARS-CoV does [12]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 employs the cellular transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein priming, allowing internalization and replication in the host cells [11].",

RAS is an enzymatic cascade starting with the cleavage of angiotensinogen by renin to form angiotensin (Ang) I. This peptide is then further metabolized by ACE1, which removes two amino acids at the C-terminal end to form the potent vasopressor peptide Ang II [23]. Ang II levels are endogenously regulated by the ACE2, which is a membrane-bound mono-carboxypeptidase that cleaves the terminal leucine and phenylalanine residues from Ang I and Ang II originating Ang 1\u20139 and Ang 1\u20137, respectively. The hexapeptide Ang 1\u20137 exerts a potent vasodilator, anti-fibrotic, anti-proliferation and anti-inflammatory effect via activation of its Mas receptor. Its effects counterbalance the ACE1-Ang II-ATR1 system [24].",

Patients with hypertension and diabetes benefit from the use of these drugs, since not only ACE2 is insensitive to blockade by ACE1 inhibitors, but also, the use of these inhibitor drugs increases the ACE2 gene expression and activity, probably due to an accumulation of Ang I [26]. ACE2 has been found to have protective effects against lung injury in different lung injury animal models [8], [27], [28]. Specifically, in diabetes, ACE2 seems to have a protective role in the progression of cardiovascular and renal complications and has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for the management of diabetes and its complications [29], [30]. Studies in mice showed the role of ACE2 in the improvement of glycemia levels in mice with diabetes by direct effects in the pancreas [19], improving insulin sensitivity and glucose-mediated insulin release [31] and reduction of the risk of type 2 diabetes development [32].",

            "text": "It has been found that ACEIs and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) cause an overexpression of ACE2 in patients treated with these drugs [26]. In the study of Soro-Paavonen, patients treated with ACEIs had increased ACE2 activity, independently of the presence of vascular complications [35]. However, the expression of ACE2 mRNA was not measured. Expression levels of ACE2 have been associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection in different cell lines [7], [36], [37], therefore, raising the concern that patients being treated with ACEIs or ARBs could be at higher risk of infection and of associated morbidity and mortality after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to a higher expression of the virus\u2019 entry gate in target tissues [38]. Nevertheless, conflicting information has been found on this topic and some data suggest that ACEIs and ARBs can have protective effects against lung injury [39]. With relatively few clinical studies on this matter, when compared to the pre-clinical studies in animal models, it may be erroneous to admit that the effects of RAS inhibitors on ACE2 expression are translatable to human physiology. Additionally the measurements of ACE2 plasma levels, performed in most studies, may not be a reliable indicator of ACE2 activity, since the full length protein is predominantly membrane bound [39]. Taking advantage of ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 gains access to the cells, however it has been shown that soon after infection ACE2 expression is rapidly downregulated [8]. Whether this effect is caused by the virus, to prevent ACE2 protective effects [28], or results from an indirect mechanism is not yet clear. It has been confirmed in some clinical studies that the long-term use of ACEIs or ARBs by patients is not associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, neither of developing severe COVID-19 or even with a higher risk of in-hospital death [40], [41], [42]. All these studies highlight that the withdrawal of these medications is not recommended to prevent serious COVID-19, since these have well-known benefits in protecting the kidney and myocardium, [39] with the clinical decompensation caused by its removal potentially causing a more serious condition than the viral infection.",

For instance, a retrospective cohort study with 191 Chinese patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed that 48% of the patients had a comorbidity, with diabetes representing 19% of those patients [48]. Another study showed that among 26 deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, 42.3% had diabetes [49]. Also, a different cohort study analyzing 201 patients from Wuhan with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia revealed that 10.9% of the patients had diabetes. They also observed that among the patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (41.8% from the total cohort), more patients had comorbidities than those who did not develop ARDS, being diabetes the second most frequent comorbidity (19.0% in ARDS-patients versus 5.1% in non-ARDS patients) [50]. Furthermore, the largest case series of COVID-19 in China, reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, showed that DM patients had higher mortality rates (7.3%) when compared to overall population (2.3%) in a total of 72,314 analyzed cases [51]. This comes as no surprise, as it is reported that people with diabetes demonstrate higher susceptibility to several infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, pneumonia or influenza [52]. The underlying mechanisms are not completely understood and depend on the type of infection, but some hypotheses have been raised. Some possible explanations for DM being a high-risk factor for COVID-19 may be due to hyperglycemic environment, which is known to increase the virulence of some pathogens. Besides, it was also reported that phagocytosis and chemotaxis are impaired, the production of interleukins in response to infection is reduced, as well as the response of T cells and neutrophils [52], [53]. Overall, the immune response, which is vital to fight against COVID-19 infection, is impaired, especially in diabetic patients with poor blood glucose control.",

            "text": "As mentioned, it is suggested that therapeutics for diabetes and hypertension, namely ACEIs and ARBs, are responsible for upregulating ACE2. On the other hand, this is the functional receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses as cellular entry [9]. In this sense, some authors hypothesize that these therapeutics may contribute for the increased infection and advice to discontinue ACEIs and ARBs, used in patients with diabetes or hypertension. However, there is no clear evidence in animals nor humans confirming this theory. Besides, ACE2 can also be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen, as well as exercise and dehydration. Plus, it was very recently published a Chinese study showing that transplantation of ACE2-mesenchymal stem cells improves the outcome of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [60]. Some studies have actually already shown that overexpressed ACE2 plays a protective role in the lungs with SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting ARBs and ACEIs as therapy [61], [62]. As proof, in a preclinical study, authors injected animals with the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV, to cause a severe lung injury and verified that ACE2 is significantly downregulated. After treating them with ARB losartan, the severe acute lung injury was attenuated [8]. This evidence was supported by findings from China, where they showed that ACE2 blockade resulted in exacerbated lung damage and reduced animal survival after respiratory syncytial virus infection [28]. Actually, there is a comment from an Israel author, published in early March, proposing ARBs and ACEIs as a treatment for patients with COVID-19 infection to reduce the risk or severity of viral pneumonia [63]. However, when the coronavirus spike protein binds to ACE2, there is a downregulation of ACE2, which leads to an excessive accumulation of angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor, pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, edema) and less ACE2 to convert it to angiotensin 1-7 (vasodilator, anti-proliferative, cytoprotective). The big question here is to know who wins this battle: the virus that binds to ACE2, which is upregulated in lungs, or the protective effects caused by the ACE2 upregulation. And this is not clarified yet. In this sense, European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommend that treatment with ARBs and ACEIs should be maintained in patients with diabetes and hypertension [64]. Patients who stop taking them may face more complications regarding kidney failure and increased mortality. Either way, as an alternative treatment, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) can be used, since they seem not to increase ACE2 expression and activity [65].",

A strong candidate that could exert a potent antiviral effect is the anti-malaria chloroquine. It is described that the virus processing and internalization is facilitated by low pH and pH-dependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins [69]. Chloroquine becomes entrapped in membrane-enclosed low pH organelles and is rapidly protonated and concentrated in endosomes, interfering with their acidification. Hydroxychloroquine has been then considered for short-term treatment trials [70]. The antiviral activity of chloroquine combined with azithromycin against COVID-19 in vitro was recently reported. However, the authors found no evidence of a strong antiviral activity or clinical benefit of this combination for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Either way, ongoing randomized clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine should provide a definitive answer regarding the alleged efficacy of this combination and will assess its safety [71]. Also, amiodarone has the ability to interfere with the endocytic pathway, being suggested as a possible inhibitor of the SARS coronavirus [72]. After binding to ACE2, the virus requires the essential serine protease, TMPRSS2, for S protein priming. So, using TMPRSS2 inhibitors (e.g. camostat mesylate), already used to treat cancer and hepatitis, can be a possible or adjuvant therapy [73].",

Not only for the COVID-19 progression, but also as a higher risk to develop secondary infections and therefore worsening of the health state. For those reasons, an effective and tight management of diabetes, specifically of glucose plasma levels, is extremely important in infected patients with diabetes. Additionally, while the use of ACEIs and ARBs in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients has raised some questions regarding their beneficial or harmful effects on disease progression, there is not enough evidence yet that allows drawing conclusions on this issue. Therefore, while care must be taken in the use of these drugs, their abrupt withdrawal is not recommended as it could lead to even more serious complications. Several strategies are being tested to control the COVID-19 pandemic and a better understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 effects on high-risk patients is fundamental to decrease the morbidities and mortality.",
