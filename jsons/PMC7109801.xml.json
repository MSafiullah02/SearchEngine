Currently, 18\u201320 million people are infected, and >100 million are at risk of infection [1]. Of those infected, \u223c30% will develop chronic cardiac pathology \u2a7e10 years after infection. Chronic Chagas disease, or cardiomyopathy, is characterized by inflammatory infiltrates, necrosis, and fibrosis in the heart [1]; inflammatory infiltrates are composed primarily of CD8+ T cells but also contain CD4+ T cells and macrophages [2]. As the disease progresses, the heart becomes enlarged, and, over time, this condition can result in congestive heart failure and sudden death [1, 2]. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms participating in promoting and maintaining inflammation in the heart may foster identification of new therapeutic targets in the treatment of chronic Chagas disease",

            "text": "During the past several years, there has been increased interest in characterizing the expression of proinflammatory chemokine genes in the hearts of T. cruzi\u2013infected mice [3\u20135]. Chemokines and their cognate receptors direct the extravasation of leukocytes and monocytes from the bloodstream into tissues and also regulate the positional migration of these cells in tissues. In addition, in numerous disease models, chemokines have been shown to play a significant role in the influx of cells, where they participate in the control of pathogens and/or contribute to chronic inflammation. Chemokine genes are expressed in the hearts of T. cruzi\u2013infected mice, suggesting that chemokines may play a role in host defense and/or disease. In support of this idea, we and others have determined that CXC chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) and CXCL10, as well as CC chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), are detectable in the heart during both acute and chronic cardiomyopathy [3, 5]. When mice are treated with neutralizing antibodies specific for CXCL9 and CXCL10, the result is increased parasitemia, indicating that these chemokines play an important role in generating a protective immune response [5]; however, blocking these chemokines does not ultimately alter the severity of chronic cardiomyopathy, as characterized by both the parasitic burden and chronic inflammation in the heart. One factor controlling the response to chemokine-ligand expression is the corresponding expression of the appropriate chemokine receptor(s). We have recently shown that T. cruzi\u2013infected mice lacking CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), which recognizes CCL5, results in an increase in both parasitemia and parasitic burden in the heart, an increase that correlates with a paucity of infiltration of T cells and macrophages [4]",

Indeed, after a series of in vitro studies, Aliberti et al. [7] reported that CCL2 signaling both increased the macrophage uptake of T. cruzi and enhanced the production of NO, which resulted in the killing of this parasite. These observations suggest that, by controlling this parasite\u2019s replication, CCL2 may play a role in resistance to infection with T. cruzi. Previous studies in our own and other laboratories have demonstrated that, in response to infection with T. cruzi CCL2 is expressed in the heart [3, 5]. In addition, the CCL2 receptor, CCR2, also is expressed in the heart after infection with T. cruzi, which suggests that it plays an important role in the CCL2:CCR2 signaling axis, thereby promoting host defense. To characterize the in vivo role that CCL2 signaling plays in leukocyte trafficking, CCR2-deficient (CCR2\u2212/\u2212) mice were infected with T. cruzi and both the ability to control this parasite\u2019s replication in the heart and the severity of cardiac inflammation were evaluated",

The hearts were fixed in 10% formalin and were embedded in paraffin, and 5-\u03bcm sections were cut in 100-\u03bcm increments, for staining with hematoxylin-eosin. Each section was scored for inflammation, by an investigator blinded as to its source; and infected cardiomyocytes were counted according to a method described elsewhere [5].

Evaluation of parasitemia revealed no difference between CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice (n=11) and CCR2+/+ mice (n=12), and all mice in both groups survived to day 200 after infection, the last point at which survival was measured (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that (1) CCR2 signaling is not required for control of T. cruzi\u2019s replication in the blood and (2) CCR2 is not an important influence in survival. However, at day 30 after infection, cardiac parasitism in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice was \u223c6-fold higher than that in CCR2+/+ mice (table 1 and figure 1B). Infected cardiomyocytes in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice were often found in close proximity and were frequently quite large, a result that contrasts with what was observed in CCR2+/+ mice (figure 1B). However, the deficiency in the CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice\u2019s control of this parasite\u2019s replication in the heart was eventually overcome, and, at days 60\u2013200 after infection, there were no differences between the 2 groups of mice (table 1)",

            "text": "To determine whether the increase in cardiac parasitism in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice correlated with a muted inflammatory response, the severity of cardiac inflammation was determined by scoring of the hematoxylin-eosin\u2013stained tissues and, by use of the RNase protection assay, examination of the mRNA transcripts for the presence of infiltrating immune cells. As shown in table 1, at no examination time after infection was there any difference between the severity of inflammation in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice and that in CCR2+/+ mice. Consistent with these results is the finding that the mRNA transcript levels for CD4, CD8, and F4/80 detected in the hearts of CCR2+/+ mice were similar to those detected in the hearts of CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice (figure 1C and D). Both interferon (IFN)\u2013\u03b3 and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) have been shown to be important in reducing the parasitic burden in infected tissues [2]; in the present study, however, at no examination time after infection were the transcript levels for either IFN-\u03b3 or iNOS in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice different from those in CCR2+/+ mice (figure 1C and D). Similarly, there were no deficiencies in expression of chemokine transcripts in the hearts of CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice, compared with that in the hearts of CCR2+/+ mice (figure 1E); rather, at days 60 and 120 after infection, expression of CCL5 was increased in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice during chronic infection. Expression of some chemokine receptors was intermittently reduced in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice after infection (figure 1F); for example, at day 30 after infection, expression of CXCR3 in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice was \u223c3-fold lower than that in wild-type control mice, and, at day 60 after infection, expression of CCR5 in these mice was \u223c5-fold lower than that in wild-type control mice. Evaluation either by histological analysis or on the basis of expression of markers for T cells and macrophages showed that at no examination time after infection was the infiltration of leukocytes into the heart decreased in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice, a finding that implies that signaling through CCR2 may play a role in both cell activation and expression of other chemokine receptors. The immune response in peripheral tissue also did not appear to be decreased in CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice: at days 30 and 60 after infection, expression of chemokines in the spleen of CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice was increased, compared with that in the spleen of CCR2+/+ mice; however, at days 15, 30, 60, and 120 after infection, expression of chemokine receptors was similar in both groups of mice (data not shown). Collectively, these data (1) demonstrate that CCR2 neither enhances immune-cell infiltration into the heart nor influences antiparasitic effector responses such as expression of either IFN-\u03b3 or iNOS and (2) imply that CCR2 is important in the control of T. cruzi\u2019s replication in the heart. Therefore, the mechanism by which CCR2 controls this parasite\u2019s replication is not dependent on the regulation of cardiac inflammation",

            "text": "CCR2 is the primary receptor for CCL2 and is found on monocytes, activated T cells, B cells, and NK cells [8]. Recent studies have indicated that, in response to stimuli or infection, CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice display deficiencies in trafficking of T cells and macrophages [9, 10]. Previous studies have also demonstrated that CCL2 can activate T cells and macrophages, presumably through binding to CCR2 expressed on the surface of these cells [10, 11]. Indeed, leukocyte populations from CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice do not bind CCL2 and exhibit defects both in activation and in recruitment to sites of inflammation [9]. Infection of CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice with various microbial pathogens has increased our understanding of how this receptor contributes to immunological events involved in host protection; for example, CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice with lungs infected with Cryptococcus neoformans exhibit a decreased protective Th1 response accompanied by a switch to a strong Th2 response [12]. This switch in Th responses correlates with both prolonged infection and the infecting agent\u2019s greater dissemination throughout the body. Analysis of CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice either infected with Leishmania donovani or immunized with shistosomal antigen has revealed an impaired cellular immune response characterized both by reduced T cell and macrophage recruitment to sites of antigen localization and by decreased expression of IFN-\u03b3 [11, 13]. Collectively, these studies strongly suggest that expression of CCR2 is required for the development of protective Th1 responses after microbial challenge. The findings of the present study indicate that, in T. cruzi\u2013infected mice, the absence of CCR2 does not decrease expression of IFN-\u03b3 (figures 1C and D); nor were there increased numbers of transcripts for the Th2-associated cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that the increased parasitic burden in the hearts of CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice is a result of a muted Th1 response accompanied by increased expression of Th2-associated cytokines",

Chemokines such as CCL2 and CXCL10 increase nitrite production by infected cardiomyocytes to a level that is sufficient for control of this parasite\u2019s replication [14]. Moreover, by virtue of their enhancement of both production of NO and phagocytosis of trypomastigotes, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 have been implicated in promoting the trypanocidal activities of macrophages, with CCL2 being the most potent chemokine promoting these activities [7]. In addition to promoting these trypanocidal activities, CCL2 may also be important in promoting the effective survival responses of cardiomyocytes. Indeed, in a model of myocardial trauma, CCL2 signaling through CCR2 has been found to be associated with increased cardiomyocyte survival [15]. These findings highlight the possibility that CCR2 plays a previously unappreciated role in host defense after infection with T. cruzi",

Potential mechanisms by which CCR2 signaling enhances tissue-specific host defense may include regulation of phagocytosis of trypomastigotes and/or control of T. cruzi\u2019s intracellular replication, possibly through the sequestering of required growth factors. Ongoing studies are under way to further characterize the mechanisms by which CCR2 promotes the killing of this parasite",
