These workers often take on serious risks when they do so. The Black Death (bubonic plague) swept through Medieval Europe on various occassions, leading to debate over whether physicians and other public officials had a duty to remain with the sick (Luther 1527). During the 1918 influenza pandemic, many nurses and others who volunteered to care for the infected themselves contracted the deadly influenza (Godderis and Rossiter 2013). After the 1995 Aum Shinrokyo Sarin attacks, 10% of hospital HCWs involved in treating exposed patients ended up needing to be treated themselves because patients\u2019 clothes exposed them to Sarin (Rebera and Rafalowski 2014). In the 2002\u20132003 SARS outbreak, approximately 30% of all cases occurred in HCWs; in Toronto, about half of the cases were in HCWs, three of whom died (Malm et al. 2008). Towards the end of the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa, 898 cases of Ebola infection had occurred in HCWs, of whom 518 died (Statista 2015). The lethality of the virus is well-known, but the HCWs were disproportionately impacted. Liberia was worst hit, where 8.07% of its health workforce died from the virus, compared to 0.11% of its general population (Evans et al. 2015). Not only did caring for patients put HCWs at risk of physical disease and death, but some who survived faced stigmatisation and discrimination afterwards (OHCHR 2014).",

Disaster responders typically choose to enter disaster zones, and usually have specialised training to prepare for such events. This chapter will not focus on such responders, but on HCWs who find themselves in the midst of a CBRNE event. They may find themselves grappling with whether or not they have an ethical obligation to continue to provide health care to those injured in the event. The ethical question is whether HCWs have a duty to care for any and all patients in the event of a CBRNE crisis. In other words, are HCWs obliged to accept the risks that accompany caring for patients after a CBRNE event? In recent years, \u2018the issue of duty to care has emerged as a matter of paramount concern among health care professionals, hospital administrators, public policy makers, and bioethicists\u2019 (Ruderman et al. 2006, 2).",

The heroism apparent during the Ebola outbreak led Time to declare these HCWs the 2014 Person of the Year (Von Drehle and Baker 2014). A report into the SARS outbreak in Toronto found that, \u2018Workers generally showed heroism and altruism in the face of danger during the SARS outbreak\u2019 (University of Toronto 2005, 10). However, this was not the case for all. The Toronto report continued that \u2018some balked at caring for people infected with SARS, and a few were dismissed for failing to report for duty. Post-SARS, many health care workers raised concerns about the level of protection to themselves and their families. Some even left the profession\u2019 (University of Toronto 2005, 10).",

On an individual level, workers have to balance their ethical duties towards their patients and the public with those towards themselves and their own health, and their duties towards their families and other dependants. The societal level is seen most clearly by the devastation brought by Ebola onto the healthcare workforce in the affected countries. These systems started with woefully inadequate healthcare workforces, and the deaths of so many HCWs from Ebola have left the systems even more debilitated. Although Ebola was directly devastating in many ways, an additional 25,000 deaths may occur each year because of the deaths of so many HCWs in these countries (Evans et al. 2015). A healthcare system, and society more broadly, must somehow balance its ethical duty to care for those presently sick while knowing that this can increase the risks to the long-term health of the people in their societies who will require care in the future.",

Ethical decision-making\nskills are needed to address such issues. Yet in spite of the acknowledged importance of such topics, the Toronto SARS report found that \u2018There is currently a vacuum in this field\u2019 (University of Toronto 2005, 10). In the US, for example, the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic led to several calls to develop pandemic readiness plans. Such plans identify the duty to care as one of several ethical principles\n(Koenig et al. 2011). Some US states have pandemic plans, but few address the duty to care explicitly. Louisiana, the state most directly hit by Hurricane Katrina, is one that does, defining the duty to care as \u2018the obligation of health care professionals to care for patients at all times\u2019 (Louisiana Department of Health & Hospitals 2014, 10). It notes that during pandemics HCWs will have to balance their duty to individual patients with that to all patients.

Workers\u2019 rights and the importance of creating safe workplaces is increasingly recognised, appropriately so. Yet these developments could raise questions about policies that put HCWs at increased risk of harm. As noted above, the duty to care usually refers to individual patients. During a crisis, like a CBRNE event, a balance may be needed between the duty to care for individuals and for society as a whole. In additional, the duty not to harm is a strong ethical principle. HCWs may see their duty not to harm patients as obliging them to avoid contagious or contaminated patients because of the risk that they could pick up the agent and pass it on to others unknowingly. While the duty to care is a long-standing ethical principle in healthcare, it raises many ethical challenges that require further careful reflection and analysis.",

Arguments are made to view healthcare organisations as businesses, patients as consumers, and HCWs as employees contracted to deliver a service. As such approaches come to infuse the ethos of healthcare, they may inadvertently impact responses to CBRNE crises. Sheri Fink\u2019s investigation into Hurricane Katrina included an exploration of some of the corporate decision-making that interferred with patient care and rescue (Fink 2013). This sort of approach can lead to a focus on contractual obligations towards workers and patients, which may not address obligations to society as a whole. As will be discussed more below, a contractual approach has particular limitations when altruism and sacrifice are required, which is usually the situation when the duty to care is invoked.",

            "text": "Granted the limitations of the surveys cited above, the possibility that a significant proportion of the healthcare workforce might not show up in the aftermath of a CBRNE crisis is of concern. This conflicts with what can be called the traditional view of the duty to care in emergencies. Daniel Defoe captured this view dramatically in his fictionalised account of the Great Plague of London which may have claimed up to 20% of the population in 1665. The book examines many of the same ethical issues that challenged the responders to Ebola virus disease.So the Plague defied all Medicine; the very Physicians were seized with it, \u2026 This was the Case of several Physicians, even some of them the most eminent; \u2026 it rather is to their Praise, that they ventured their Lives so far as even to lose them in the Service of Mankind; They endeavoured to do good, and to save the Lives of others (Defoe 1969, 35\u20136).This traditional view is that doctors and nurses will lay down their lives for their patients and the good of society. This ethic has been lived out in HCWs and disaster responders throughout history. Those who stayed to take care of Ebola patients, or came to offer what they could, acted upon this view (Von Drehle 2014). In battle-torn Syria, the White Helmets formed a volunteer group to provide aid and rescue to those injured by chemical and explosive devices. Their motto is \u2018Whoever saves one life, saves all of humanity\u2019 (Malsin 2016, 23). Among responders like these, the duty to care focuses on putting the needs of others above ones own needs. The belief is that those who have specialised training, or more opportunities than others, thereby have a responsibility to help those in need. Martin Luther gave similar advice to those facing the Black Death: \u2018paid public servants such as city physicians, city clerks and constables, or whatever their titles, should not flee unless they furnish capable substitutes who are acceptable to their employer\u2019 (Luther 1527, 477).",

Different reasons have been given for this, including the general belief that infectious diseases had been overpowered, as least in those countries with access to effective antibiotics (Ruderman et al. 2006). The move from healthcare as a calling to one where healthcare is a rewarding and finantially comfortable career has been implicated in this change, as well as the business model for healthcare organisations. The arrival in the 1980s of HIV and AIDS, especially at first when little was known about its transmission and less about its treatment, led to further weakening of the meaning of the duty to care. SARS, H1N1 and Ebola raised further questions about what the duty to care implies, both ethically and practically. In response, nurses in Liberia went on strike during the Ebola outbreak because of low wages and the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) that guards against infectious diseases like Ebola (Agence France-Presse 2014). Likewise, nurses in the US protested, and some went on strike, to express concern over the lack of preparation and protective equipment for Ebola in their hospitals (Skinner and Johnson 2014).",

Risks are part of all forms of practice, and can arise physically, such as from needle-sticks, using certain equipment, lifting patients, etc., and also emotionally, such as from watching patients suffer and even die. Training should make people aware of these risks and therefore HCWs consent to accept these risks as part of professional practice. This is especially the case when someone works in infectious diseases, but applies to all HCWs. The criticism of this argument is that SARS, H1N1 and Ebola have changed healthcare practice. Risks from serious infectious diseases did not exist for many HCWs trained in earlier years, and hence people have not in any realistic way consented to take on some of the risks that exist today.",

If someone becomes a firefighter, he cannot object to getting close to fires. As part of the decision to pursue particular careers, certain risks must be accepted even if this is done implicitly or changes over time. The criticism of this argument is that even if accepted in principle, it does not necessarily entail that all HCWs have a duty to care for all patients, particularly those who put HCWs at higher risk. For example, someone with training in infectious diseases may have a duty to care for infected patients, but this does not imply that a psychiatric nurse has the same duty to those patients. Thus, the duty to care should be limited to those who have relevant training and experience in the conditions that ail the patient.",

Healthcare ethics in Western contexts has become focused on individuals and their rights. Public health crises and CBRNE events remind us of the need to consider relationships and communities within ethics. At the same time, such approaches do not provide clear mechanisms for balancing the duties HCWs have to the variety of people they are in relationships with: family, neighbours, colleagues, patients.

These should take account of differences in expertise and skills possessed by various HCWs, although as needs develop, people may be asked to work beyond their usual responsibilities. The risks that HCWs are asked to accept should reasonably be expected to make a difference in the pandemic. This highlights the importance of policies being based on the best available evidence. Reasonable accomodations should also be made for those whose own health changes their risk, such as those who may be immunocompromised or pregnant.

In his study of trust in the helping professions, Edmund Pellegrino finds that contractual agreements tend to lead to \u2018ethical minimalism\u2019 (1991, 79). \u2018The professional\u2019s necessity to efface self-interest will be blunted since legalistic and contractual relationships call upon the participants to protect their own interest, not that of the other party\u2014except to the extent the contract requires. The impetus to do the \u201cextra\u201d that requires some compromise of self-interest is blunted if not destroyed entirely\u2019 (ibid.). In CBRNE crises, going the extra mile is exactly what needs to be encouraged, and this requires a return to traditional professional values and what are called ethical virtues: the personal character traits that lead people to strive for ethical ideals.",

A small amount of research has been conducted on the factors that motivate people to work during CBRNE events. In one study, the leading motivational factor was a sense of duty to their profession, but other factors included concern for their family\u2019s health, personal safety and child care (Masterson et al. 2009).

In this way, the movie Megan Leavy tells the story of a US Marine and her dog Rex whose job was to search for explosives to protect their colleagues (Cowperthwaite 2017). In spite of the dangers to themselves, she and other CBRNE responders enact the virtues needed to fulfil the duty to care in crisis situations. The Time stories thus reveal modern-day heroes who chose to act on their duty to care as a result of their virtues and in spite of their fears. It is just as important to praise those who in less dramatic ways act on the basis of their moral courage and exemplify the ethical traits needed to promote sacrificial behaviour on behalf of others and society. These are ordinary people who do extraordinary things based on virtues like courage, compassion and commitment to the good of others. As those values and virtues are promoted, the duty to care will once more be seen as part of what it means to be a virtuous healthcare worker.",
