In the current study, 184 specimens from pigs with or without signs of diarrhea were collected from 39 farms across eight provinces, mainly around Hunan, People's Republic of China, in 2017 to 2018 in order to obtain epidemiological information on PEDV infections in these regions. The results indicated an average PEDV-positive rate of 38.04% (70/184) and more-pronounced disease severity in diarrheic pigs (48.76%; 59/121) than in non-diarrheic pigs (17.46%; 11/63). Phylogenetic and sequence analysis demonstrated that 14 representative PEDV strains from 14 swine farms belonged to the G2 group (G2-a and G2-b subgroups) and displayed a high degree of genetic variation. In particular, two out of the 14 PEDV strains were found to have unique indels in the S1 gene. The strain HN-SY-2017-Oct had a 9-nucleotide (T 1152 GAA GCC AAT 1160 T) insertion, and the strain ZJ-2018-May had a 3-nucleotide (AAA) deletion at position 1126 in the S1 gene. A three-dimensional structural prediction revealed that these unique insertions might lengthen the loop on the surface or increase the likelihood of the surface protein being phosphorylated at 388 Y, thereby affecting the virulence or pathogenicity of PEDV. Collectively, the data show that PED remains a severe threat to the pig industry and that variant PEDV stains are circulating in China. The updated PEDV epidemiological data will facilitate the design of PEDV vaccines and the application of effective measures for PED prevention.",

The disease porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) was first described in England in 1971, the causative agent, PEDV, was subsequently identified, isolated, and designated CV777 in Belgium in 1978 [20] . Since October 2010, a new variant of PEDV has emerged in over ten provinces of China. The main clinical manifestations of PED include watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, with high mortality (nearly 100%) of newborn piglets [4] . Outbreaks of PED on farms where pigs had been vaccinated with inactivated or attenuated CV777-based vaccines have been reported in recent years, suggesting that the present vaccines based on classical PEDV strains cannot completely protect pigs against the variant strains of PEDV that are circulating in China [32] . The first outbreak of PED in the USA was confirmed in April 2013, and cases were documented in over 30 US states in a short period of time. PEDV then swept across Canada Handling Editor: Sheela Ramamoorthy.",

            "text": "PEDV has an RNA genome that is ~ 28 kb in length and contains at least eight major open reading frames (ORFs) encoding four structural and three non-structural proteins [12, 23] . The spike (S) glycoprotein of PEDV, a major surface protein, is composed of two subunits containing conserved nonamer and GxCx motifs, namely the S1 and S2 proteins [4] . The S1 protein is essential for recognition of cellular receptors, binding, and virulence, while the S2 protein mainly mediates membrane fusion during virus infection [15, 25] . The S1 gene of most PEDV strains is more variable than the S2 gene and has therefore been extensively employed for analysis of genetic relatedness and evolution as well as vaccine development [6] . The ORF3 protein of PEDV, a non-structural protein, has been shown to be important for the virulence of PEDV strains [19] . Due to the deletion of 17 amino acids in the ORF3 of PEDV vaccine isolates, the ORF3 gene can be used as a molecular marker to distinguish between PEDV vaccine and non-vaccine strains and to analyze the molecular epidemiology of PEDV [19] .",

We also tested for other diarrheacausing pathogens, including TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) and PoRV (porcine rotavirus group A), but not PDCoV (porcine deltacoronavirus), in order to estimate the co-infection rate in these samples. Furthermore, the complete ORF3 and S1 genes of 14 representative PEDV strains from 14 swine farms in these regions were cloned, sequenced, and extensively analyzed.",

The analysis identified potential breakpoints in the HN-SY strain at nt positions 968 and 1480 (position alignment based on the S1 gene) when compared with two parental PEDV strains (AJ1102 and HN-YY-CH-2018-Mar) (Fig. 4A) . Another strain from Zhejiang province had potential breakpoints at nt 919 and 1582 relative to the AJ1102 and HN-SY strains (Fig. 4B) . Three-dimensional structure modeling of the S1 proteins of two novel PEDV strains predicted that the unique insertion of three continuous amino acids ( 381 KPI 383 ) would affect the protein surface, lengthening a loop on the surface and slightly changing its conformation (Fig. 4C) . Analysis using NetPhos 2.0 software indicated that this alteration might increase the likelihood of phosphorylation occurring at 388 Y (score = .881 > 0.50).",

In particular, a nearly 50% PEDV-positive rate was found in pigs with diarrhea, which is consistent with a recent report [8] . This suggests that PEDV remains a major pathogenic agent in China, as was also confirmed by examining data from previous investigations of the PEDV epidemic conducted in China (Fig. 1B) . Therefore, more efforts are required to prevent and control this virus in the future. b) The overall rate of PEDV infection in pigs without diarrhea in the present study was higher than that found in a recent investigation [30] , suggesting that attention should also be paid to these pigs. c) Although the detection rates of TGEV (3.26%; 6/184) and PoRV (3.80%; 7/184) were relatively low, the presence and circulation of other diarrhea-causing pathogens, including intestinal parasites (Balantidium coli, Coccidia, etc.), bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, etc.), and novel viruses such as porcine deltacoronavirus [13] , and porcine enteric alphacoronavirus [17] , are possible on pig farms in China. In particular, the question of whether coinfections with multiple viruses occur in individual PEDVpositive pigs warrants further investigation.",

This suggests that, as in most provinces in China, the epidemic situation of PEDV in Hunan is serious, and close monitoring of PEDV infection on pig farms is needed. Consequently, further investigations are required to understand the pathogenicity and transmission of PEDV so that appropriate strategies can be applied to prevent PED. Notably, recent investigations have indicated that this viral pathogen can be transmitted through contaminated feed and appliances [9] . The airborne route is another main pathway for PEDV dissemination in addition to fecal-oral transmission [14] . These observations could partly explain why culture density, animal welfare, and climate collectively contribute to differences in prevalence of PEDV infection in these provinces.",

We therefore sequenced the whole S1 and ORF3 genes of 14 PEDV strains from 14 representative swine farms in order to obtain information about virulence determinants. We identified a series of single nucleotide substitutions located in the S1 (including two epitope domains) and ORF3 genes which might contribute to the variability of PEDV strains at both the nucleotide and amino acid level. Notably, these 14 PEDV strains share high nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity in their S1 and ORF3 genes with each other but exhibit low nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity to the typical PEDV strain CV777 and its attenuated variant. Two novel PEDV variants, one (HN-SY-2017-Oct) with a continuous amino acid (KPI) insertion at position 381 ( 381 KPI), and the other (ZJ-2018-May) with an amino acid deletion (K) at position 372 ( 372 K) were identified. Amino acid insertions and deletions in the S gene (including the S1 gene) have been shown to affect viral pathogenicity [10, 18] . Although attempts at direct isolation and propagation of these two novel PEDV strains in various cell lines failed, we are still able to speculate that these strains are virulent. For instance, the swine farm where the novel PEDV strain HN-SY-2017-Oct was obtained was documented to suffer from destructive economic losses, suggesting that this variant strain has enhanced virulence and that traditional vaccines failed to protect pigs against infection. Moreover, structural prediction analysis showed that the insertion of three continuous amino acids ( 381 KPI 383 ) would lengthen the loop domain on the surface and alter the surface structure of this variant S1 protein, thereby contributing to the phosphorylation at position of 388 Y (score = 0.881 > 0.50, indicating a high probability of being phosphorylated). Accumulating evidence has shown that the phosphorylation of surface proteins affects viral pathogenicity by altering the corresponding signaling pathway in the host cell [1, 29] . Experimental studies are needed to verify that phosphorylation occurs at position 388 Y and to examine its effects. These findings highlight the necessity to monitor currently circulating variant strains of PEDV.",
