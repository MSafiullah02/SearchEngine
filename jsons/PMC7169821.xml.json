Rich and Wanyoike (2010) investigated the economic impacts to the stakeholder along the supply chain for the 2007 RVF outbreak in Kenya. They concluded that on a macroeconomic basis, the Kenyan economy lost more than $32 million. Following the Saudi Arabia RVF outbreak in 2000, Rich and Wanyoike discuss the economic losses in the Somali Region of Ethiopia to be $132 million due to the trade losses of live animals. In a working paper by Hughes\u2010Fraire et al. (2011), they estimate the impacts of a hypothetical RVF outbreak in south\u2010eastern Texas in the United States. Similar to this study, they used an epidemiological model combined with an agricultural sector partial equilibrium model and human health information. To model the epidemiological impacts, the authors used data from the 1999 West Nile virus outbreak. Furthermore, they used cost of illness data for influenza to arrive at the human economic impacts. They concluded that the total national welfare loss to the agricultural sector and the economic impacts to humans could range from between $0.1 billion and $2.3 billion. Additionally, the authors pointed out that these estimates are likely underestimated because not all susceptible livestock are evaluated, other damages to society (e.g. tourism), changes in consumer demand and international trade are not incorporated into the study.",

Vensim is a framework based on system dynamic principles that modelled the spread of RVFv from index cases or infectious vectors. This approach is used in conjunction with meteorological conditions prevailing in Manhattan, Kansas, and their interplay with the local susceptible animal, human and vector population within the environment.4 Outbreaks occurred in the second and third quarters of 2009 when weather conditions and mosquito vectors indicate that humans and cattle may develop RVF infections in and around Manhattan, KS. Once an RVF outbreak was identified, eradication measures are implemented that include reducing the mosquito population and access of the vertebrate population to mosquitoes, and the culling of livestock. In these analyses, the baseline model assumed that the RVF outbreak is detected when either 100 cows or 10 humans became ill.

The indirect effects evaluated include the following: (i) the effect of culling and destroying animals on the non\u2010agricultural regional economy (e.g. retail trade), (ii) the economic implication of a travel ban that would limit recreational and non\u2010essential travel in and out of a region and (iii) the indirect effects from the stimulus to the region created by the expenditures during government eradication and clean\u2010up efforts.6\n",

The standard approach to placing a value on mortality is using the value of a statistical life (VSL). The VSL is commonly determined through a hedonic wage analysis looking at the differences in wages by individuals employed in occupations with different rates of mortality. Because numerous studies have estimated VSL using such hedonic wage analyses, several government agencies have relied on meta\u2010analyses to obtain a VSL. Using a meta\u2010analysis conducted by Viscusi and Aldy (2003), they found the mean VSL in the United States varied from $5.5 to $7.6 million. Using the mid\u2010point of this range ($6.55 million) and adjusting for inflation to 2009 yields a VSL of $8.16 million. This implies that the value of mortality can be calculated as follows:(1)Value of Mortality from RVF=No. of lives lost from RVF\u00d78160000\n",

The most commonly used approach, COI, is calculated by summing up the direct medical expenses (e.g. expense of doctor office visit) to individuals and the indirect expenses in productivity. Although the COI approach is commonly used, it has several shortcomings in this situation. First, most COI studies use ex post data to calculate expenses. Because RVF has never occurred in the United State before and has only occurred in East Africa and the Middle East, which has vastly different healthcare systems, it is impossible to use COI data to calculate the expenses. Secondly, costs associated with pain and suffering are ignored. With most individuals willing to pay some amount to avoid the symptoms of RVF, the true cost of morbidity is likely underestimated with the COI approach.",

In 2003, the United States faced complete trade bans on beef due to isolated incidences of BSE. The recovery to pre\u2010outbreak trade status has been long and painful to the beef industry participants, as a result the isolated BSE events. As a percentage of total beef production, US beef exports dropped to 1.9% in 2004 from 9.6% in 2003 and recovered to 7.4% by 2008 (LMIC, 2012).",

As a result, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Yemen and the United Arab Emirates banned imports for 1 year, while Saudi Arabia imposed a 6\u2010year ban on imports (Desta, 2007). Although the actual length of export restrictions will vary by disease, livestock and meat products, trade agreements in place and historical relationships between countries involved, these observations provide informative guidelines.",

In the infected mosquitoes escaping scenario, producers were negatively impacted by $1877.6 million while consumers gained $1752.5 million. In the research laboratory fire scenario, the producers' losses to capital and management and consumers' welfare gains were $1515.3 million and $2005.1 million, respectively. The positive consumer surplus changes are a result of small supply shocks and loss of international export markets (see Paarlberg et al., 2008; Nogueira et al., 2011; Tozer and Marsh, 2012 for further discussion). In other words, if adverse consumer's reaction to a disease outbreak is small and only few livestock are culled, it is possible for consumers of agricultural products to benefit from a small RVF outbreak because bans on agricultural exports lead to oversupply and reduce domestic meat and dairy prices, which benefit consumers.",

Furthermore, it was assumed the infections would be distributed infections between adults and children at the same rate as their prevalence in the study regions population. According to the US Census, 84.2% is 18 years old or older, whereas the remaining 15.8% are under the age of 18 in Manhattan, Kansas. Thus, the economic effects for morbidity and mortality from RVF were calculated as follows:(2)C=H\u00d7{84.2%\u00d7(1%\u00d7WTPblind,adult+98%\u00d7WTPillness,adult+1%\u00d7VSLadult)+15.8%\u00d7(1%\u00d7WTPblind,child+98%\u00d7WTPillness,child+1%\u00d7VSLchild)} Where C is the expected economic effect, H is the number of infected humans, WTP is willingness to pay to avoid blindness or illness in adults or children, and VSL is value of statistical life. The number of infected humans is from the epidemiological output (Table 4). Values for VSLadult and VSLchild were both set at $8 160 000 based on Viscusi and Aldy (2003). The WTP values were provided by the survey (see DHS (2010) for more details). The WTP estimates for the adults avoiding blindness (WTPblind,adult) and flu illness (WTPillness,adult) were $75 833 and $1525, respectively.9 The WTP to avoid blindness (WTPblind,child) and flu illness (WTPillness,child) in children were $198 728 and $8494, respectively.10 Substituting these values into the above equation implied that the expected economic effect for each infection is $85 126. To arrive at the total human health economic effect for the RVF outbreak, multiply $85 126 by the number of infected humans. The total impacts for the 10 infected mosquitoes and fire in the research laboratory scenarios were $6.07 million and $0.01 million, respectively.",
