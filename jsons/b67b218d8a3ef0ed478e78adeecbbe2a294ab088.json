The main aim of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive clinical summary of all the available data from high-quality research articles relevant to the epidemiology, demographics, trends in hospitalization and outcomes, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic methods and treatment methods of COVID-19, thus increasing awareness in health care providers. We also discussed various preventive measures to combat COVID-19 effectively.

SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated from bats and transmitted to humans from an intermediate host, civets and dromedary camels, respectively. Still, no source or intermediate host has been confirmed yet via genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis [2] . This hypothesis was made because previous coronavirus strains have originated from the Rhinolophus affinis bat [8] . However, Xiao et al reported the isolation and characterization of a 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus from pangolins (Manis javanica) [9] . Similarly, in October 2019, a viral metagenomic study of pangolins identified severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-related sequences [10, 11] . According to the study by Xu et al, 60% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 had traveled to Wuhan or nearby regions (60%), 36% had close contact with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) patients and 4% had no definite exposure [12] . According to the study by Tian et al, 40 .5% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 had traveled to Wuhan or nearby regions [13] . Beijing is the fourth mostaffected city in China [13] .",

Chen et al analyzed 99 patients in a retrospective single-center study in Wuhan, and patients presented with fever (83%), cough (82%), SOB (31%), muscle aches (11%), confusion (9%), headache (8%), sore throat (5%), rhinorrhea (4%), chest pain 2%, diarrhea (3%), nausea and vomiting (1%) [15] . According to Wang et al, even though fever is the most common symptom of COVID-19, the absence of fever in COVID-19 cases is more frequent than in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [20] . Lillie et al presented a case where symptom onset started with fever, which then progressed to sore throat and dry cough followed by diffuse myalgia [21] .",

Xu et al reported a decreased lymphocyte count in 28% of their patients [12] , while Yang et al reported leukopenia and lymphopenia in 24% and 35% of their patient population respectively [18] . An elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) was reported in 52-55% of the patients [12, 18] . Thrombocytopenia was seen in 13% of patients. Acute kidney injury was present likely due to dehydration, not from the virus directly [21] . According to the meta-analysis done by Lippi et al, elevated procalcitonin levels were associated with almost five-fold increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection (odds ratio (OR): 4.76; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.74 -8.29). They advised that serial measurements of procalcitonin may play a pivotal role in analyzing the worsening of the disease to more severe form [26] . According to the case report by Ruan et al, they found a patient with a negative nucleic acid test, tested twice 8 days apart. As the patient was showing typical CT imaging patterns suspicious for COVID-19 and deterioration of symptoms, repeat testing on day 11 was positive. As exact biological characteristics of COVID-19 are still not defined well, multiple sampling from multi-sites for the highly suspected population can be useful for COVID-19 detection at a much earlier stage [27] . Specimens should be tested for routine bacterial and viral infections, as well as using both upper and lower respiratory tract samples to test for SARS-CoV-2 [3] . Serological tests are in development, and they can be used if RT-PCR is not available [3] . As per the case reported by Chen et al, the oropharyngeal swab test of COVID-19 RNA turned positive even during the convalescence period in a confirmed case; it emphasizes the significance of active surveillance of COVID-19 RNA for inactivity assessment [28] .",

Chest CT is an important tool for diagnostic for lung diseases. Combining imaging with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Because the time of onset of symptoms to ARDS can be as short as 9 days, early recognition of the disease is therefore essential for management. In a retrospective study done in Wuhan on 81 patients from December 20, 2019 to January 23, 2020, they were able to describe the characteristics of the chest CT at specified time points during the disease course. They have divided the patients into four different groups, as shown in Table 1 [30] . Based on the review, COVID-19 pneumonia is described radiographically as bilateral, subpleural ground-glass opacities with air bronchograms, ill-defined margins and slight predominance on the right lower lobe. It was also noted that the radiological evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia is consistent with the clinical course of the disease. Therefore, serial CT could help monitor disease progression. The study also pointed out that patients with old age, male and with underlying comorbidities as well as progressive radiographic deterioration on follow-up are the risks for poor prognosis [30] . According to Chen et al, the majority (75%) of patients had bilateral pneumonic changes on CT imaging [15] . Guan et al reported 230 out of 1,099 (20%) cases [31] , and Chung et al reported three out of 21 (14%) have normal CT scans for patients diagnosed with symptoms along with confirmation of infection with RT-PCR [32] . According to a single-center study done by Chen et al in 99 patients, 75% of patients showed bilateral pneumonia, ARDS developed in 17% and 11% of them died with multi-organ failure [15] .",

Gao et al described chloroquine as a cheap and safe drug available for more than 70 years, which has been shown to have apparent efficacy and decent safety against pneumonia associated with COVID-19 in multicenter trials performed in China. As per the review of results from 10 hospitals and more than 100 patients, they showed that chloroquine phosphate is superior to control in decreasing the exacerbation of COVID-19 pneumonia. The anti-inflammatory and antiviral property of chloroquine may be responsible for its potent efficacy against COVID-19 pneumonia [39] . Chloroquine phosphate is orally administered at a dose of 500 mg for adults, two times/day. Chloroquine was found to block SARS-CoV-2 infection at low micromolar concentration, with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 1.13 \u00b5M and a half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) greater than 100 \u00b5M [40] . Emodin or promazine blocks interaction between S-protein and ACE-2, therefore, it could abolish SARS-CoV infection by being a competitive inhibitor [17] . nation has shown to synergistically inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in animal and human cell lines [41] . Kim et al have reported a case of MERS-CoV successfully treated with triple combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin and IFN-alpha2a therapy in South Korea [42] . Remdesivir has been reported to inhibit human and zoonotic coronavirus in vitro and restrains SARS-CoV in vivo [17] . Remdesivir + IFN-B was found to be superior to lopinavir/ritonavir + IFN-B therapy against MERS-CoV in vitro and in vivo. Yamamoto et al have found that nelfinavir could strongly inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV [43] . Akerstrom et al have reported that organic nitric oxide could significantly inhibit the replication cycle of SARS-CoV in a concentration-dependent manner and could be taken via inhalation [44] . Favipiravir is a drug currently undergoing testing to combat COVID-19. It was approved for the treatment of novel influenza in China. Favipiravir is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor. It inhibits the replication of RNA viruses like noro, arena, flavi, alpha, bunya, filo groups. Therefore, favipiravir may have potential antiviral action on SARS-CoV-2, which is an RNA virus. A clinical trial involving 80 patients has shown that favipiravir had more potent antiviral action than that of lopinavir/ritonavir. It had significantly fewer adverse events than the lopinavir/ritonavir group [38] .",

Hence, more consideration is given to hand hygiene, disinfection of contaminated surfaces as well as patient's stools and vomitus [52] . Close contact tracing and longitudinal surveillance through serial nucleic acid tests are essential in combating disease as asymptomatic carriers play a significant role in spreading the disease [23] . Effective management and treatment play a very crucial role, starting from identifying appropriate treatment and curing patients.

Imai et al provided the first estimation of the reproduction factor, using R 0 of 2.6 and based on the number of cases in China and those detected in other countries [57] . Other authors estimated R 0 to be 3.813, 6.4714, 2.215 and 2.6816 [20] . According to Wang et al, the model used to calculate R 0 was assumed of the model from Wuhan, China, as summarized in Table 6 . The model used to calculate R 0 assumed that there were no new transmissions from animals, no differences in individual immunity, the time-scale of the epidemic is much faster than specific times for demographic processes (natural birth and death), and there are no differences in natural births and deaths [20] . Assuming the epidemic continues to develop with R 0 = 1.9, 2.6 and 3.19 from December 1, 2019, the number of infections will continue to rise. By the end of February 2020, COVID-19 cases would be 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989 in Wuhan, China with R 0 = 1.9, 2.6 and 3.1, respectively [20] . According to Read's research, R 0 for COVID-19 outbreak is much higher compared with other emergent coronaviruses [58] . We see a decreased trend in R t as discussed in Table 6 with effective implementation of public health measures to control the spread of the disease.",

Several sequelae were seen including, coagulation activation, cellular immune deficiency, hepatic and kidney injury, secondary bacterial infection and myocardial injury. Lymphopenia and sustained inflammation seen in patients with severe disease and death are most likely secondary to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of COVID-19 due to previous exposure to other coronaviruses [30] . Especially this kind of pattern is also seen in patients who had SARS during an epidemic in 2003 [40] .",

Unfortunately, knowledge about the novel virus is limited, causing lots of concern and panic. To decrease morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, public health and infection control measures are urgently required to limit the global spread of the virus. All efforts should be made to slow the spread of the illness in order to provide time for health care systems and the general public to prepare and to develop timely diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. Finally, although the improvement of internet communication enhances information dissemination, it also has the potential to spread misinformation. Hence, we need to educate the public to follow information from a reliable website such as the CDC in the US. There are several unanswered questions at present in the management of COVID-19. Even though several case studies, RCTs and systemic reviews were done, there is no clarity regarding the exact pathogenesis of the disease, duration of shedding of virus and the possibility of other contaminant viral infections including influenza as well as secondary bacterial infections. The pandemics like COVID-19 put stress on every part of society, posing significant treat to international health and the economy. Several vaccines and promising treatments are being tested on clinical trials. However, the rising number of infected people, as well as mortality from it and the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 with a prolonged incubation period and asymptomatic carriers shredding the virus, makes it challenging to contain the spread. At present, handwashing, isolating and quarantine patients who are exposed or infected with the virus, disinfecting the contaminated surfaces as well as extensive public health measures such as avoiding large group meetings, closure of schools, restricting travel are being implemented by different countries to curb the spread of this virus. Hopefully, we develop an effective vaccine and treatment as soon as possible. Continued clinical trials are required to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 to tackle the disease better and to decrease morbidity and mortality.",
