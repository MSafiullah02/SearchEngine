Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay and neutralization (NT) assay were performed according to standard protocols.27 Seropositive threshold was defined as an HAI antibody titer of 40,28 or a neutralizing antibody titer of 20.29 A non-reactive titer was defined as a value of \u226410.

Previous studies have reported that patients with A(H7N9) virus infection have lower neutralizing antibody titers than HAI antibody titers, and neutralizing antibody titers are lower in A(H7N9) patients compared to A(H5N1) patients.30, 31, 31 We also observed lower neutralizing antibody titers compared to HAI antibody titers in this study. We used a random intercept linear model with B-spline to analyze the dynamics of HAI antibody responses and neutralizing antibody responses over time in sera of A(H7N9) virus-infected patients. Degree and knots of B-spline were selected based on Akaike information criterion (AIC).

We estimated that mean A(H7N9) virus-specific HAI antibody titers peaked three months after illness onset and remained above 80 for 11 months. Severely ill patients mounted higher antibody responses during hospitalization that persisted for a long period after recovery. Therefore, studies of convalescent plasma treatment for A(H7N9) patients should consider collection of donor plasma from survivors of severe disease between 1 and 11 months after illness onset.",

In the study by Ma et al., 2 of 25 patients did not have an HAI antibody titer \u226540 during hospitalization or after recovery.20 Therefore, most, but not all patients with A(H7N9) virus infection who survive severe disease are able to mount detectable HAI antibody levels. The differences in peak time of HAI antibody titers between analyses of GMTs and model analysis might be due to inadequate sampling. The contacts of these virologically-confirmed cases were not investigated by serology in this study. No patient had serologic evidence of A(H7N9) virus re-infection after recovery. Epidemiological investigations of patients who survived A(H7N9) virus infections across five epidemics by our group also found no reoccurrence of A(H7N9) related-illness1; re-infection of A(H7N9) virus has not been reported in other longitudinal sero-epidemiology studies.35\n,\n36\n",

However, there might be antigen-specific differences in HAI titers, which could affect the results. We adopted two statistical approaches to investigate this question: (1) we evaluated the main effect and interactive effect of each antigen in the model and found that the effects were not statistically significant; (2) we constructed the model with the HAI results for A/Anhui/1/2013 virus only, with the same formula and knots as the model for pooled analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7). Before 7 months after illness onset, the trend of the average curve of the A/Anhui/1/2013 virus-only model was similar to that of the model with pooled results, and subsequently the former curve decreased slower than the later one. However, due to the lack of sera available between 14 months and 65 months after illness onset for testing in the A/Anhui/1/2013 virus-only model, we viewed the model with pooled data to be more reliable. We did not find that antigen-specific differences in HAI responses affected the model significantly, but this could be due to small sample size and additional investigations are needed when more data are available for the different antigens.",

Zhang et al. reported increase of neutralizing antibody response within 2 weeks from illness onset by using a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay.34 However, results of pseudovirus-based neutralization assay might not correlate well with results of an authentic virus-based neutralization test.41 In the study by Guo et al., no neutralizing antibodies were detected in samples collected before day 28 after illness onset, which is consistent with our findings.31 Ma et al. also observed delayed neutralizing antibody response after infection, with GMTs increasing overtime, peaking on day 200.20 We observed discordance in H7N9 virus HAI and neutralizing antibody responses with the HAI antibody response decreasing after a peak at 3 months while the neutralizing antibody response increased long after clinical recovery. The correlation of HAI and neutralizing antibody responses varied by A(H7N9) virus antigen, with greater correlation for the more recent A/Hong Kong/125/2017 virus compared with the older antigenically distinct A/Anhui/1/2013 virus. A(H7N9) vaccines induce comparable levels of HA-reactive IgG antibody as seasonal influenza vaccines in mice, but neutralizing titers are low, suggesting a large component of the induced antibody response is non-neutralizing42; this phenomenon might be attributed to the internal genes of A(H7N9) virus.32 Nevertheless, both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies induced by A(H7N9) vaccination of humans protected mice in vivo against a stringent lethal challenge.43 Therefore, neutralizing antibody titers may underestimate the protective effect of antibody responses following A(H7N9) virus infection.",

Collecting blood from survivors of severe illness from A(H7N9) virus infection at 1 to 11 months after illness onset should yield convalescent plasma with HAI antibody titer above 80, suitable for convalescent plasma therapy and H-IVIG production. Among the patients enrolled in this study, 64% (18/28) of the severely ill survivors were aged 18\u201365 years old, making them suitable potential blood donors for plasma therapy.54 Another potential source of convalescent plasma is from participants in clinical trials of A(H7N9) vaccines.55 However, since A(H7N9) viruses continue to evolve into antigenically distinct strains, regardless of the source of the plasma, it will be important to determine the levels of cross-reactive antibodies in the convalescent plasma against a patient's virus infection to understand whether treatment is likely to be beneficial. Furthermore, administration of convalescent plasma treatment for patients with A(H7N9) virus infection should ideally be done through a controlled clinical trial.",

The magnitude and kinetics of the antibody responses in patients with milder illness or asymptomatic infections might be different. Second, clinical data were not available for all patients during their hospitalization, which might impact some analyses. Third, we were not able to collect serial serum specimens from patients during hospitalization and were limited to testing remaining available sera. Survivors were not all followed up at the same designated time points. Fourth, we did not have respiratory specimens to characterize the A(H7N9) viruses that infected the patients, or to determine viral load, duration of shedding and associations with disease severity and antibody responses. Finally, the A(H7N9) patients followed up in this study may not be representative of all survivors of A(H7N9) virus infection in China; however, we included patients from 6 provinces and from 3 epidemics since 2013.",
