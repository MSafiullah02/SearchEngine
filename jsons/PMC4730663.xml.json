The pipiens form requires a blood meal for egg development (anautogeny), prefers to feed on birds (ornitophylic) and enters into diapause during the winter (heterodynamic). By contrast, the molestus form typically lays a first batch of eggs without a blood meal (autogeny), readily feeds on mammals (mamophylic) and remains active yearlong (homodynamic). Remarkably, the molestus form commonly adopts underground habitats in colder temperate climate regions and can mate in confined spaces (stenogamy), whereas the pipiens form colonizes above-ground habitats exclusively and mates in large, open areas (eurygamy) [1].",

The absence of morphological differences in females and the presence of hybrids make it quite difficult to identify these taxa. Several molecular tools have been developed to differentiate species and forms of the Cx. pipiens complex [16\u201319]. These molecular analyses have also detected recurrent hybridization among Cx. pipiens s.l. members where their distribution overlaps, as exemplified by the hybrid populations of Cx.pipiens and Cx.quinquefasciatus mentioned above. Hybrids between the forms pipiens and molestus have also been detected in the United States [6], Portugal [20], Netherlands [21], Greece [22] and Morocco [23], although in cases such as the Netherlands, confirmation of these results should be obtained due to possible presence of Cx. torrentium. Hybridization in the Cx. pipiens complex may change the vectorial capacity of mosquitoes, increasing the vector efficiency of resulting hybrids, which are therefore called bridge vectors [6, 24]. In this context, the analysis of the genetic structure of mosquito populations sheds light on the processes taking place.",

This can potentially result in reproductive isolation between host populations. Five distinct Wolbachia groups (wPip), that are closely related evolutionarily, have been documented in mosquito\u2019s complex Culex pipiens [32]. These wPip groups show different incompatibility status [33, 34]. Wolbachia and host mitochondria are co-transmitted in the egg cytoplasm, constituting valuable markers, and the association between wPip and mtDNA groups was determined [32]. A recent study [35] found that cytoplasmic introgression could be mediated by the maternally-inherited bacterium Wolbachia pipientis: mtDNA and wPip are associated with regular co-transmissions between Cx. pipiens members through hybridization events across the complex. Moreover, conflicting evidence has been given regarding the interference of the Wolbachia symbionts on the vector competence to arboviruses [36, 37].",

The collection comprised the two main members of the complex, Cx.quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens with the two forms pipiens and molestus of which 225 individuals from 20 populations were studied for mtDNA diversity for the first time, and 355 samples from 15 populations that had been studied earlier [13, 38, 39], yielding a total of 580 specimens from 35 populations. Thus, all 580 specimens were processed for discrimination at taxa level and typed at COI locus haplotype (Table 1), whilst a subset of 274 samples were studied at wPip and nuclear loci (Table 3), and 24 were fully sequenced de novo for COI mtDNA and analyzed for phylogenetic relationship jointly with another 24 sequences previously obtained [40].",

The 5\u2032 region of the COI gene of 603 bp was amplified using primers CulexCOIF and CulexCOIR [25]. PCR conditions were the following: primary denaturing \u2013 5 min at 94\u00b0\u0421; 35 cycles: denaturing at 94\u00b0\u0421 \u2013 30 s, annealing at 55\u00b0\u0421 \u2013 30 s, synthesis at 72\u00b0\u0421 \u2013 40 s; final synthesis at 72\u00b0\u0421 \u2013 10 min. HaeIII digestion of the COI PCR products allowed the discrimination of D haplotype from A, B, C and E haplotypes [25, 43]. However, HaeIII has no recognition site for GG\u2019CC on the COI sequence of type D and PCR-product of amplification remains unchanged, 603 bp, whereas the COI fragment of other types resulted in two fragments - 397 and 206 bp respectively (Additional file 1A) - after restriction with HaeIII. After digestion with AluI, the COI PCR-products of A, B, C and D types resulted in 8 fragments (189, 171, 99, 67, 45, 15, 12, 5 bp), 5 of which are visible by electrophoresis in a 2 % agarose gel. The COI fragment of type E and E1 is cut into 7 fragments (189, 171, 144, 67, 15, 12, 5 bp) only because the mutation at position 206 (Fig. 1) inactivates the AluI restriction site (AG\u2019CT). Consequently, the 144 bp fragment is diagnostic for haplotypes E and E1 allowing their discrimination (Additional file 1B). Reactions were carried out in a restriction mixture consisting of 5 \u03bcl COI PCR product, 0.2 \u03bcl (2 units) of the enzyme, 3 \u03bcl buffer, 0.3 \u03bcl BSA and 21.5 \u03bcl ddH2O. Both HaeIII and AluI restriction mixtures were incubated for 2 hours at 37 \u00b0C. At least two technical replicates were performed. Results were visualized by electrophoresis in a 2 % agarose gel. As it is not known whether or not the insectary lines descended from one or more female founders, mtDNA polymorphisms were studied for 10\u201320 individuals per population.",

After digestion of the pk1 PCR products with endonuclease TaqI, three alleles were obtained: a/e (903, 430 bp), c (851, 498 bp) and d (497, 251, 107 bp). The alleles a and e of pk1 gene have the same fragment sizes and therefore needed additional treatment of the pk1 PCR products by restriction endonuclease PstI, resulting in two alleles: a (903, 303, 141 bp) and e (903, 430 bp). After this additional digestion with PstI, alleles a, c and d of the pk1 gene were obtained. According to Atyame and coauthors (2011) [32], different alleles of pk1 and ank2 genes correspond to one of five groups, wPip-I to wPip-V.",

The discrepancy in the results of the analysis based on ACE and CQ11 loci were also obtained in samples from Kos, Greece [13]. Such cases indicate recombination processes in the hybrid population and CQ11 hybrids from these collections are likely to be regarded as hybrids between Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus rather than hybrids between pipiens and molestus (11 samples in Tanger and 22 samples in Kos, total 33 in Table 4).",

Similarly, haplotype E1 is likely derived from haplotype E and both are transmitted in association with the wPipI infection, so we named them haplogroup E. The only other haplotype we detected was haplotype D, which is linked with wPipIV infection. Thus, we have identified three groups of mitochondrial haplotypes of COI gene that are associated, respectively, with three groups of symbiotic bacteria in Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes, similar with polymorphism of W. pipientis and groups of mitochondrial haplotypes of cytB [35].",

Variability in COI gene is very low, but nevertheless, fixed nucleotide substitutions that can distinguish the complex members in allopatric populations were found. Statistically significant correlation between COI haplogroup/type and taxa has been observed also in sympatric populations after the confirmation of taxonomy status by CQ11 assay (Tables 3 and 4). It has been shown that CQ11 assay can produce misleading results in identification of Culex pipiens complex members and should not be the single method to be used [26]. Discrepancies of the CQ11 results with taxonomy status of Cx. pipiens have been identified in other studies [47, 48]. Although many authors made conclusions based on the use of only one marker - CQ11 [21, 23] we used this method in combination with other nuclear marker ACE2 and two cytoplasmic markers - COI and wPip. The use of these markers in conjunction has enabled us not only to clarify the taxonomic status of the individual, but also to discover hybrids between Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus previously unknown to the Mediterranean region, which were confirmed by sequencing of ACE2 gene and finding individuals with both alleles.",

The distribution of this mtDNA diversity appeared to have some degree of spatial structure as mtDNA haplogroup A and haplotype D occured both in northern European and Mediterranean populations, whereas haplogroup E was found exclusively in Mediterranean and Indian populations (Fig. 3). E/E1 were the only haplotypes to be found in Portugal, on the Greek islands, in Israel and in India.

It has also been detected in France and Serbia [27], as well as England [26] and in laboratory colony in Turkey [48]. The identical COI nucleotide sequences found in Cx.pipiens form molestus from such different locations, furthermore supported by the phylogenetic analysis, favors the assumption of a unique mutation in this gene and the subsequent migration of mosquitoes, rather than the hypothesis of molestus populations arising from neighboring, or sympatric, pipiens populations in northern European countries [50]. The haplotype D was found also in specimens from open above ground habitats in Italy, Tunisia, and Morocco, in a total of 4 populations. In the latter cases, the ovarian status of females (autogeny/anautogeny) was not determined and the taxonomic status of these specimens based on CQ11 assay varies: they are characterized as pipiens or molestus forms, and hybrids (Table 3). All individuals with haplotype D were infected with wPipIV. The presence of hybrids in the southern populations is consistent with the hypothesis of less reproductive isolation between pipiens and molestus forms in southern latitudes compared to the northern region [1, 20]. There has been evidence that gene flow between the two forms of Cx. pipiens is limited in Russia [38], Germany [51] and the US [52]. Nevertheless, using microsatellite analyses hybrids between pipiens and molestus in Palearctic have been detected in Portugal [20], Greece [24], Germany [53] and by CQ11 assay in Morocco [23]. However, the percentage of hybrid individuals in the northern countries was much less than in the southern. Hybrids between pipiens and molestus have also been found in the US, but there is sufficient evidence that the US molestus genetically differs from European [54]. Hybridization is probably responsible for the absence of any strict correlation between COI haplotype and taxa within the complex.",

Cx. pipiens with E and E1 haplotypes were also found in coastal areas of Italy, Portugal, Greece, Israel and Morocco (Fig. 3). Random importation of Cx. quinquefasciatus and crossing with local Cx. pipiens may have resulted in the generation of hybrid populations, as we discovered on the Greek island of Kos [13] and in Tanger, Morocco (this work). Such is the case in the hybrid zone between the 30\u00b0 and 40\u00b0 parallels in North America [5, 7, 8, 14], and in Argentina [10] proving the absence of crossing barriers between Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens.

However, its bootstrap values were only significant between haplotypes E/E1 and D. Despite the fact that a strong association was observed between COI haplotype and taxa, the variability in COI gene is low, also evidenced by the low Parsimony informative sites, already detected in members of Cx. pipiens s.l. [40], therefore COI gene may not be the better marker to infer the evolutionary relationship of such close taxa and more polymorphic markers or a multilocus analysis might be more informative. However, higher variability was detected when Cx. torrentium and Cx. pipiens s.l. were compared [40]. On the other hand, absence of significant differences within polymorphic haplogroups A and E, may indicate their evolutionary proximity and that mutations, distinguishing these haplotypes, occurred after the divergence of lines infected with a certain type of bacteria. Further studies on larger samples may also shed light on this issue.",

Previous investigations examining either microsatellites [20] or the mtDNA cytb gene and Wolbachia polymorphism [35] also support frequent hybridization events within the Cx.pipiens complex in the Mediterranean Basin. Thus, by contrast with Northern Europe, similar mtDNA haplotypes are found in different Cx.pipiens taxa in the Mediterranean region. Our understanding of the contribution of cytoplasmic inheritance remains inadequate. Mosquitoes with hybrid features may vary from the parental forms in their competence for the transmission of pathogens. The absence of Cx. pipiens with haplotypes from group E in northern temperate climates could hypothetically point to different population origins, with possible interference in their physiology, of which they could be an indicator. Mosquitoes with haplotypes from group E may have obtained cytoplasmic genes from Cx. quinquefasciatus that feeds readily on birds and mammals and is an extremely efficient vector of encephalitis viruses, including West Nile Virus, Rift Valley Fever Virus, and is also responsible for transmitting the filarial nematode, Wuchereria bancrofti (Cosmotropical areas) [58] and is therefore more medically important than Cx. pipiens. A catholic feeding behavior of hybrids has often been associated with a higher potential for transmitting arbovirus [6]. The evidence presented in this paper requires further study to concomitantly examine the genetic structure of the population, the associations with biologically important behaviors and the vector competence of Cx. pipiens from different populations and from various areas in the Mediterranean region and in other regions where distribution of complex members can overlap.",

These cases of hybridization can change the properties of vectors due to the genetic contribution of the more antropophylic Cx. quinquefasciatus. The analysis of the genetic structure of mosquito populations sheds light on the processes taking place, increasing the understanding of the epidemiology of the diseases these mosquitoes transmit, essential for the improvement of prevention and control policies of these diseases.
