The chemistry and structures of virus genomes are more varied than any of those seen in the entire bacterial, plant, or animal kingdoms. The nucleic acid making up the genome may be single stranded or double stranded, and it may have a linear, circular, or segmented structure. Single-stranded virus genomes may be either positive-sense (i.e., the same polarity or nucleotide sequence as the mRNA), negative-sense, or ambisense (a mixture of the two). Virus genomes range in size from approximately 2,500 nucleotides (nt) (e.g., the Geminivirus tobacco yellow dwarf virus at 2,580 nt of single-stranded DNA) to 2.8 million base pairs of double-stranded DNA in the case of Pandoravirus, which is nearly five times as large as the smallest bacterial genome (e.g., Mycoplasma genitalum at 580,000 bp). Some of the simpler bacteriophages are well-studied examples of the smallest and least complex genomes. At the other end of the scale, the genomes of the largest double-stranded DNA viruses such as herpesviruses and poxviruses are sufficiently complex to have escaped complete functional analysis yet, even though the complete nucleotide sequences of the genomes of a large number of examples have been known for many years.",

Because viruses are obligate intracellular parasites only able to replicate inside the appropriate host cells, the genome must contain information encoded in a way that can be recognized and decoded by the particular type of host cell. The genetic code used by the virus must match or at least be recognized by the host organism. Similarly, the control signals that direct the expression of virus genes must be appropriate to the host. Many of the DNA viruses of eukaryotes closely resemble their host cells in terms of the biology of their genomes. Chapter 4 describes the ways in which virus genomes are replicated, and Chapter 5 deals in more detail with the mechanisms that regulate the expression of virus genetic information. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the diversity of virus genomes and to consider how and why this variation may have arisen.",

This raises an important point. The conventional view is that prokaryote genomes are smaller and replicate faster than those of eukaryotes and hence can be regarded as \u201cstreamlined.\u201d The genome of phage T4 consists of 160 kbp of double-stranded DNA and is highly compressed, for example, promoters and translation control sequences are nested within the coding regions of overlapping upstream genes. The presence of introns in bacteriophage genomes, which are under constant ruthless pressure to exclude \u201cjunk sequences,\u201d suggests that these genetic elements must have evolved mechanisms to escape or neutralize this pressure and to persist as parasites within parasites. All virus genomes experience pressure to minimize their size. Viruses with prokaryotic hosts must be able to replicate sufficiently quickly to keep up with their host cells, and this is reflected in the compact nature of many (but not all) bacteriophages. Overlapping genes are common, and the maximum genetic capacity is compressed into the minimum genome size. In viruses with eukaryotic hosts there is also pressure on genome size. Here, however, the pressure is mainly from the packaging size of the virus particle (i.e., the amount of nucleic acid that can be incorporated into the virion). Therefore, these viruses commonly show highly compressed genetic information when compared with the low density of information in eukaryotic cellular genomes.",

The genome of Mimivirus, at approximately 1.2 Mbp, contains around 1,200 open reading frames (ORFs), only 10% of which show any similarity to proteins of known function. Among viruses of eukaryotes, herpesviruses and poxviruses also have relatively large genomes, up to 235 kbp. It is notable that these virus genomes contain many genes involved in their own replication, particularly enzymes concerned with nucleic acid metabolism. These viruses partially escape the restrictions imposed by the biochemistry of the host cell by encoding additional biochemical equipment. The penalty is that they have to encode all the information necessary for a large and complex particle to package the genome\u2014which is also an upward pressure on genome size. Later sections of this chapter contain detailed descriptions of both small, compact and large, complex virus genomes.Box 3.1It\u2019s Not the Size of Your Genome that Counts, it\u2019s What You Do with itTraditionally it was thought that virus genomes were smaller than bacterial genomes. Often that is true, but not always. So does having a bigger genome make a better virus? Not in my opinion. As discussed in this chapter, some virus genomes are as complex as bacterial genomes, and larger than some of the smaller ones. This means they have nearly the same capabilities as bacteria\u2014but not quite. No virus genome contains all the genes needed to make ribosomes, so in the end they are still parasites. Personally, my admiration goes to those stripped down miniature marvels which contain only a handful of genes and yet still manage to take over a cell and replicate themselves successfully.

DNA virus genomes can be analyzed directly by restriction endonuclease digestion without resorting to molecular cloning, and this approach was achieved for the first time with SV40 DNA in 1971. The first pieces of DNA to be molecularly cloned were restriction fragments of bacteriophage \u03bb DNA which were cloned into the DNA genome of SV40 by Berg and colleagues in 1972. This means that virus genomes were both the first cloning vectors and the first nucleic acids to be analyzed by these techniques.

RNA sequence analysis did not begin to advance rapidly until the widespread use of reverse transcriptase (isolated from retroviruses) to convert RNA into cDNA in the 1970s.

Direct analysis by electron microscopy, if calibrated with known standards, can be used to estimate the size of nucleic acid molecules. Hybridization of complementary nucleotide sequences can also be used in a number of ways to analyze virus genomes (Chapter 1). Perhaps the most important single technique has been gel electrophoresis (Figure 3.1\n). The earliest gel matrix employed for separating molecules was based on starch and gave relatively poor resolution. It is now most common to use agarose gels to separate large nucleic acid molecules, which may be very large indeed\u2014several megabases (million base pairs) in the case of techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to separate smaller pieces (down to sizes of a few nucleotides). Apart from the fact that sequencing depends on the ability to separate molecules that differ from each other by only one nucleotide in length, gel electrophoresis has been of great value in analyzing intact virus genomes, particularly the analysis of viruses with segmented genomes. The most recent and most powerful sequence analysis techniques have done away with electrophoresis and rely on light detection from fluorescent compounds.",

This is because positive-sense vRNA is essentially mRNA, and the first event in a normally infected cell is to translate the vRNA to make the virus proteins responsible for genome replication. In this case, direct introduction of RNA into cells circumvents the earliest stages of the replicative cycle (Chapter 4). Virus genomes that are composed of double-stranded DNA are also infectious. The events that occur here are a little more complex, as the virus genome must first be transcribed by host polymerases to produce mRNA. This is relatively simple for phage genomes introduced into prokaryotes, but for viruses that replicate in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, such as herpesviruses, the DNA must first find its way to the appropriate cellular compartment. Most of the DNA that is introduced into cells by transfection is degraded by cellular nucleases. However, irrespective of its sequence, a small proportion of the newly introduced DNA finds its way into the nucleus, where it is transcribed by cellular polymerases.",

This is presumably because the DNA is transcribed by cellular enzymes to make RNA. Synthetic RNA transcribed in vitro from the cDNA template of the genome is much more efficient at initiating infection. Such experiments are referred to as \u201creverse genetics\u201d\u2014that is, the manipulation of a virus via a cloned intermediate. Using these techniques, virus can be rescued from cloned genomes, including those that have been manipulated in vitro. Originally, this type of approach was not possible for analysis of viruses with negative-sense genomes. This is because all negative-sense virus particles contain a virus-specific polymerase. The first event when these virus genomes enter the cell is that the negative-sense genome is copied by the polymerase, forming either positive-sense transcripts that are used directly as mRNA or a double-stranded molecule, known either as the replicative intermediate or replicative form, which serves as a template for further rounds of mRNA synthesis. Therefore, because purified negative-sense genomes cannot be directly translated by the host cell and are not replicated in the absence of the virus polymerase, these genomes are inherently noninfectious. However, systems have now been developed that permit the rescue of viruses with negative-sense genomes from purified or cloned nucleic acids. All such systems rely on a ribonucleoprotein complex that can serve as a template for genome replication by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, but they fall into one of two approaches:\u25aa\nIn vitro complex formation: Virus proteins purified from infected cells are mixed with RNA transcribed from cloned cDNAs to form complexes which are then introduced into susceptible cells to initiate an infection. This method has been used for paramyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, and bunyaviruses.\u25aa\nIn vivo complex formation: Ribonucleoprotein complexes formed in vitro are introduced into cells infected with a helper virus strain.

In some viruses, mutation rates may be as high as 10\u22123 to 10\u22124 per incorporated nucleotide (e.g., in retroviruses such as HIV), whereas in others they may be as low as 10\u22128 to 10\u221211 (e.g., in herpesviruses), which is similar to the mutation rates seen in cellular DNA. These differences are due to the mechanism of genome replication, with error rates in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases generally being higher than DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. Some RNA virus polymerases do have proofreading functions, but in general mutation rates are higher in most RNA viruses than in DNA viruses. For a virus, mutations are a mixed blessing. The ability to generate antigenic variants that can escape the immune response is a clear advantage, but mutation also results in many defective particles, as most mutations are deleterious. In the most extreme cases (e.g., HIV), the error rate is 10\u22123 to 10\u22124 per nucleotide incorporated. The HIV genome is approximately 9.7 kb long; therefore, there will be 0.9\u20139.7 mutations in every genome copied. Hence, in this case, the wild-type virus actually consists of a fleeting majority type that dominates the dynamic equilibrium (i.e., the population of genomes) present in all cultures of the virus. These mixtures of molecular variants are known as quasispecies and also occur in other RNA viruses (e.g., picornaviruses). However, the majority of these variants will be noninfectious or seriously disadvantaged and are therefore rapidly weeded out of a replicating population. This mechanism is an important force in virus evolution (see \u201cThe Virome\u2014Evolution and Epidemiology\u201d). Historically, most genetic analysis of viruses has been performed on virus mutants isolated from mutagen-treated populations. Currently, defined and highly specific mutations in particular genes or control sequences (e.g., single nucleotide changes) are usually introduced using molecular methods such as PCR.

            "text": "The disadvantage of determining nucleotide sequences as a primary tool for studying viruses is that the sequence alone frequently says little about the function of gene beyond what can be guessed from comparisons with similar genes in other organisms. To understand how the virus actually works functional analysis is required and this is where mutations, whether naturally occurring or artificially introduced, are valuable. The phenotype of a mutant virus depends on the type of mutation(s) it has and also upon the location of the mutation(s) within the genome. Each of the classes of mutations can occur naturally in viruses or may be artificially induced for experimental purposes:\u25aa\nBiochemical markers: These include drug resistance mutations, mutations that result in altered virulence, polymorphisms resulting in altered electrophoretic mobility of proteins or nucleic acids, and altered sensitivity to inactivating agents.\u25aa\nDeletions: Similar in some ways to nonsense mutants (below) but may include one or more virus genes and involve noncoding control regions of the genome (promoters, etc.). Spontaneous deletion mutants often accumulate in virus populations as defective-interfering (DI) particles. These noninfectious but not necessarily genetically inert genomes are thought to be important in establishing the course and pathogenesis of certain virus infections (see Chapter 6). Genetic deletions can only revert to wild-type by recombination, which usually occurs at comparatively low frequencies. Deletion mutants are very useful for assigning structure\u2013function relationships to virus genomes, as they are easily mapped by physical analysis.\u25aa\nHost range: This term can refer either to whole animal hosts or to permissive cell types in vitro. Conditional mutants of this class have been isolated using amber-suppressor cells (mostly for phages but also for animal viruses using in vitro systems).\u25aa\nNonsense: These result from alteration of coding sequence of a protein to one of three translation stop codons (UAG, amber; UAA, ocher; UGA, opal). Translation is terminated, resulting in the production of an amino-terminal fragment of the protein. The phenotype of these mutations can be suppressed by propagation of virus in a cell (bacterial or, more recently, animal) with altered suppressor tRNAs. Nonsense mutations are rarely \u201cleaky\u201d (i.e., the normal function of the protein is completely obliterated) and can only revert to wild-type at the original site, so they usually have a low reversion frequency.\u25aa\nPlaque morphology: Mutants may be either large-plaque mutants which replicate more rapidly than the wild-type, or small-plaque mutants, which are the opposite. Plaque size is often related to a temperature-sensitive (t.s.) phenotype. These mutants are often useful as unselected markers in multifactorial crosses.\u25aa\nTemperature-sensitive (t.s.): This type of mutation is very useful as it allows the isolation of conditional-lethal mutations, a powerful means of examining virus genes that are essential for replication and whose function cannot otherwise be interrupted. Temperature-sensitive mutations usually result from mis-sense mutations in proteins (i.e., amino acid substitutions), resulting in proteins of full size with subtly altered conformation that can function at (permissive) low temperatures but not at (nonpermissive) higher ones. Generally, the mutant proteins are immunologically unaltered, which is frequently useful. These mutations are usually \u201cleaky\u201d\u2014that is, some of the normal activity is retained even at nonpermissive temperatures. Protein function is often impaired, even at permissive temperatures, therefore a high frequency of reversion is often a problem with this type of mutation because the wild-type virus replicates faster than the mutant.\u25aa\nCold-sensitive (c.s.): These mutants are the opposite of temperature-sensitive mutants and are very useful in bacteriophages and plant viruses whose host cells can be propagated at low temperatures but are less useful for animal viruses because their host cells generally will not grow at significantly lower temperatures than normal.\u25aa\nRevertants: Reverse mutation is a valid type of mutation in its own right. Most of the above classes can undergo reverse mutation, which may be either simple \u201cback mutations\u201d (i.e., correction of the original mutation) or second-site \u201ccompensatory mutations,\u201d which may be physically distant from the original mutation and not even necessarily in the same gene as the original mutation.\u25aa\nSuppression: Suppression is the inhibition of a mutant phenotype by a second suppressor mutation, which may be either in the virus genome or in that of the host cell. This mechanism of suppression is not the same as the suppression of chain-terminating amber mutations by host-encoded suppressor tRNAs, which could be called \u201cinformational suppression.\u201d Genetic suppression results in an apparently wild-type phenotype from a virus which is still genetically mutant\u2014a pseudorevertant. This phenomenon has been best studied in prokaryotic systems, but examples have been discovered in animal viruses\u2014for example, reoviruses, vaccinia, and influenza\u2014where suppression has been observed in an attenuated vaccine, leading to an apparently virulent virus. Suppression may also be important biologically in that it allows viruses to overcome the deleterious effects of mutations and therefore be positively selected.\n",

In this situation, one of the viruses in a mixed infection provides a functional gene product for another virus which is defective for that function (Figure 3.2\n). If both mutants are defective in the same function, enhancement of replication does not occur and the two mutants are said to be in the same complementation group. The importance of this test is that it allows functional analysis of unknown mutations if the biochemical basis of any one of the mutations in a particular complementation group is known. In theory, the number of complementation groups is equal to the number of genes in the virus genome. In practice, there are usually fewer complementation groups than genes, as mutations in some genes are always lethal and other genes are nonessential and therefore cannot be scored in this type of test. Complementation can be asymmetric\u2014that is, only one of the mutant viruses is able to replicate. This can be an absolute or a partial restriction. When complementation occurs naturally, it is usually the case that a replication-competent wild-type virus rescues a replication-defective mutant. In these cases, the wild-type is referred to as a \u201chelper virus,\u201d such as in the case of defective transforming retroviruses containing oncogenes (see Figure 3.3\nand Chapter 7). Recombination is the physical interaction of virus genomes during superinfection that results in gene combinations not present in either parent. There are three mechanisms by which this can occur, depending on the organization of the virus genome:\u25aa\nIntramolecular recombination via strand breakage and religation: This process occurs in all DNA viruses and in RNA viruses that replicate via a DNA intermediate. It is believed to be caused by cellular enzymes, as no virus mutants with specific recombination defects have been isolated.\u25aa\nIntramolecular recombination by \u201ccopy-choice\u201d: This process occurs in RNA viruses, probably by a mechanism in which the virus polymerase switches template strands during genome synthesis. There are cellular enzymes that could be involved (e.g., splicing enzymes), but this is unlikely and the process is thought to occur essentially as a random event. Defective-interfering (DI) particles in RNA virus infections are frequently generated in this way (see Chapter 6).\u25aa\nReassortment: In viruses with segmented genomes, the genome segments can be randomly shuffled during superinfection. Progeny viruses receive (at least) one of each of the genome segments, but probably not from a single parent. For example, influenza virus has eight genome segments; therefore, in a mixed infection, there could be 28=256 possible progeny viruses. Packaging mechanisms in these viruses are not well understood (see Chapter 2) but may be involved in generating reassortants.\n",

In reassortment, the frequency of recombination between two markers is either very high (indicating that the markers are on two different genome segments) or comparatively low (which means that they are on the same segment).

Among viruses, only retroviruses are truly diploid, with two complete copies of the entire genome, but some DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, have repeated sequences and are therefore partially heterozygous. In a few (mostly enveloped) viruses, aberrant packaging of multiple genomes may occasionally result in multiploid particles that are heterozygous (e.g., up to 10% of Newcastle disease virus particles).

Subsequent generations of viruses inherit and display the original parental phenotypes. This process can occur easily in viruses with naked capsids (nonenveloped) which are closely related (e.g., different strains of enteroviruses) or in enveloped viruses, which need not be related to one another (Figure 3.4\n). In this latter case, the phenomenon is due to the nonspecific incorporation of different virus glycoproteins into the envelope, resulting in a mixed phenotype. Rescue of replication-defective transforming retroviruses by a helper virus is a form of pseudotyping. Phenotypic mixing has proved to be a very useful tool to examine biological properties of viruses. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) readily forms pseudotypes containing retrovirus envelope glycoproteins, giving a plaque-forming virus with the properties of VSV but with the cell tropism of the retrovirus.

In the case of phage \u03bb, the substrate packaged into the phage heads during assembly consists of long repetitive strings (concatemers) of phage DNA that are produced during the later stages of genome replication. The DNA is reeled in by the phage head, and when a complete genome length has been incorporated, the DNA is cleaved at a specific sequence by a phage-coded endonuclease (Figure 3.5\n). This enzyme leaves a 12-bp 5\u2032 overhang on the end of each of the cleaved strands, known as the cos site. Hydrogen bond formation between these \u201csticky ends\u201d can result in the formation of a circular molecule. In a newly infected cell, the gaps on either side of the cos site are closed by DNA ligase, and it is this circular DNA that undergoes vegetative replication or integration into the bacterial chromosome.

These are cleaved by a specific endonuclease, but unlike the \u03bb genome the lengths of DNA incorporated into the particle are somewhat longer than a complete genome length (Figure 3.6\n).

This has been achieved by the use of both strands of the genome DNA and overlapping genes (Figure 3.8\n). VP1 is encoded by a dedicated ORF, but the VP2 and VP3 genes overlap so that VP3 is contained within VP2. The origin of replication is surrounded by noncoding regions which control transcription.

The family is divided into three subfamilies, based on their nucleotide sequence and biological properties (Table 3.1\n). Herpesviruses have large genomes composed of up to 235 kbp of linear, double-stranded DNA and correspondingly large and complex virus particles containing about 35 virion polypeptides. All encode a variety of enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism, DNA synthesis, and protein processing (e.g., protein kinases). The different members of the family are widely separated in terms of genomic sequence and proteins, but all are similar in terms of structure and genome organization (Figure 3.10A\n). Some but not all herpesvirus genomes consist of two covalently joined sections, a unique long (UL) and a unique short (US) region, each bounded by inverted repeats. The repeats allow structural rearrangements of the unique region. This arrangement allows these genomes to exist as a mixture of four structural isomers, all of which are functionally equivalent (Figure 3.10B). Herpesvirus genomes also contain multiple repeated sequences and, depending on the number of these, the genome size of different isolates of a particular virus can vary by up to 10 kbp. The prototype member of the family is herpes simplex virus (HSV), whose genome consists of approximately\n152 kbp of double-stranded DNA, the complete nucleotide sequence of which has now been determined.

The problem of strand breakage is particularly relevant for single-stranded RNA, which is less chemically stable than double-stranded DNA. The longest single-stranded RNA genomes are those of the coronaviruses at approximately 30 kb, but the longest double-stranded DNA virus genomes are considerably longer (e.g., Pandoravirus at up to 2.8 Mbp). Physical breakage of the genome results in biological inactivation, as it cannot be completely transcribed, translated, or replicated. Segmentation means that the virus avoids \u201chaving all its eggs in one basket\u201d and also reduces the probability of breakages due to shearing, thus increasing the total potential coding capacity of the entire genome. The disadvantage of segmentation is that all the individual genome segments must be packaged into each virus particle or the virus will be defective as a result of loss of genetic information.

The influenza virus genome is composed of eight segments (in influenza A and B strains; seven in influenza C) of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA (Table 3.2\n). The identity of the proteins encoded by each genome segment were determined originally by genetic analysis of the electrophoretic mobility of the individual segments from reassortant viruses and by analysis of a large number of mutants covering all eight segments. The eight segments have common nucleotide sequences at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends (Figure 3.15\n) which are necessary for replication of the genome (Chapter 4). These sequences are complementary to one another, and, inside the particle, the ends of the genome segments are held together by base-pairing and form a panhandle structure that again is believed to be involved in replication. The RNA genome segments are not packaged as naked nucleic acid but in association with the gene 5 product, the nucleoprotein, and are visible in electron micrographs as helical structures. Here there is a paradox. Biochemically and genetically, each genome segment behaves as an individual, discrete entity; however, in electron micrographs of influenza virus particles disrupted with nonionic detergents, the nucleocapsid has the physical appearance of a single, long helix. Clearly, there is some interaction between the genome segments and it is this which explains the ability of influenza virus particles to select and package the genome segments within each particle with a surprisingly low error rate, considering the difficulty of the task (Chapter 2).\n",

Geminiviruses are divided into three genera based on their host plants (monocotyledons or dicotyledons) and insect vectors (leafhoppers or whiteflies). In the Mastrevirus and Curtovirus genera, the genome consists of a single-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 2.7 kb. The DNA packaged into these virions has been arbitrarily designated as positive-sense, although both the positive-sense and negative-sense strands found in infected cells contain protein-coding sequences. The genome of geminiviruses in the genus Begmovirus is bipartite and consists of two circular, single-stranded DNA molecules, each of which is packaged into a separate particle (Figure 3.16\n). Both of the strands comprising the genome are approximately 2.7 kb long and differ from one another completely in nucleotide sequence, except for a shared 200-nt noncoding sequence involved in DNA replication. The two genomic DNAs are packaged into entirely separate capsids. Because a productive infection requires both parts of the genome, it is necessary for a minimum of two virus particles bearing one copy of each of the genome segments to infect a new host cell. Although geminiviruses do not multiply in the tissues of their insect vectors (nonpropagative transmission), a sufficiently large amount of virus is ingested and subsequently deposited onto a new host plant to favor such superinfections.

Bacteriophage Mu infects E. coli and consists of a complex, tailed particle containing a linear, double-stranded DNA genome of about 37 kb, with host-cell-derived sequences of between 0.5 and 2 kbp attached to the right-hand end of the genome (Figure 3.17\n). Mu is a temperate bacteriophage whose replication can proceed through two pathways; one involves integration of the genome into that of the host cell and results in lysogeny, and the other is lytic replication, which results in the death of the cell (see Chapter 5). Integration of the phage genome into that of the host bacterium occurs at random sites in the cell genome. Integrated phage genomes are known as prophage, and integration is essential for the establishment of lysogeny. At intervals in bacterial cells lysogenic for Mu, the prophage undergoes transposition to a different site in the host genome. The mechanism leading to transposition is different from that responsible for the initial integration of the phage genome (which is conservative in that it does not involve replication) and is a complex process requiring numerous phage-encoded and host-cell proteins. Transposition is tightly linked to replication of the phage genome and results in the formation of a \u201cco-integrate\u201d\u2014that is, a duplicate copy of the phage genome flanking a target sequence in which insertion has occurred. The original Mu genome remains in the same location where it first integrated and is joined by a second integrated genome at another site. (Not all prokaryotic transposons use this process; some, such as TN10, are not replicated during transposition but are excised from the original integration site and integrate elsewhere.) There are two consequences of such a transposition. First, the phage genome is replicated during this process (advantageous for the virus), and second, the sequences flanked by the two phage genomes (which form repeated sequences) are at risk of secondary rearrangements, including deletions, inversions, duplications, and translocations (possibly but not necessarily deleterious for the host cell).",

First, it is a highly error-prone process, because reverse transcriptase does not carry\nout the proofreading functions performed by cellular DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. This results in the introduction of many mutations into retrovirus genomes and, consequently, rapid genetic variation. In addition, the process of reverse transcription promotes genetic recombination. Because two RNAs are packaged into each virion and used as the template for reverse transcription, recombination can and does occur between the two strands. Although the mechanism responsible for this is not clear, if one of the RNA strands differs from the other (e.g., by the presence of a mutation) and recombination occurs, then the resulting virus will be genetically distinct from either of the parental viruses.",

The mature products of the pol gene are, in fact, a complex of polypeptides that include three distinct enzymatic activities: reverse transcriptase and RNAse H, which are involved in reverse transcription, and integrase, which catalyzes integration of virus DNA into the host cell chromatin, after which it is known as the provirus (Figure 3.21\n). Three forms of double-stranded DNA are found in retrovirus-infected cells following reverse transcription: linear DNA and two circular forms that contain either one or two LTRs. From the structure at the ends of the provirus, it was previously believed that the two-LTR circle was the form used for integration. In recent years, systems that have been developed to study the integration of retrovirus DNA in vitro show that it is the linear form that integrates. This discrepancy can be resolved by a model in which the ends of the two LTRs are held in close proximity by the reverse transcriptase\u2013integrase complex. The net result of integration is that 1\u20132 bp are lost from the end of each LTR and 4\u20136 bp of cellular DNA are duplicated on either side of the provirus. It is unclear whether there is any specificity regarding the site of integration into the cell genome. What is obvious is that there is no simple target sequence, but it is possible that there may be (numerous) regions or sites in the eukaryotic genome that are more likely to be integration sites than others.",

There are eight genes encoded in this genome, although not all eight products have been detected in infected cells. Replication of the CaMV genome is similar to that of HBV. The first stage is the migration of the gapped virus DNA to the nucleus of the infected cell where it is repaired to form a covalently closed circle. This DNA is transcribed to produce two polyadenylated transcripts, one long (35S) and one shorter (19S). In the cytoplasm, the 19S mRNA is translated to produce a protein that forms large inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and it is in these sites that the second phase of replication occurs. In these replication complexes, some copies of the 35S mRNA are translated while others are reverse transcribed and packaged into virions as they form.

This is particularly true now that we appreciate the plasticity of virus and cellular genomes and the mobility of genetic information from virus to virus, cell to virus, and virus to cell. There is no reason to believe that virus evolution has stopped, and it is dangerous to do so. The practical consequences of ongoing evolution and the concept of emergent viruses are described in Chapter 7.Box 3.3What Do Orders Tell Us about Evolution?When the International Committee on Nomenclature of Viruses was created in 1966, we knew hundreds of viruses but little about most of them. This made it difficult to see how they were related to each other. Eventually it was agreed that some viruses were sufficiently similar to allow them to be grouped together as a genus\u2014in the same way that horses (Equus caballus) are in the same genus as donkeys (Equus asinus). The next step was to group similar genera (plural of genus) together as families. At that point, there was a pause for some years until it was agreed that similar virus families could be grouped into orders, of which seven have now been recognized. This change happened after enough nucleotide sequence data had been accumulated to make the faint evolutionary relationships between distantly related viruses apparent. Why does it matter? In part because this is a window on the past allowing us to look back millions of years through these genetic fossils, but much more importantly because it points to what viruses are capable of and where they might be going in the future.
