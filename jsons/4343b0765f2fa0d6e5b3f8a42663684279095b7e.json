Cytokine storm or macrophage activation syndrome or secondary haemophagocytic lyphohistocytosis has previously been described as a serious complication in other clinical contexts including individuals with rheumatologic disorders such as systemic onset juvenile inflammatory arthritis also known as Still's disease 3 , sepsis 4 , and CAR-T cell therapy 5 . IL-1\u03b2 is one of the key inflammatory cytokines implicated in the cytokine storm syndrome 4, 6, 7 . Inhibition of IL-1\u03b2induced cellular signaling with the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) antagonist, Anakinra, has shown promise in treating cytokine storm and is proposed as a potential therapy for subjects with this severe complication of COVID-19 [8] [9] [10] 11 . Yet, little is known about the immune cell subtypes most vulnerable to IL-1\u03b2induced inflammatory signals in humans. New technologies, such as mass cytometry (CyTOF), have emerged as powerful analytic tools to identify unique cell phenotypes associated with specific inflammatory stimuli and their inhibitors [12] [13] [14] . CyTOF uses antibodies conjugated to isotopes of rareearth metals not found in human cells, so it eliminates background signal and minimizes signal overlap, allowing for the identification of a greater number of proteins that more precisely define cellular identify and activation states. These novel, customized approaches hold promise for the discovery of the cellular mechanisms mediating IL-1\u03b2-induced pathologies and the identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers that could be used to assist in early identification of cytokine storm and those who may response to specific therapies such as IL-1\u03b2 or IL-1R inhibitors.",

            "text": "NF-\u03baB, p38 MAPK, ERK and JNK activation have been implicated in IL-1R1-mediated immune cell activation [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Notably, the majority of these are murine studies. Based on these findings, we developed a customized 35 antibody IL-1\u03b2-response CyTOF panel to generate the first comprehensive atlas of IL-1\u03b2-induced signaling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in humans. Results demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2 rapidly induces p-NF-kB and p-p38 in distinct effector memory (EM) T subsets, monocytes, dendritic cells (DC), natural killer (NK) cells and lineage-(Lin -)CD161 + CD25 + cells. IL-1\u03b2induced increase in p-p38 was much less robust than p-NF-kB. In contrast to the rapid increase of p-NF-kB with only 15 minutes of IL-1\u03b2 stimulation, prolonged stimulation for one hour greatly increased p-STAT3 and to a lesser extent p-STAT1 and p-STAT5 in subsets of T cells, monocytes, DCs and Lin -CD161 + CD25 + cells. Notably, we identified CCR6 as a marker to distinctly identify T cells most responsive to IL-1\u03b2. The IL-1R antagonist Anakinra significantly inhibited IL-1\u03b2-induced p-NF-kB in the CCR6 + T cells and CD11c myeloid DCs (mDC) with only a trending inhibition in CD14 monocytes and Lin -CD161 + CD25 + cells. This knowledge of the cell types, unique markers enriched on responsive cells and temporal expression of inflammatory signaling molecules in response to IL-1\u03b2 stimulation in humans provides unique information that may be used to discover new approaches to limit IL-1\u03b2-induced cytokine storm and other pathologies. Additionally, the heterogeneity in subject response to IL-1\u03b2 suggests that findings could be utilized to identify those most at risk for cytokine storm and those most likely to benefit from IL-1\u03b2 inhibition.",

For titration of phospho signaling antibodies, PBMCs were stimulated with PMA/Ionomycin (50 nM/1 \u00b5g/ml) for 15 minutes. To capture IL-1\u03b2-induced transient signaling, PBMCs needed to be fixed immediately with paraformaldehyde (PFA, 1.6% final concentration) post stimulation. As such, impact of PFA on integrity of surface marker epitopes was evaluated. PFA fixation led to significant loss of CXCR4, CXCR5, CCR6, CCR7 and CD127 staining while increased non-specific binding of CXCR3 (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). As such, an alternative approach was utilized to label cells with these PFA-labile antibodes. A small volume of a cocktail of these PFA-labile antibodies was added simultaneously during IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of PBMCs prior to PFA fixation. Antibody addition during PBMC stimulation did not interfere with IL-1\u03b2-mediated signaling ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , while allowed specific staining. Preliminary analysis did not show expression of p-JNK and ribosomal protein p-S6, an AKT effector upon IL-1\u03b2 stimulation so these markers were excluded from the panel.",

Prior to IL-1\u03b2 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) stimulation, PBMCs were rested in 1.8 ml low retention eppendorf tubes (Fisherbrand) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . At the end of the stimulation period, PFA (1.6% final concentration) methanol free, Ultra Pure EM grade, Polysciences, Inc) was immediately added to the PBMC suspension, mixed by vortexing, and cells were incubated at RT for 10 minutes. PFA was then diluted at least to 0.8% or lower with ice-cold Maxpar Cell Staining Buffer (CSB) (Fluidigm), and fixed cells were centrifuged at 800 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes at RT. PBMC samples were barcoded using the palladium-based 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit (Fluidigm) according to the manufacturer's protocol. As PBMCs were fixed with PFA, which is similar to the Maxpar Fix I Buffer, this step was excluded and cells were washed twice with 1 ml of 1x Maxpar Barcode Perm Buffer. Barcoded cells were then combined into a single tube prior to Fc receptor blocking (BD Biosciences) and staining with a cocktail of metal-conjugated antibodies against cell-surface markers for 30 minutes at RT with frequent gentle shaking. After washing once with the CSB, cells were resuspended in residual CSB and chilled on ice for 5 minutes. For cell permeabilization, 0.5 ml of 100% ice-cold methanol was added to the cells, and samples were vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Eppendorf tubes were filled up with the CSB and samples were centrifuged at 800 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes at RT. An additional wash with the CSB was performed to remove residual methanol prior to staining with antibodies against intracellular phospho markers for 45 minutes at RT. After washing, cell were fixed with 2% PFA for 10 minutes at RT, washed again and cell pellet stored overnight at 4\u00b0C. Next day, stained cells were incubated with iridium DNA intercalator (Fluidigm) in Maxpar Fix and Perm Buffer (Fluidigm) for 20 minutes at RT.

The panel included antibodies to major immune cell types, IL-1Rs and signaling proteins including p-NF-kB, p-p38, p-ERK, p-STAT1, p-STAT3 and p-STAT5. PBMCs from human donors were stimulated with vehicle or IL-1\u03b2 for 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minutes, fixed, barcoded and analyzed by CyTOF with subsequent computational data analysis (Fig. 1b) . PBMCs stimulated with varying doses of IL-1\u03b2 (10, 25 and 100 ng/ml) revealed equivalent responses in terms of expression of p-NF-kB and p-p38 ( Supplementary Fig. 4) , so 10 ng/ml dose was used for all subsequent experiments. To map IL-1\u03b2-induced signaling responses across major immune cell types, Spanning-tree Progression Analysis of Density-normalized Events (SPADE) analysis was applied on all vehicle and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated samples. SPADE analysis identified 9 major immune cell populations including, CD4 + , CD8 + , and CD4 -CD8 low T cells, CD19 + B cells, HLA-DR + CD14 + and HLA-DR + CD16 + monocytes, HLA-DR + CD11c + (mDCs) and HLA-DR + CD123 + plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and HLA-DR -CD56 + CD16 + NK cells (Fig. 1c,d) .

Notably, there was clear variation (5-20%) in IL-1\u03b2-induced expression of p-NF-kB in these T cell subtypes between individuals suggesting that this assay may have the potential to identify individual differences in susceptibility to IL-1\u03b2-induced downstream effects.",

However, mean expression of IL-1R1 was significantly lower in the p-NF-kB + memory T cells in comparison to the p-NF-kBmemory T cells (Fig. 3a) . IL-1\u03b2 signaling can induce receptor internalization 30 yet, there was no reduction in the mean expression of surface IL-1R1 after 15 minutes of IL-1\u03b2 stimulation in both the p-NF-kBand p-NF-kB + memory T cell subsets (Fig.   3a) . Cell surface IL-1R2 binds to IL-1\u03b2 but acts as a decoy receptor 31 . As such, the ratio of the levels of IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 on the cell surface may determine the signaling outcome induced by IL-1\u03b2. Therefore, we also analyzed expression of IL-1R2 on the p-NF-kB + and p-NF-kBmemory T cells. IL-1R2 expression could not be detected on T cells or any other immune cell type in both vehicle-treated and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated PBMCs. Notably, the same IL-1R2 antibody clone measured IL-1R2 expression on CD4 memory T cells activated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and IL-2 for 48 hours. Unstimulated cells in culture also showed moderate levels of IL-1R2 expression, yet it was undetectable on unstimulated freshly purified PBMCs (Supplementary Fig. 8) .",

Yet, unlike lineage markers such as CD4, CD8 and CD45RO, CCR6 median expression was moderate, raising the interesting possibility that there may be a range of CCR6 expression in these T cell subtypes, and that CCR6 may mark those most prone to activation in response to IL-1\u03b2. To test this, we gated total CD3 T cells into CCR6and CCR6 + populations and analyzed expression of p-NF-kB and p-p38 in these subsets. Indeed, remarkably higher frequencies of p-NF-kB + and p-p38 + T cells were present within the T cells that expressed CCR6 as compared to those that do not (Fig. 3b-e) . Moreover, the majority (61.5 \u00b1 2.75%) of the CCR6 + memory T cells that showed IL-1\u03b2-induced expression of p-NF-kB or p-p38 coexpressed CCR2 and CD26 (Fig. 3f) .",

Increased frequency of CD4 EM T cells are associated with increased disease activity and severity [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that T cell intrinsic IL-1R signaling acts as a licensing signal for cytokine production by memory CD4 T cells and that this critical cue is conserved across all EM lineages 17 . IL-1\u03b2 enhanced post-transcriptional stability of effector cytokines such as TH17 cytokines, IL-5 and IL-13 via the p38 MAPK pathway in the murine CD4 EM T cells 17 . Other studies, mostly murine, also demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2 is crucial for proinflammatory cytokine production by CD4 EM T cells through activation of NF-kB, p38 and JNK 15, 16, [18] [19] [20] [21] . Consistent with these studies, our CyTOF analyses in human immune cells demonstrated IL-1\u03b2-induced signaling predominantly in the CD4 EM subsets including TH17, Tfh and MTregs. IL-1\u03b2-induced expression of p-NF-kB was more robust as compared to p-p38 expression. Our data suggests that NF-kB inflammatory pathway may play a more prominent role in IL-1\u03b2-mediated regulation of functions of the CD4 EM T subsets in humans. Murine CD4 + CXCR5 hi CD25 -Tfh cells express IL-1R1, and IL-1\u03b2 triggers in vivo expansion of these Tfh cells and induces production of IL-4 and IL-21, the two major B cell activating cytokines 45 . To our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate that IL-1\u03b2 induces NF-kB activation in the human Tfh cells, potentially providing new mechanistic insight into IL-1\u03b2-mediated dysregulated humoral response in patients with autoimmune diseases 46 .",

CD4 -CD8 + CD161 high T cells with a similar phenotype as the CD4 -CD8 + cells within cluster 8 are present in the human peripheral blood and represent mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells 47-51 . These CD4 -CD8 + CD161 high T cells express reduced levels of CD8 and share phenotypic features with the Th17 cells, including expression of the chemokine receptors (CCR6, CCR2 and CXCR6), cytokine receptors (IL-23R and IL-18R) and RORC transcription factor 47,48,51 . Moreover, the CD4 -CD8 + CD161 high cells belong to the conventional TCR-\u03b1\u03b2 EM (CD45RO + CCR7 -) T cells 47,48 that are not exhausted or terminally differentiated, and a subset of these cells express IL-17, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-22 47,52 . Notably, gating total CD8 T cells following the strategy used by Billerbeck et al. 47 , we were able to distinctly identify the CD161 high cells that expressed relatively lower levels of CD8 (Supplementary Fig. 7e) . Furthermore, the CD4 -CD8 + CD161 high cells in cluster 8 colocalized with the CD8 low CD161 high subset when overlaid on the total CD8 T cells (Supplementary Fig. 7f ). In the present study, we did not measure expression of CXCR6, IL-23R and IL-18R. However, the expression of markers including CCR2, CCR6, CD45RO and CD127 on the CD8 + CD161 high T cells in cluster 8 (Fig. 2c) and absence of CCR7 expression ( Supplementary   Fig. 7g-m) suggests that they may be CD8 + CD161 high MAIT cells as reported earlier 47,48,51 . Further supporting this notion is the study by Turtle et al., which demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2 in cooperation with T cell receptor signaling enhances cell proliferation and IL-17 secretion in human CD8\u03b1 + CD161 high cells 52 . While MAIT cells play an important role in protective immunity to pathogens, emerging evidence support their pathogenic role in chronic inflammatory, metabolic and autoimmune pathologies [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] .",

These CD4 -CD8cells expressed comparable levels of CD161 and displayed a phenotype very similar to the CD4 -CD8 + CD161 high cells within cluster 8 (Supplementary Fig. 7a,d and i-m) Monocytes and DCs represent major producers of IL-1\u03b2 and autocrine signaling by IL-1\u03b2 is known to induce its own production in human monocytes 85 . All three conventional human monocyte subsets namely, CM, IMM and NCM produce IL-1\u03b2. However, NCM produced lower levels of IL-1\u03b2, both under basal conditions and after LPS stimulation as compared to the CM and IMM 86 . It is unclear if all monocyte subsets respond to IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. Our CyTOF analysis identified 8 monocyte subsets and CD11c mDCs and CD123 pDCs. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that IL-1\u03b2 induces expression of p-NF-kB and p-p38 only in the CM subsets. Human monocyte subsets display remarkable heterogeneity in their surface marker expression, effector functions and differentiation potential 87 . CM exhibit a more proinflammatory phenotype as compared the NCM and IMM subsets.",

Within the two DCs subsets, IL-1\u03b2-induced p-NF-kB expression was seen only in the CD11c mDCs. Notably, unlike T cells and NK cells, IL-1\u03b2-induced expression of p-NF-kB, but not of p-p38 in the CM and CD11c mDCs remained elevated for prolonged time periods. This data suggests involvement of the NF-kB pathway in the autocrine IL-1\u03b2 signaling that may lead to continued production of IL-1\u03b2 under chronic inflammatory conditions. Within the NK subsets, IL-1\u03b2 induced expression of p-NF-kB in the CD16 -CD56 dim CD161 + (cluster 2) and CD16 -CD56 bright CD161cells (cluster 3). CD161 is a C-type lectin receptor and CD161 expression divides circulating NK cells in healthy adults into two distinct populations, with ~80% cells being CD161 + 88 . Both CD56 bright and CD56 dim subsets comprise CD161 + cells. Notably, CD161 + NK cells within the CD56 dim subset produced more IFN-\u03b3 than their CD161counterpart, were more proliferative and showed an increased responsiveness to IL-12 and IL-18 88 . Furthermore, a higher frequency of the CD161 + NK cells were present in the inflamed intestinal lamina propria of patients with inflammatory bowel disease 88 . Here, using the high-dimensional approach, we have identified a subset of CD161 + NK cells with dim expression of CD56 that responds to IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. It would be interesting to investigate if our cluster 2 shares phenotypic and functional properties with that of the CD161 + NK cells identified by Kurioka et al 88 or constitute a separate subset that responds specifically to IL-1\u03b2.",

Moreover, the majority (~80%) of the cells in cluster 17 were CD56 -. Interestingly, cluster 17 showed a robust induction of p-NF-kB, p-p38 as well as activation of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 at later time points. Human innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) also express CD161 89 and Ohne et al. 22 demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2 plays a critical role in inducing proliferation, cytokine production, maturation and plasticity of human ILC2. IL-1\u03b2 mediated these effects in combination with IL-2 and/or IL-12, and NF-kB inhibition blocked IL-1\u03b2-induced responses 22 . Notably, p-NF-kB + cells within our cluster 17 bear resemblance to the phenotype of the ILC2. Consistent with the higher expression of CD127 in the ILC2 cells as compared to the CD56 bright NK cells as shown by Ohne et al., 22 the p-NF-kB + cells within cluster 17 expressed higher CD127 than the p-NF-kB + cells within the CD56 bright NK cells (cluster 3) (Supplementary Fig. 10d) . However, in contrast to the ILC2, around 20-30% of the p-NF-kB + cells within cluster 17 were found to be CD56 dim (Supplementary Figs. 10e,f) .",

Indeed, induction of p-STAT1, p-STAT3 and p-STAT5 expression across multiple immune cell subtypes after prolonged IL-1\u03b2 stimulation indicates signaling mediated by secondary mediators such as IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17A. Robust induction of p-NF-kB expression in the CCR6 + EM T cells, CD11c mDC and the Lin -CD161 + CD25 + cells indicate that these cell types may play an important upstream role in IL-1\u03b2-mediated inflammation including cytokine storm. This novel comprehensive atlas of IL-1\u03b2-induced signaling in circulating human immune cells provides new insights into the cell types most vulnerable to IL-1\u03b2 activation and the timing of these effects in humans. Together, these provide key data for the study and design of more targeted approaches to chronic inflammatory diseases that may lessen adverse effects. Moreover, our work has clear implications for the development of immune phenotypic approaches to identify COVID-19 subjects at higher risk of cytokine storm and those most likely to benefit from therapies targeting IL-1\u03b2 or its ",

Different cell types including, conventional Th17 cells as well as the unconventional subsets, \u03b3\u03b4, NKT and MAIT cells 50,63-65 express CD161, and confer pathogenic roles in inflammatory diseases53,66,67 . Further work is warranted to establish the identity of the CD4 -CD8 -CD161 high and CD4 -CD8 + CD161 high cells (cluster 8) that showed IL-1\u03b2-induced expression of p-NF-kB and p-p38, and investigate how IL-1\u03b2 modulates their effector functions.Another novel finding of the present study is the identification of CCR6 as a marker to identify T cells most responsive to IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. Our analysis demonstrated that the IL-1\u03b2 responsive CCR6 + cells belong to the EM phenotype and a majority of these CCR6 + EM T cells co-express CCR2 and CD26. Notably, circulating human CD4 and CD8 T cells capable of producing IL-17 are enriched in the CCR6 + memory T cells68 , and CD4 helper T cells that produce type 17 cytokines express the highest levels of the catalytically active dipeptidylpeptidase IV (CD26) ectoenzyme 29 . Interestingly, while Tregs are largely anti-inflammatory, a proportion of the circulating MTregs in healthy humans express high levels of RORC and secrete IL-1769 . IL-1\u03b2 together with IL-23 plays a critical role in human TH17 cell development and regulation of TH17 cytokines[70][71][72][73] . It is possible that the cells within the CCR6 + EM T cell population that respond to IL-1\u03b2 bear a TH17-like characteristic. Abundant evidence implicateTH17 cells and sustained production of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of diverse inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 74-80 . Increased frequency of TH17 cells and higher levels of TH17 cytokines have been reported in patients with inflammatory diseases and blocking the IL-17 pathway has shown potential benefit in some inflammatory diseases 74,76,78,81,82 . IL-17 confers pathogenic effects through enhanced production of cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, GM-CSF), chemokines (IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL20, MCP-1), metalloproteinases and other inflammatory molecules 83 . These proinflammatory mediators promote inflammation, immune cell infiltration and tissue damage. Additionally, IL-17-induced IL-6 maintains the TH17-T cell population 83 . The IL-1\u03b2-responsive EM T cells expressing CCR6, CCR2 and possibly other chemokine receptors may be recruited to sites of inflammation where IL-1\u03b2 together with other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-23 or antigen-mediated TCR activation may activate them to produce proinflammatory cytokines and cause tissue damage. Taken together, findings raise the interesting possibility that CCR6 + EM T cells and/or IL-17 producing cells likely plays an important role in mediating IL-1\u03b2-induced inflammatory response in humans. One probable antiinflammtory mechanism of IL-1 blockers may thus be via reduction of the proinflammatory TH17 response. Indeed, in RA patients, Anakinra therapy associated with clinical improvement decreased the frequency of TH17 cells and serum levels of IL-17 and IL-21 84 .",
