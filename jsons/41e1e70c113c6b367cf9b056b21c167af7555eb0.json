            "text": "Six HCoVs have been identified to date: HCoV-229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV). HCoV-229E and NL63 belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus, while the other four HCoVs belong to the genus Betacoronavirus, with HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 in lineage A, SARS-CoV in lineage B and MERS-CoV in lineage C . SARS-CoV is the causative agent of SARS, which emerged as a previously unknown severe human respiratory infection in the Guangdong Province of China in 2002 (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003) . SARS is highly contagious, and by the end of the 2003 epidemic a total of 8098 probable SARS cases had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 29 countries, with 774 SARSrelated deaths (case fatality rate: 9.6 %) (WHO, 2004) . Before the discovery of SARS-CoV in 2003, only two HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E and OC43, were known (Lu et al., 2012) ; however, these did not attract much attention as they only caused mild upper respiratory tract infections in humans (Wevers & van der Hoek, 2009 ). With surging interest in CoVs after the emergence of SARS, two additional novel HCoVs, NL63 and HKU1, were identified in , respectively (van der Hoek et al., 2004 Woo et al., 2005) , which also caused only mild upper respiratory tract infections (Wevers and van der Hoek, 2009 ). However, in 2012, MERS attracted more attention as an emerging infectious disease because it caused severe lower respiratory infection and renal failure, similar to the clinical manifestation of SARS. The responsible agent was identified as a novel HCoV named MERS-CoV .",

Thus, it is suspected that the emerging MERS-CoV might also originate from bats. Recent studies have revealed diverse types of MERSrelated CoVs in bats from Saudi Arabia (Memish et al., 2013a) , Africa (Ithete et al., 2013) , Europe (Annan et al., 2013) and Asia (Yang et al., 2014) . Studies on the receptor usage of MERS-CoV have also revealed a bat origin of MERS-CoV. An initial study found that the receptor used by MERS-CoV was different from the one used by SARS-CoV. The receptor may be conserved, since MERS-CoV can replicate in both bat and human cells (M\u00fcller et al., 2012) . Later, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) was identified as the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV . Bat CoV-HKU4, which is closely related to MERS-CoV, can also use DPP4 as a receptor to initiate cellular entry, and this discovery further supports the hypothesis that bats might be the natural reservoirs of MERS-CoV (Wang et al., 2014) .",

Consistent with serological evidence, recent studies also found that MERS-CoV carried by camels was genetically highly similar to that detected in humans. An investigation of an outbreak on a farm in Qatar found that sequences of MERS-CoV in the nasal swabs from three of 14 seropositive camels were similar to those of two human cases on the same farm . Near-full-genome sequences of MERS-CoV were also identified from nasal swabs from camels in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt, and these isolates were genetically highly similar to those isolated from humans Hemida et al., 2014; Nowotny & Kolodziejek, 2014) . A full-genome sequence of MERS-CoV was obtained from a camel in Qatar, which was genetically highly similar to the human isolates, and the camel-derived MERS-CoV could efficiently replicate in human cells, providing further evidence for the zoonotic potential of MERS-CoV from camels .",

In addition, both human and camel MERS-CoV isolates were weak inducers of innate immune responses in a human cell line, further suggesting phenotypic similarities between camel and human MERS-CoV isolates. The similarity of tropism and replication competence of MERS-CoV isolates from human and camels in ex vivo cultures of human respiratory tract tissues suggested that exposure to zoonotic MERS-CoV could lead to human infection (Chan et al., 2014) .",

In addition, several investigations of MERS-CoV seroprevalence in people in contact with camels yielded negative results (Aburizaiza et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2015; Memish et al., 2015) . The controversy faded with a population-based seroepidemiological survey of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, which provided evidence of the role of camels in the zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV to humans. The survey showed that seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly higher in individuals exposed to camels than in the general population, and it estimated that a large number of young men who had contact with camels were infected with MERS-CoV but did not show apparent symptoms, and that they might be responsible for the human MERS cases without previous camel exposure experience (M\u00fcller et al., 2015) . A recent study also suggested that exposure to camels was a risk factor for infection, as MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies were detected only in healthy persons who had daily occupational contact with camels, but not in persons without such contact .",

Other possible routes for camel-to-human transmission include food-borne transmission through consumption of unpasteurized camel milk/raw meat and the medicinal use of camel urine. Camels are an important source of milk in some Middle East countries and parts of Africa, and more than half of the camel milk is sold as unpasteurized fresh or fermented milk to local and urban consumers in Saudi Arabia (Faye et al., 2014) . A survey found the presence of MERS-CoV RNA in the milk of camels actively shedding the virus (Reusken et al., 2014a) . Whether MERS-CoV in milk is secreted by infected camels or is introduced as a contaminant during the milking process needs further investigation. An experimental study of the stability of MERS-CoV in milk showed that viable viruses could still be recovered after 48 h regardless of reduction in virus titre, indicating that infection could happen by consumption of unpasteurized fresh raw milk . Consumption of undercooked meat from infected camels and handling of infected raw camel meat without proper protective equipment may also pose risks for getting MERS-CoV from camels. Camel urine is part of the traditional pharmacopoeia (Al-Yousef et al., 2012) , and is used as a natural remedy for a variety of ailments in Middle Eastern countries. These practices may represent risk factors for infection, and further studies are needed to prove their camel-to-human transmission potential.",

To date, WHO has declared that the overall transmission patterns of MERS remain unchanged, i.e. multiple introductions from animals to humans and secondary transmission in healthcare settings (WHO, 2015) . Therefore, identification of the zoonotic sources of MERS-CoV might guide control strategies at the human-animal interface to stop future human infection. If the spillover process of MERS-CoV from animals to humans could be stopped, we may be able to put an end to further nosocomial outbreaks in the Middle East and beyond.",

In agreement with the serological findings, the detection rate of MERS-CoV RNA in the nasal and/or rectal swabs of juvenile camels was higher than in those of adult camels (Alagaili et al., 2014) . In addition, a recent study found that MERS-CoV mainly targeted camels of less than 4 years of age, particularly calves, and the infection in juvenile camels manifested as an acute, epidemic and time-limited infection. Thus, delaying the social separation of calves or avoiding contact with camels aged less than 4 years might be a simple but effective measure to reduce spillover of MERS-CoV from camels to humans (Wernery et al., 2015) .",

The recent MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea, the largest MERS outbreak ever recorded outside of Saudi Arabia, was a result of nosocomial transmission: a single exported case with a travel history in the Middle East resulted in 185 laboratory-confirmed human infections in Korea and one in China, with 36 deaths (WHO, 2015) . The outbreak pattern in Korea was similar to the hospital outbreaks that occurred in the Middle East, which were attributed to failures of infection prevention and control in healthcare settings (Lee & Wong, 2015; Oboho et al., 2015) . Therefore, early diagnosis, prompt isolation of suspected cases and timely contact tracing of case contacts are key strategies to prevent nosocomial transmission.",

Moreover, modes of camelto-human transmission have not been fully elucidated. Our current understanding of camel-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is that MERS-CoV entered the human population in the Arabian Peninsula on multiple occasions from direct or indirect contact with infected camels or camel-related products (e.g. raw camel milk, camel urine). Further efforts are required to prove the effectiveness of these modes of camel-to-human transmission.",
