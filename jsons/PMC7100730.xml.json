Therefore, it is interesting to consider whether the Th2 immune response (eosinophil, IL-5, IL-4, and eotaxin) results from the IVIG treatment or from the disease course of KD. We hypothesized that eosinophils in KD are a witness of the Th2 immune response due to the eosinophil positivity associated with the Th2 immune response (IL-5) but not with its activation marker (ECP). Moreover, eosinophils also are a witness of disease outcome (CAL formation and IVIG treatment response) in the acute stage and may have some role in the late allergy.",

Levels of both Th1- and Th2-related cytokines are reported to be increased during the acute stage of KD including tumor necrosis factor-alpha [5], IL-6, IL-8 [19], IL-4 [2, 6, 12], IL-5, eotaxin, and IL-10 [6].

[23, 24] reported that the CD40 ligand (CD40L) is expressed on CD4 T-cells and platelets in KD patients. In certain types of vasculitis, CD40L has been implicated, and the CD40L expression on CD4 T-cells and platelets but not on CD8 T-cells is significantly correlated with the occurrence of coronary artery dilation [23, 24].
