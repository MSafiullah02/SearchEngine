We, as physicians, adapt as best we know how, working tirelessly as strong multi- disciplinary groups to ensure that despite these extraordinary times, we continue to put our patients\u2019 needs first.

Hobfoll et al[6] described five empirically supported intervention principles to guide and inform intervention efforts in the presence of early and mid-term mass trauma: a sense of safety; calming; a sense of self and community efficacy; connectedness; and hope. Based on these principles, the primary goal of \u2018Buddy Up\u2019 is to alleviate Covid-19 pandemic-related stress by recognising the importance of being connected and building a community to ground our stress and strengthen resilience. Our system asks oncologists to group together in twos or threes for daily check-ins, monitoring each other for stress that may become distress via phone call, email or text message. Messages may be words, phrases or simply an emoji in response to simple questions such as \u2018How are you feeling?\u2019, \u2018Are you sleeping, eating, exercising?\u2019.",

Since substantial evidence supports the benefits of mindfulness and meditation[7], the third strategy entailed virtual meditation lounges, led by physicians for physicians, allowing for a sense of safety, calm and hope. Finally, recognizing that one size does not fit all and that options are essential, a list of virtual links to activities such as yoga, Pilates, exercise, art galleries and music was created.",
