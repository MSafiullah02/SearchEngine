Although effective, this made them difficult to export because of the regulatory hurdles required for such a production. Indeed, the expansion of virus-specific T cells often requires clean rooms, quality control, quality assurance, release testing and documentation to meet current good manfuacturing practice (cGMP) compliance. One of the first cGMP-compliant strategies reported for the manufacture of virus-specific T cells was the selection of virus-specific T cells from bulk donors' T lymphocytes by tetramer selection (9). The advantages of this method were the rapid availability of the T cells and the ease of the selection process, which does not require antigen-presenting cells (APCs), exogenous cytokines or extended ex vivo manipulation and can be performed with the use of closed-system devices outside of a dedicated clean room or GMP facility. However, tetramer-mediated selection only selects T cells specific for a single HLA-restricted epitope of a single virus (in this case CMV) and is generally only available for donors with the most common of HLA types. Although sometimes effective, focusing the antiviral response to one epitope leaves the patient vulnerable to antigenic escape, as has been observed clinically for EBV 20, 21.",

This approach was investigated in the 1990s to generate EBV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) by stimulating PBMC with EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) (23) and was later modified to include a first stimulation with dendritic cells transduced with clinical-grade adenoviral vectors expressing viral antigens for EBV or CMV, thus expanding the antiviral specificity of the CTL (11). Furthermore, CTL expanded in this way enable T cells to recognize three viruses (EBV [from the LCL], CMV [from the engineered adenoviral vector], and adenovirus [from the adenoviral vector]) in a single culture with a very high specificity starting from a relatively low blood volume (50\u201360 mL). The limitation of this approach is that it is time-consuming (up to 3 months), requires the use of a clinical grade viral vector, which is expensive, and can be a major regulatory hurdle.",

To address this unmet need, several groups have evaluated strategies to stimulate the naive T cells present in cord blood 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.

Peggs et al. from the University College of London generated CMV-specific T cells by selecting IFN-\u03b3\u2013secreting T cells after exposure to viral antigens. They treated 18 matched related donor (MRD) and matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT recipients both as prophylaxis and as pre-emptive therapy. The results of this trial were promising for patients treated as prophylaxis (six of seven patients did not have CMV re-activation after CMV-specific T-cell infusion), but this approach appeared to be less efficient in clearing ongoing infections, because nine of 11 patients treated pre-emptively still required additional antiviral drugs. Moreover, in this trial, GvHD was observed in multiple patients, probably as a consequence of selecting highly activated T cells (10) (Table II\n).",

In a multi-institutional study enrolling 114 patients undergoing MRD, MUD and haplo-HSCT, none of the 101 patients who received donor-derived EBV-specific CTLs both as prophylaxis and as pre-emptive therapy had development of PTLD, and no cases of de novo GvHD occurred after CTL infusion (41). Historically, in patients who received T-cell\u2013depleted grafts with similar conditioning regimens, the rate of PLTD was approximately 11%. Furthermore, of the 13 patients who were treated for overt PTLD, 11 achieved complete remission that was sustained without recurrence. The most significant adverse effects seen were localized but reversible and included swelling at sites of disease during the therapeutic response in four patients with bulky disease at the time of T-cell therapy. In addition, the group at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center reported the results of another large study that used EBV-specific CTLs for the treatment of PTLD: 47 patients with HSCT were treated for PTLD with donor-derived or third-party\u2013derived EBV CTLs, with an overall response rate of 68% without evidence of de novo or recurrent GvHD (42). Other smaller studies reported similar results in terms of both efficacy and safety of EBV-specific CTLs obtained by LCL stimulation 43, 44. Hence, the adoptive transfer of EBV-specific T cells is a safe and effective strategy both in the prophylaxis or therapeutic setting (45).",

One large study from Australia demonstrated the efficacy and the safety of infusing bi-virus\u2013specific T cells to 50 MRD and MUD HSCT recipients. These patients received T cells specific for CMV (with or without adenovirus) as prophylaxis and observed the same incidence of GvHD and a statistically significant reduced incidence of CMV re-activation compared with a cohort of patients who received the same HSCT protocol but did not receive CMV-specific T cells (49). To further broaden the specificity of CTL, the group at Baylor College of Medicine expanded T cells targeting CMV, EBV and adenovirus in a single culture. Among the 33 MRD, MUD and haploidentical (haplo) HSCT patients who received CMV, EBV and AdV-specific T cells, they described eight cases of CMV re-activation, 11 cases of Adv infection and 10 cases of EBV reactivation/PTLD. All viral infections resolved after CTL therapy. EBV-and CMV-specific T cells were detected in the peripheral blood after infusion in almost all patients treated. However, AdV-specific T cells were found only in patients who had AdV infection. Importantly, however, no cases of GvHD were observed despite the fact that the majority of the patients were recipients of alternate donor grafts 11, 41.",

To extend this approach to others viruses, the group at Baylor College of Medicine described a method by which it is possible to rapidly generate a single preparation of polyclonal (CD4+ and CD8+) T cells that are specific for seven viruses (EBV, CMV, Adv, BK, HHV6, human respiratory syncytial virus and influenza) frequently described as important risk factors affecting prognosis after HSCT (13).

The generation and the banking of HLA-typed virus-specific T-cell lines ready to be infused could represent an option for patients suitable for antiviral T-cell\u2013based immunotherapy but for whom the clinical condition requires a prompt intervention (Table V\n). This \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d approach was initially evaluated by Haque et al.\n(55), who treated 33 patients (HSCT recipients and solid organ transplantation recipients) with third-party EBV-specific CTL for PTLD. They observed overall response rates of 64% at 5 weeks and 52% at 6 months, with no cases of GvHD or graft rejection. The best results were observed in patients who received donor T cells that were best HLA-matched with the recipient (55). The Memorial Sloan Kettering Group also confirmed the safety of this strategy describing their results comparing the use of third-party EBV-specific CTLs with the use of donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI) in patients who had development of PTLD after CB HSCT. Whereas the response rate was similar in both groups, GvHD occurred more frequently in patients treated with DLI (56). In 2011, Quasim et al.\n(57) also described the results of a trial enrolling patients with development of AdV infection after MUD HSCT treated with third-party AdV-specific T cells, highlighting a high risk of GvHD development, but, in this case, T cells were generated by means of the IFN-\u03b3 capture technology, which may increase the risk for the presence of alloreactive T cells in the infused product.",

This study showed that a clinical effect is possible even when the CTL donor and transplant recipient only share one single HLA locus. The caveat is that the shared allele must be known to present a known and effective epitope of the virus, meaning that extensive in vitro characterization of the CTL lines must be performed by laboratories with extensive expertise (58). Nevertheless, this approach resulted in a 74% complete or partial response rate. Importantly, 50 patients with an array of HLA types were successfully treated with the use of only 18 cell lines. Furthermore, this approach demonstrated that an in-depth characterization of the CTL product not only serves as a measure of potency but can also be used to customize a treatment for each patient through the use of the banked T cells.",

Since the first clinical trial testing the efficacy of these cells, advances have been trending toward making the technology faster, more streamlined, standardized and more affordable. To move beyond phase I/II, later phase clinical trials are typically sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies interested in marketing their product, and this type of partnership is essential for cell therapy to continue to move beyond early-phase clinical trials. From an academic perspective, laboratories must continue to innnovate and make laborious procceses more efficient, cost effective and more broadly applicable. Beyond processing, alternative transduction methods such as transposons and overlapping peptides must be optimized to limit the use of viral vectors (59).",

One of most investigated and promising approaches to overcome some of the limitations of antiviral drugs is adoptive immunotherapy with the use of virus-specific T cells. At the moment, different virus-specific T-cell isolation/generation techniques are available: each has its own advantages and limitations, and none of them has been shown to be superior in pre-clinical studies. To move virus-specific T-cell therapy to the mainstream, larger studies are necessary to simplify the manufacturing process and to extend the availability to all HSCT recipients, irrespective of their donor status. Rapid T-cell generation and third-party\u2013derived T-cell infusion are being currently investigated as potential solution to overcome some of the limitations regarding availability, but, in the meantime, other solutions (ie, CTL generation from virus-naive sources) should also continue to be tested to further broaden the application of this approach.",

(B) To prepare virus-specific T cells with the use of multimers, T cells are incubated with multimers that mimic the peptide:MHC binding of an APC. The T cells that bind the multimer are then isolated with the use of magnetic beads or fluorescence-activated cell sorting. (C) In the gamma-capture technique, T cells are activated use of the peptide of interest to stimulate the T cells. Once the T cells are stimulated, antibodies bind IFN-\u03b3 and the T cell, allowing the T cells to be isolated by magnetic selection. (D) To improve on the classic ex vivo expansion system, the rapid system utilizes the APCs present in the PBMC. The PBMCs are pulsed with overlapping peptides representing the viral antigens(s) of interest. APCs pulsed with the peptides then stimulate the T cells to grow.
