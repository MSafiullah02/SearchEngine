            "text": "Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) is responsible for acute, sometimes fatal, gastroenteritis in dogs (Carmichael and Binn, 1981). CPV-2 emerged in the late 1970s (Kelly, 1978, Appel et al., 1979, Burtonboy et al., 1979, Johnson and Spreadbrow, 1979), but it was replaced in a few years by its antigenic variants (Parrish et al., 1985, Parrish et al., 1988, Parrish et al., 1991). Currently, three main antigenic variants of CPV-2 are known, named type 2a, 2b and 2c and variously distributed in dog population worldwide (Mochizuki et al., 1993, De Ybanez et al., 1995, Greenwood et al., 1996, Truyen et al., 1996, Truyen et al., 2000, Steinel et al., 1998, Sagazio et al., 1998, Buonavoglia et al., 2000, Pereira et al., 2000, Buonavoglia et al., 2001, Martella et al., 2004, Desario et al., 2005, Decaro et al., 2005b, Decaro et al., 2005c, Decaro et al., 2006). CPV-2c, designated previously as CPV Glu-426 mutant, emerged in Italy in 2000 (Buonavoglia et al., 2001) and has been detected in other countries (Nakamura et al., 2004). Moreover, its pathogenicity has been investigated (Decaro et al., 2005a). The original type 2, although disappeared from the field, is still present in the CPV-2 vaccines available on the market (Parrish et al., 1988).",

            "text": "Traditionally, identification of the CPV-2 variants is carried out by means of time-consuming techniques, such as haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (Parrish and Carmichael, 1983, Nakamura et al., 2004), PCR-RFLP with enzyme MboII (Buonavoglia et al., 2001), PCR-based methods (Pereira et al., 2000), or sequence analysis, often requiring the use of combined methods for the definitive prediction of antigen specificity. Recently, two real-time PCR assays using minor groove binder (MGB) probes have been developed for rapid and unambiguous characterisation of CPV-2 (Decaro et al., 2005b, Decaro et al., 2006). The MGB probe assays are able to recognise the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) existing between types 2a/2b (A4062G) and between types 2b/2c (T4064A), which determine the presence at residue 426 of the capsid protein of amino acids Asn, Asp and Glu in types 2a, 2b and 2c, respectively (Parrish et al., 1991, Buonavoglia et al., 2001 and Table 1\n). Both type 2a/2b and type 2b/2c assays were found highly sensitive and specific, although the type 2a-specific probe was not able to discriminate type 2a CPVs from the original type 2. In fact, both types present nucleotide A at position 4062 of the viral genome, so that the old type is characterised erroneously as type 2a using the MGB strategy (Decaro et al., 2005b, Decaro et al., 2006). This makes the type 2a/2b MGB probe assay inadequate for discrimination between dogs vaccinated with the original type 2 and dogs infected with type 2a, although it has been noted that the vaccine virus is shed in the faeces at low titres and for a shorter time period than field strains and that usually the diagnostic tests are carried out on the faeces of sick animals (Decaro et al., 2006). Some problems may occur especially when testing faecal samples collected from dogs displaying diarrhoea few days after administration of a type 2-based vaccine, when it is crucial to be able to detect differentially the vaccine virus and the field strains of CPV-2.",

In fact, the modified-live virus contained in the vaccines is able to replicate in the intestinal mucosa of vaccinated dogs (Carmichael et al., 1984, Buonavoglia et al., 1983), despite the unnatural route of administration (intramuscular or subcutaneous instead of oronasal), and to be shed in the faeces albeit at low titres and for a shorter time period with respect to field strains, as noted in a previous work (Decaro et al., 2006). In such a circumstance, the detection of CPV-2 or its nucleic acid in the faeces of vaccinated dogs could provide false-positive results, leading to a misdiagnosis of the disease probably caused by other enteric pathogens of dogs, i.e., canine coronavirus, canine distemper virus, reoviruses, rotaviruses, Salmonella spp., etc. Moreover, it would be important to rule out vaccine-induced disease due to regaining of virulence of the vaccine (old type) virus. For this purpose, the characterisation of CPV using traditional techniques is often inconclusive, since a simultaneous infection by the type 2-based vaccine and wild-type virus may mislead the results of HI with MAbs, PCR-RFLP and sequence analysis.",

Two primers specific for the wild types (types 2a and 2b) were selected to have one such mutation at the very 3\u2032 end, as nucleotide mismatches that occur at the 3\u2032 end of a primer are highly detrimental to primer extension and strongly decrease PCR amplification. However, in our experience, such mutations were not sufficient to prevent completely amplification of the old type virus (vaccine) (V. Martella, N. Decaro and C. Buonavoglia, personal observation). Moreover, samples containing both vaccine and wild-type strains are amplified successfully, so that the PCR-based strategy will not be able to detect the simultaneous presence of the two viruses in the faeces.",

In fact, vaccine virus shed in the faeces would be recognised by the probe specific for the CPV variants, being characterised as a field strain instead of a vaccine strain. Consequently, an additional assay should be developed which is able to discriminate the type 2b vaccines from type 2b field CPVs, in order to obtain a correct discrimination between dogs vaccinated and infected with CPV-2b. In conclusion, the test we have developed does not allow the discrimination of all vaccine viruses from field strains, but it could help a correct diagnosis when dogs display enteritis shortly after the administration of type 2-based vaccines, that are mostly used worldwide.",
