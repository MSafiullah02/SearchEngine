Their intended use may mimic their original anatomical function, such as using a patellar ligament for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction or a cortical bone segment to repair a long-bone fracture. In other circumstances, their use may differ from original anatomy, such as using a dermal layer for rotator cuff repair or a ground amniotic membrane combined with demineralized cortical bone for a spine fusion procedure. This chapter focuses on the intent and science of various means of processing human allograft tissues to ensure safety and clinical use.",

This classification applies to most human tissue transplants. It differs from a medical device classification, in which, to qualify as an HCT/P, the tissue needs to meet standards of not exceeding \u201cminimal manipulation\u201d such that the \u201coriginal relevant characteristics\u201d are not altered, and also \u201chomologous use\u201d meaning the tissue is used clinically in a similar manner to that intended in the body of origin.20, 21 A clear example of a tissue meeting these requirements would be a hamstring tendon that is recovered intact, disinfected, sterilized, and then used for tendon replacement. Conversely, although bone void filler putty containing DBM would be considered for homologous use, it may be considered more than minimally manipulated because of the addition of a synthetic carrier and thus be classified as a medical device requiring FDA clearance before distribution. In further example, a disinfected and freeze-dried cortical bone segment used as an intervertebral body spacer is considered both minimally manipulated and intended for homologous use. As processors continue to become more innovative in the use and treatment of human tissues, these definitions will undoubtedly be tested and clarified.",

In this case of terminal sterilization the chosen method must effectively penetrate the packaging; such options will be discussed in subsequent sections.",

This designation indicates the degree, or level, of assurance of sterility achieved through a validated sterilization process. The two most common SALs for allografts are 10\u20133 and 10\u20136. A product labeled with an SAL of 10\u20133 indicates that there is a 1 in 1,000 chance of a single viable microbe present in the tissue, whereas an SAL of 10\u20136 indicates a greater degree of sterility with a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of the same. An SAL of 10\u20136 is the required level of sterilization by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention for medical instruments that breach the skin37 and is thus often referred to as a medical device level of sterility. This level of sterility can only be achieved through terminal sterilization, though some terminally sterilized tissue products still retain an SAL of only 10\u20133.38\n",

Furthermore, several processing methods have been demonstrated to result in significant viral inactivation. For example, low-dose gamma irradiation was demonstrated to inactivate a broad spectrum of viruses, including HIV and enveloped, nonenveloped, DNA, and RNA viruses.39 Another processing method uses vacuum and oscillating pressure combined with chemical agents to inactivate pathogens.40 The use of a terminal sterilization process with the ability to inactivate a wide range of virus types is particularly advantageous as new viruses (e.g., Zika, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and so forth) emerge for which validated blood tests may not yet exist.",

In order, new bone must have a scaffold to grow, referred to as an osteoconductive matrix. Then cytokine signals are required to induce precursor cells to either differentiate toward the osteoblastic lineage or for cells to further express the osteoblastic phenotype of bone formation; these factors are thus considered osteoinductive. Finally, new bone growth requires the presence of bone-forming cells such as osteoblasts or precursors to produce an extracellular, mineralizing matrix, and this cellular component is referred to as osteogenic. Different bone-grafting options may provide one, two, or all three of these properties. For example, a processed cancellous cube is still considered an osteoconductive scaffold capable of supporting new bone growth by interacting with host bone and signals despite potentially having neither significant osteoinductive capacity, being low in native growth factors, nor any osteogenic potential, being devitalized. In another example, a recombinant form of one commercially available specific human growth factor, BMP-2, would be considered as an osteoinductive signal68 but would require the additional presence of osteogenic and osteoconductive components to drive bone formation. Furthermore, an autograft bone and marrow mixture derived from the patient may theoretically provide all three components necessary for new bone formation, but the quantity and quality of grafting material may depend on the surgical site, health, and age of the patient. As an alternative, viable cellular allografts can theoretically provide all three components, and these will be described further in the following sections.",

The most prevalent processing method involves taking advantage of the pervasiveness of native BMPs found in cortical bone. Through careful demineralization, these factors can become bioavailable in the resultant DBM. Typically, a dilute hydrochloric acid solution is used to dissolve some of the bone\u2019s mineral phase (apatitic calcium phosphate), thus exposing these growth factors. In fact, this process mimics the natural action of osteoclasts in bone remodeling as they create a localized acidic environment which similarly dissolves the mineral phase, releasing BMPs to signal cells to lay down new bone.69, 70, 71, 72 If undertreated, hypodemineralization would result in osteoinductive factors still being trapped in the bone matrix and unavailable for rapid signaling, whereas hyperdemineralization may lead to those factors either being eluted out of the matrix during demineralization or overly acid-exposed and denatured, thus yielding a nonosteoinductive material.",

Thus given the presence of bioavailable growth factors within a human bony matrix, properly demineralized DBMs are considered both osteoinductive and osteoconductive, still relying on the patient\u2019s own cells for the osteogenic component. To improve handling, many DBM formulations also use a carrier such as glycerol, hyaluronic acid, starch, and so forth.

The osteoconductive component is bone in the form of chips, fibers, or particulates. The osteogenic component is comprised of cells either adhering to the bone component or added from another source, for example, adipose-derived cells or amniotic tissue. The osteoinductive component may be DBM derived from the same donor or may rely on endogenous trophic factors inherent to the cellular component. Most current cellular bone void filler approaches rely on inclusion of mesenchymal stem cells, assuming that they will produce factors conducive to the healing process and that they will differentiate down the osteoblastic lineage to initiate bone formation. The impact of the patient\u2019s local environment on the differentiation pathway and timing is not well understood. This question becomes increasingly complex when the cell component derives from a nonbone source such as placenta or adipose tissue. Alternatively, cellular bone void fillers can include living cells that are integral to the donor bone and thus, being \u201cbone cells,\u201d are already committed to the osteoblastic lineage.

This process starts with the migration of inflammatory host cells, followed by matrix remodeling, and then finally revascularization, leading to recellularization.96 Although the exact mechanism of host integration is not fully understood, differences in incorporation rates likely begin at the initiation of the process. The initial inflammatory host response is mediated by macrophages and monocytes, which must achieve a careful balance between wound healing and tissue destruction.97 Macrophages regulate the expression of interleukin-1b,98 a cytokine which contributes to the wound-healing process by controlling fibroblast activation.97 The M1 macrophage phenotype is more associated with an inflammatory response, whereas the M2 macrophage phenotype is associated with tissue repair and constructive tissue remodeling.99, 100 Agrawal et al.95 investigated the mechanism of incorporation by examining the effect of macrophage phenotype expression on matrix remodeling using three different human ADMs and one synthetic/bovine ADM. The ADM products displayed differing patterns and timing of macrophage infiltration, leading the authors to conclude that this variability was due to the distinct decellularization processes used for each of the ADM products.

The most commonly used fresh tissues in orthopedic surgery are osteochondral allografts used for cartilage restoration in the knee, shoulder, and talus.101, 102, 103, 104 The advantage of this preservation type is that it can maintain viable cells. In the case of osteochondral grafts, this includes viable chondrocytes that may help restore the recipient\u2019s articular surfaces. These living cells are immunoprivileged and do not require immunosuppressants, making this graft type advantageous because the donor cells can contribute to generating collagenous extracellular matrix.105 To maintain viable cells, the tissue processor will aseptically recover the tissue, take cultures, debride and disinfect, size, and treat with antibiotics. The tissue processor will avoid using methods which remove cellular material either deliberately, as those used in decellularization processes previously discussed, or incidentally, as a result of some type of chemical or physical cleaning processes.105 Once processed, the allograft is packaged and stored at 1\u201310\u00b0C in quarantine until the bacterial, fungal, and viral tests results are obtained. Storage time is a critical factor for these grafts as studies have shown that cell viability decreases with time.104 Storage media can also impact cell viability, and this is an area of ongoing research and development.106, 107, 108, 109\n",

Therefore, this type of preservation is used for allografts in which maintenance of viability is not an objective, such as in structural bone allografts, tendons, and acellular dermis. For frozen grafts not processed with cryopreservants, the process generally includes pathogen testing, debridement, cleaning, and disinfecting to remove remnant cells, marrow, lipids, and bioburden before being frozen and stored. For tissues that do contain living cells, for example, cellular bone void fillers or osteochondral grafts, cryopreservation solutions are used.

However, the tissues must remain frozen until use and therefore require special shipping conditions, as well as on-site storage in a validated freezer that is monitored 24/7 for temperature.113 Frozen tissue may also require a lengthy thawing time depending on the tissue type, and once the allograft has been thawed, the allograft must be used or discarded.

After the tissue has been cleaned and processed, freeze-drying is achieved by using specialized equipment to reduce the residual moisture to a level that maintains tissue quality, which may vary depending on the tissue type. The lyophilization process must be validated and monitored, and the storage conditions must maintain the appropriate moisture level.114 An advantage of freeze-drying is that the allograft can typically be stored for years at ambient temperature and then rehydrated when needed. With ambient temperature storage, there is no need for a special freezer or specialized shipping conditions. However, the rehydration time can be lengthy, and some grafts may never fully rehydrate. Even full hydration may not be able to restore the tissue\u2019s native properties and may leave tissues in a fragile state, making them susceptible to damage during implantation. For example, some studies have found that freeze-dried bone may exhibit brittleness and weakness compared with frozen or glycerol-preserved bone, which could be especially problematic for a weight-bearing graft.115, 116, 117 In addition, preclinical and clinical reports118, 119, 120 have raised concerns about immunologic response to freeze-dried bone and tendons. In spite of these potential limitations, freeze-dried allografts, especially ground bone void fillers, are widely used and clinically successful.121, 122, 123, 124\n",

            "text": "To provide the convenience of ambient storage while avoiding potential tissue alterations inherent with freeze-drying, some tissue processors have developed solution-based methods of ambient preservation. Currently, there are two main preservants used for allografts, namely solutions containing ethanol or glycerol, although saline solution is used for some bone grafts. Ethanol storage is a traditional and economical method used to preserve tissues. Ecologists and natural history museums have been using this method to preserve intact specimens for many decades. It is also used in forensic science to preserve DNA samples. Ethanol preserves tissue by driving water out of tissue and cells, essentially dehydrating the tissue.125 The other most common ambient temperature storage method is to treat the tissue with glycerol, which acts as a humectant to protect the tissues, keeping them fully hydrated. Glycerol is a nontoxic, biodegradable liquid that the FDA classifies as \u201cgenerally recognized as safe.\u201d126 It is a common ingredient in over 1500 food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products127 and has been widely used in DBM allografts for spinal applications since 1991. By holding in moisture, glycerol allows allografts to be stored at ambient temperature without drying out. Ethanol storage is most commonly used on ADM allografts, whereas glycerol storage can be effectively used for bone as well as ADMs. In clinical studies comparing glycerol-preserved bone to either freeze-dried or frozen bone, the authors found that glycerol-preserved bone performed as well as freeze-dried and frozen bone while having a shorter preparation time.117, 128\n",
