Neuroinflammation initiated by astroglial cells plays cardinal roles in the CNS, including protective responses against infection and restorative responses to CNS injury. However, the same components that participate in host protective responses are observed in neuroinflammatory disorders (Sochocka, Diniz, & Leszek, 2016). Indeed, pathologic neuroinflammation is reported in many CNS diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and traumatic brain injury (Czirr & Wyss\u2010Coray, 2012; Shastri, Bonifati, & Kishore, 2013). The critical balance between neuroprotection and neurodegeneration is largely dependent on microglia immune responses (Ransohoff & Brown, 2012).",

            "text": "Microglia, the resident macrophages of the CNS (Hanisch & Kettenmann, 2007), play an important role in patrolling the parenchymal tissue, contributing to the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis and the initiation of innate immune responses in the brain (Kettenmann, Hanisch, Noda, & Verkhratsky, 2011; Perry & Teeling, 2013; Ransohoff & Brown, 2012). In line with their myeloid origin, microglia express numerous pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), among which toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) (Eggen, Raj, Hanisch, & Boddeke, 2013; Shastri et al., 2013), involved in the recognition of pathogen\u2010 or damage\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs, respectively). Upregulation and activation of several TLRs in microglia has been described as a protective mechanism during infection by viruses, bacteria and parasites (Sochocka et al., 2016). In the context of neurodegeneration, the initial activation of microglia (and other glial cells) by DAMPs plays a pivotal role in repairing injury and maintaining the CNS homeostasis, but with the increase in neuronal death, this very same activation further potentiates cell death, thus enhancing neurodegeneration (Hanke & Kielian, 2011; Hayward & Lee, 2014; Kigerl, de Rivero Vaccari, Dietrich, Popovich, & Keane, 2014; Shastri et al., 2013; Su, Bai, Zhou, & Zhang, 2016). Consequently, it is conceived that regulating the activation of microglia, for example, through TLRs, may allow the regulation of several neurological diseases (Pedras\u2010Vasconcelos, Puig, & Verthelyi, 2009).",

Most TLRs signal uniquely via MyD88, the exceptions being TLR4, which signals via both MyD88 and TRIF, and TLR3, which signals uniquely through TRIF (Kawai & Akira, 2010). Both MyD88 and TRIF initiate a series of intracellular signaling cascades that culminate with the production of several immune mediators, as cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide (Kawai & Akira, 2010). MyD88\u2010dependent signals efficiently activate the NF\u2010kB family of transcription factors, leading to the production of many cytokines, as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)\u20106, IL\u20101\u03b2, and also IL\u201010 (Pandey et al., 2014). TRIF\u2010mediated signals induce interferon regulatory factor (IRF)\u20103, leading to the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and other IFN\u2010responsive factors (Pandey et al., 2014). Of all these cytokines, two have been associated with protection during neurodegeneration: type I IFNs and IL\u201010.",

            "text": "Type I IFNs comprise a family of cytokines with prominent roles during viral resistance (McNab, Mayer\u2010Barber, Sher, Wack, & O'Garra, 2015). In the context of CNS infections, protective type I IFN responses are also observed, for example, during intracerebral infection with lymphatic choriomeningitis virus (Merigan, Oldstone, & Welsh, 1977; Nayak et al., 2013) or with La Cross virus or coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus, where microglial cells were identified as type I IFN sources (Kallfass et al., 2012; Roth\u2010Cross, Bender, & Weiss, 2008). A role for microglial type I IFN signaling was also described during the resolution of sterile injury (Khorooshi & Owens, 2010). Furthermore, the induction of type I IFNs is critical for limiting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as mice deficient for type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) suffer from a higher disease course, increased macrophage, T\u2010cell and B\u2010cell infiltration, and greater demyelination (Prinz et al., 2008). Importantly, administration of IFN\u2010\u03b2 is the first\u2010line drug for the treatment of MS (Inoue & Shinohara, 2013; Marrie & Rudick, 2006). Despite all these protective effects, chronically increased levels of IFN are linked to various diseases, including encephalitis or other type I interferonopathies (Goldmann, Blank, & Prinz, 2016).",

The production of IL\u201010 by TLR\u2010activated microglia is well documented (Butchi, Du, & Peterson, 2010; Jack et al., 2005; Ledeboer et al., 2002; Mizuno, Sawada, Marunouchi, & Suzumura, 1994; Olson & Miller, 2004). The potential of IL\u201010 in controlling inflammatory responses in the brain has gained recent importance (Kwilasz, Grace, Serbedzija, Maier, & Watkins, 2015). IL\u201010 has been tested as a therapeutic approach to a series of neurologic pathologies, where excessive and persistent neuroinflammation acts as a driver of neurodegeneration. Examples of this include the administration of IL\u201010 in animal models of brain ischemia (Perez\u2010de Puig et al., 2013), Parkinson's disease (Joniec\u2010Maciejak et al., 2014), and MS (Cua, Hutchins, LaFace, Stohlman, & Coffman, 2001). There are, however situations, such as in Alzheimer's disease, where a detrimental role for IL\u201010 has been shown (Chakrabarty et al., 2015; Guillot\u2010Sestier et al., 2015). In either case, modulating IL\u201010 in the CNS appears as an attractive approach to rewire otherwise detrimental immune responses. This calls for a deep understanding on the molecular mechanisms regulating IL\u201010 production in the brain, something that remains poorly studied (Lobo\u2010Silva, Carriche, Castro, Roque, & Saraiva, 2016).",

            "text": "To obtain an overview of the inflammatory landscape of microglia triggered by different TLRs, mouse primary microglia cell cultures were stimulated with chemical agonists for TLR2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR3 (polyI:C), TLR4 (LPS), or TLR9 (CpG). These TLRs are representative of two surface TLRs (TLR2 and 4) mainly associated with the recognition of bacterial products and two intracellular (TLR3 and 9), mainly activated by viruses (Kawai & Akira, 2010). Twenty\u2010four hours poststimulation with the aforementioned TLR agonists, the culture supernatants were assayed for a panel of 13 cytokines by multiplex or ELISA (Figure 1). Of the 13 cytokines tested, IL\u20109 and IL\u201017 were consistently below detection level for all the TLR agonists studied. Also below detection level were all the tested cytokines in nonstimulated cells. We observed that whereas certain cytokines (IL\u201010, IL\u20106, IL\u201012, IFN\u2010\u03b2, IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u20104, and IL\u20105; Figure 1a\u2013g) were greatly dependent on the TLR triggered, others (TNF, IL\u201023, IL\u201027, and IL\u201022; Figure 1h\u2013k) were produced in equivalent amounts, independently of the stimulus. Within the first group, it was interesting to note that TLR3 was the poorest inducer of cytokine production (Figure 1a\u2013g), with the exception of IFN\u2010\u03b2 (Figure 1d), which was induced at higher levels upon TLR3 stimulation of microglia. Furthermore, the production of anti\u2010inflammatory IL\u201010 (Figure 1a) by microglia was among the most affected by the type of TLR stimulated. Indeed, IL\u201010 production varied from the highest amounts induced downstream of TLR9 triggering, to barely detectable ones downstream of TLR3 (Figure 1a). These differential responses were not dependent on the dose of agonist used to stimulate microglia, as increasing the doses of TLR ligands did not result in enhanced secretion of IL\u201010, nor of TNF (Supporting Information, Figure 1). In particular, increasing the doses of TLR3 agonist did not improve IL\u201010 secretion, which was for most of the cases below detection level (data not shown). We then tested whereas non\u2010TLR stimuli would also induce IL\u201010 production by microglia. We found that IL\u201010 production was also triggered by fungal ligands for the PRR dectin\u20101 (Supporting Information, Figure 2a). The combined stimulation dectin\u20101/TLR2 was a more potent stimulus than either independent one (Supporting Information, Figure 2a), being the same pattern was observed for TNF production (Supporting Information, Figure 2b). Finally, we compared the production of IL\u201010 upon TLR stimulation of microglia to that of myeloid cells of the periphery, namely primary mouse bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages. The pattern of IL\u201010 secretion upon TLR stimulation of macrophages for 24 hr (Supporting Information, Figure 3) was similar to that observed for microglia. Interestingly, for both cell types, TLR3 stimulation remained the poorer inducer of IL\u201010 (Supporting Information, Figure 3).",

We next questioned if TLR3 signaling could potentially interfere with other TLRs, in what respects the induction of IL\u201010 in microglia. It was interesting to observe that co\u2010stimulation of TLR2\u2010, TLR4\u2010, or TLR9\u2010activated microglia with TLR3 significantly enhanced IL\u201010 production (Figure 2a\u2013c).

            "text": "To further understand the molecular events underlying the modulation of IL\u201010 upon TLR3 co\u2010stimulation of microglia, we focused on the combination TLR2/TLR3. We measured the transcription of the Il10 gene over time in microglia stimulated via TLR2 alone, TLR3 alone or the combination TLR2/TLR3. Consistent with the decreased amounts of IL\u201010 protein, the transcription of the Il10 gene upon TLR3 stimulation was significantly reduced as compared to that induced by TLR2 activation (Figure 2d). This suggested that the signaling downstream TLR3 is not productive in what concerns IL\u201010 transcription. Co\u2010stimulating microglia with TLR2 and TLR3 did not enhance the amount of Il10 mRNA early poststimulation, when compared with TLR2 stimulation alone (Figure 2d). However, whereas upon TLR2 activation a peak of Il10 gene expression was detected at 1 hr poststimulation and progressively decreased during the analyzed 6 hr, upon TLR2/TLR3 activation, the level of IL\u201010 mRNA peaked at 1 hr and then again at 6 hr poststimulation (Figure 2d). This suggested that in the combined stimulation a second wave of Il10 transcription may be occurring, which would justify the higher amounts of IL\u201010 protein detected in this case. Alternatively, maintenance of the Il10 mRNA could result from increased Il10 mRNA stability, as previously shown for macrophages (Teixeira\u2010Coelho et al., 2014). To investigate this hypothesis, microglia were stimulated with TLR2 or TLR2/TLR3 and at 1 hr poststimulation actinomycin D was added to the cultures and the IL\u201010 transcription followed for an extra 90 min. A similar decline in the detection of IL\u201010 either in single or combined stimulation was observed (Figure 2e). Therefore, the combination of TLR3 with TLR2 triggering led to enhanced IL\u201010 transcription, rather than enhanced mRNA stability, thus explaining the higher levels of IL\u201010 produced by microglia upon TLR2/TLR3 co\u2010stimulation.",

Considering the cytokine landscape obtained upon TLR3 triggering of microglia (Figure 1), if such mechanism was operating, the best candidate molecule would be IFN\u2010\u03b2, as it is strongly induced by TLR3 (Figure 1g) and it has been described to potentiate IL\u201010 in studies performed with bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages and dendritic cells (Iyer, Ghaffari, & Cheng, 2010; F. W. McNab et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011). Furthermore, we observed an early transcription of the Ifnb gene downstream of TLR3 signaling in microglia (Figure 3a), which suggested that IFN\u2010\u03b2 would be produced early enough to modulate the second Il10 transcriptional wave. Also, in line with the protein data (Figure 1g), no Ifnb transcription was observed upon TLR2 stimulation of microglia (Figure 3a). To test the role of IFN\u2010\u03b2 in inducing IL\u201010 in microglia, we generated microglia from WT or IFNAR deficient mice, which do not respond to type I IFNs (IFN\u2010\u03b2 or IFN\u2010\u03b1). Although IL\u201010 production in response to single TLR2 or TLR3 stimulation was not affected by the absence of IFNAR, microglia deficient for this receptor failed to upregulate IL\u201010 production 24 hr poststimulation with TLR2 and TLR3 (Figure 3b). Thus, our findings strongly suggest that the production of type I IFN downstream of TLR3 triggering is a key event for the modulation of IL\u201010 production by this receptor. To further validate these findings, we compared the amount of IL\u201010 secreted by microglia co\u2010stimulated with TLR2/TLR3 or with TLR2 in combination with recombinant IFN\u2010\u03b2. As shown in Figure 3c, treatment of microglia with recombinant IFN\u2010\u03b2 did not induce IL\u201010 on its own, but enhanced it when combined with TLR2 stimulation. Furthermore, the transcriptional profile of the Il10 gene upon co\u2010stimulation of microglia with TLR2 and IFN\u2010\u03b2 was similar to that observed for TLR2/TLR3 (Figure 3d) and the Il10 mRNA stability was not altered by IFN\u2010\u03b2 (Figure 3e).",

To investigate if this was the case, we run the multiplex panel in supernatants from microglia stimulated with TLR2 in combination with TLR3 (Figure 4).

This cytokine has previously been implicated in the regulation of IL\u201010 production by macrophages in some reports (Iyer et al., 2010). We thus questioned whether IL\u201027 could play a role in inducing IL\u201010 by TLR2\u2010activated microglia. Because IL\u201010 enhancement upon TLR3 triggering depended on IFNAR (Figure 3b), we first measured IL\u201027 production in WT or IFNAR\u2010deficient microglia activated via TLR2/TLR3. IL\u201027 production by TLR2/TLR3 stimulated microglia was diminished in the absence of IFNAR (Figure 4l). We then assessed whether IL\u201027 would augment IL\u201010 production by TLR2\u2010stimulated microglia. As before, stimulation of microglia with TLR2 and IFN\u2010\u03b2 augmented the production of IL\u201010 (Figure 4m). However, this was not observed when IFN\u2010\u03b2 was replaced by IL\u201027, nor did the addition of both IFN\u2010\u03b2 and IL\u201027 to the cultures further increased IL\u201010 production (Figure 4m). Of note, stimulation of microglia with either recombinant cytokine in the absence of TLR2 did not result in IL\u201010 production (Figure 4m). Therefore, the increase in IL\u201010 secretion by TLR3/TLR2\u2010stimulated microglia seems to be directly potentiated by IFN\u2010\u03b2, with no major role for IL\u201027.",

Furthermore, this IL\u201010 enhancement is not accompanied by an overshoot of the microglia response. These findings are interesting because IL\u201010 expression in the brain has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for a series of neurological diseases with an immune component, such as MS, Parkinson's disease, and brain injury (Kwilasz et al., 2015). Furthermore, because IFN\u2010\u03b2 is currently used in the clinics to treat MS patients, it is tempting to speculate that it may exert its local action by promoting IL\u201010 secretion. However, in the case of complex diseases such as MS, the immune environment generated in the CNS also comprises T\u2010cell\u2010derived cytokines, notably IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u201017. To understand whether the presence of these cytokines would impact on the modulation of IL\u201010 by TLR3 signaling, we stimulated microglia via TLR2 and TLR3 and combined this with increasing doses of recombinant IL\u201017 or IFN\u2010\u03b3.

Therefore, the successful modulation of IL\u201010 production in microglia by TLR3 or IFN\u2010\u03b2 will clearly depend on the immune composition of the tissue microenvironment, a factor that needs to be taken into account in IL\u201010\u2010based therapies.",

Pathways for initiating inflammation include an expanding number of cellular sensors, namely the TLR family. Members of this family are expressed on innate immune cells, including microglia cells and astrocytes (Holley et al., 2012; Kawai & Akira, 2010). Activation of microglia through TLRs, and other PRRs, plays an important role in initiating innate immune responses that protect the CNS from aggressions, such as the presence of pathogens, and that promote tissue regeneration after injury (Okun et al., 2009). However, cumulative evidence show that persistently activated microglia, and reactive astrocytes, can also contribute to pathogenesis of several types of CNS diseases, such as MS (Goverman, 2011; Okun et al., 2009). Therefore, microglial cells may contribute to either neuroprotection or neurodegeneration, depending on the setting and the context they are in. Consequently, switching microglial responses toward neuroprotection may be beneficial in different diseases, for example, in MS (Weiner, 2008). In this setting, the modulation of IL\u201010 production by activated microglia might prove of interest.",

            "text": "Several studies addressed the importance of TLRs in MS pathology, showing that the expression of these receptors is increased in brain lesions of both MS and EAE (Bsibsi, Ravid, Gveric, & van Noort, 2002). Interestingly, whereas activation of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 is detrimental in MS and EAE (Prinz et al., 2006; Visser et al., 2005), that of TLR3 protects from disease (Gooshe et al., 2014; Touil, Fitzgerald, Zhang, Rostami, & Gran, 2006). We started this study by looking at the inflammatory landscape of microglia triggered by these TLRs. We found that, overall, TLR3 was the least inflammatory TLR, as only low cytokine levels were detected upon activation of microglia with polyI:C, a TLR3 agonist. This poor reactivity of TLR3 may underlie its protective nature in EAE (Gooshe et al., 2014). Furthermore, TLR3 triggering led to pronounced IFN\u2010\u03b2 secretion, a molecule that is currently used to treat MS patients (Plosker, 2011; Trojano et al., 2009) and which presence is protective in EAE (Goldmann et al., 2016; Touil et al., 2006). However, in apparent contrast with these data, we found that another protective cytokine in EAE (Bettelli et al., 1998), the anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine IL\u201010, was poorly induced downstream of TLR3. In the context of MS or EAE, tissue inflammation is accompanied by cellular death, which releases several DAMPs and propagates microglia reactivity. It is therefore most likely that several TLRs, and indeed other PRRs, get activated. When TLR3 activation was combined with that of the other tested TLRs, a significant increase on the production of IL\u201010 was observed. Importantly, this increase of IL\u201010 production as a result of combined TLR2/TLR3 stimulation of microglia has a functional impact. Indeed, whereas the production of IL\u201012 downstream of TLR2 or TLR3 stimulation is only mildly increased in IL\u201010\u2010deficient microglia, it is markedly enhanced in co\u2010stimulated microglia, in the absence of IL\u201010 (Supporting Information, Figure 4). Thus, the enhancement of IL\u201010 in TLR2/TLR3 co\u2010stimulated microglia appears to hamper proinflammatory responses. We narrowed the regulation of IL\u201010 by TLR3 down to a positive feedback loop involving IFN\u2010\u03b2 that mechanistically induced a second wave of Il10 gene transcription, but did not affect the stability of the Il10 mRNA. This observation mirrors the effect of IFN\u2010\u03b2 in innate immune cells of the periphery (Iyer et al., 2010; McNab et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011), supporting the existence of transversal mechanisms operating in circulating versus resident macrophages, such as microglia. We herein also show that the production of IL\u201010 by TLR\u2010activated microglia follows a pattern similar to that observed in conventional macrophages derived from the bone marrow. TLR3 is the sole TLR signaling only via the TRIF pathway (Kawai & Akira, 2010), which has been previously involved in sustaining the stability of the Il10 mRNA in bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages (Teixeira\u2010Coelho et al., 2014). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that cell\u2010specific mechanisms are also in place, to ensure specificity in the regulation of IL\u201010. Pinpointing the common, and the cell\u2010specific, mechanisms regulating this cytokine is critical if tailor\u2010made interventions are to be envisaged.",

            "text": "The protective role for TLR3 in MS and EAE appears to be associated with the triggering of neuroprotective responses in astrocytes (Bsibsi et al., 2010), but also with the release of IFN\u2010\u03b2 (Touil et al., 2006) and of IL\u201027 (Fitzgerald et al., 2007) by innate immune cells of the periphery. In EAE, lack of endogenous IFN\u2010\u03b2 in the CNS leads to augmented microglia activation, resulting in a sustained inflammation, cytokine production, and tissue damage with consequent chronic neurological deficits (Teige et al., 2003) in support of an anti\u2010inflammatory role for this molecule. Furthermore, expression of IFN\u2010\u03b2 within the CNS (Khorooshi et al., 2015), including in microglia (Kocur et al., 2015), plays a protective role in EAE. Other studies further link IFN\u2010\u03b2 therapy with an enhancement of IL\u201010 in MS and an accompanying inhibition of T helper (Th) 17 cell responses (Krakauer, Sorensen, Khademi, Olsson, & Sellebjerg, 2008; Kvarnstrom, Ydrefors, Ekerfelt, Vrethem, & Ernerudh, 2013; Ramgolam, Sha, Jin, Zhang, & Markovic\u2010Plese, 2009; Sweeney et al., 2011), but all do so in immune cells of the periphery. We now reveal another protective action of IFN\u2010\u03b2, by directly targeting microglia leading to enhanced IL\u201010 and IL\u201027, both protective cytokines in MS. At least in microglia, these events seem to be unrelated, with the IFN\u2010\u03b2 potentiation of IL\u201010 being independent of IL\u201027. This is in line with other studies performed in macrophages (McNab et al., 2014) and contrasts with a possible role of IL\u201027 in promoting IL\u201010 production by myeloid cells (Iyer et al., 2010) and effector Th cells (Freitas do Rosario et al., 2012). As mentioned above, the response to IFN\u2010\u03b2 therapy in MS has been correlated with an inhibition of Th17 cells (Krakauer et al., 2008; Kvarnstrom et al., 2013; Ramgolam et al., 2009; Sweeney et al., 2011). As herein shown, the direct effect of IFN\u2010\u03b2 in potentiating IL\u201010 secretion by TLR\u2010activated microglia would still occur in the context of IL\u201017, but would be largely compromised in the presence of IFN\u2010\u03b3. The role of IFN\u2010\u03b3 in modulating IL\u201010 production by microglia is still not fully understood, but it is likely dependent on the activation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)\u20103 (Green & Nolan, 2012). It is interesting to note that low amounts of IFN\u2010\u03b3 were detected upon stimulation of the microglia cultures with TLR2, 4, and 9 agonists, but not upon TLR3 triggering. Yet, this pattern of endogenous IFN\u2010\u03b3 production was not related to that of IL\u201010 expression. The fact that absence of IFN\u2010\u03b3 under TLR3 stimulation did not license IL\u201010 production fits with the mechanism we propose, where low IL\u201010 triggering in response to TLR3 stimulation is related to deficient basic transcriptional activity. In further support of an independent endogenous IFN\u2010\u03b3 vs IL\u201010 production, blocking of IFN\u2010\u03b3 with a neutralizing antibody did not alter IL\u201010 secretion by TLR2\u2010stimulated microglia (Supporting Information, Figure 5). In sum, by using an in vitro model of neonate microglia activation, our study illustrates the complexity of the events regulating microglial responses, providing hints to possible mechanisms operating in the adult brain in the context of EAE. It will be important to now probe these mechanisms in vivo, by resorting to various genetically modified mice and to also address the effects of microglia modulation on adjacent cells, notably on neurons.",

In a recent study, the most common mouse backgrounds used in laboratory research (Balb/c and C57BL/6) were shown to bear important differences in the ability of their macrophages to produce IL\u201010 in response to TLR triggering (Howes et al., 2016). These differences were related to a differential induction of IFN\u2010\u03b2 in either background (Howes et al., 2016). If the same differences apply to microglia, the use of either mouse strain to induce EAE may lead to distinct results. In line with a possible impact of the mouse genetic background in the response of microglia to TLR activation, previous studies reported IFN\u2010\u03b2 production downstream of TLR9 activation in microglia generated from IRW mice (Butchi et al., 2010). This was not the case in our study, where C57BL/6 mice were used (Figure 1d).",
