            "text": "Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) is a condition characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the bronchiolar walls resulting in narrowing or obliteration of the bronchiolar lumen. The most common causes are childhood lower respiratory tract infection, hematopoietic stem cell or lung and heart-lung transplantation, and toxic fume inhalation. The most frequent clinical manifestations are progressive dyspnea and dry cough. Pulmonary function tests demonstrate airflow obstruction and air trapping. Radiographic manifestations include reduction of the peripheral vascular markings, increased lung lucency, and overinflation. The chest radiograph, however, is often normal. High-resolution CT is currently the imaging modality of choice in the assessment of patients with suspected or proven OB. The characteristic findings on high-resolution CT consist of areas of decreased attenuation and vascularity (mosaic perfusion pattern) on inspiratory scans and air trapping on expiratory scans. Other CT findings of OB include bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis, bronchial wall thickening, small centrilobular nodules, and three-in-bud opacities. Recent studies suggest that hyperpolarized 3 He-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging may allow earlier recognition of obstructive airway disease and therefore may be useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with OB.",

Several classification schemes have been proposed based on histologic features, etiology, or computed tomography (CT) findings (1) (2) (3) 6, 7) . Although none of these classification schemes is widely accepted and there is controversy about the classification of some of the subtypes of bronchiolitis, there is overall agreement on the histologic, radiologic, and clinical features of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB).",

The histologic hallmark of BOOP is the presence of buds of loose granulation tissue, termed Masson bodies, within alveolar ducts and air spaces, that is, organizing pneumonia (1, 2, 12) . The patients may or may not have granulation polyps within terminal and respiratory bronchioles, but they rarely have fibrosis within the bronchiolar walls or peribronchiolar tissues, that is, they do not have OB. Because the predominant clinical, histologic, and radiologic manifestations of BOOP are those of organizing pneumonia, the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society multidisciplinary consensus classification recommended that the term BOOP be replaced by the term organizing pneumonia and idiopathic BOOP by cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (12) . Organizing pneumonia may result from various causes or underlying pathologic processes including pulmonary infection, aspiration, collagen vascular disorders, drugs, radiation, inhalational injury, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is currently classified as a form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (12, 13) and is beyond the scope of this chapter. We will limit our discussion to the histologic, clinical, and radiologic findings of OB.",

It should be noted that even on surgical biopsy specimens, subtle changes or completely distorted and scarred bronchioles may be missed on routine hematoxylin-eosin stains. Optimal assessment requires the use of elastic tissue stains (Fig. 3) (2,14) . Because of the subtlety of the histologic findings, lung biopsies in patients with BO may occasionally be read as normal or near-normal. In such patients, the presence of typical imaging findings should prompt a request for review, re-staining, or re-sectioning of the biopsy specimen. ",

Recently, it has been shown that magnetic resonance (MR) allows functional imaging of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion with the additional benefit of lack of radiation (29) . Hyperpolarized 3 He-enhanced MR may allow earlier recognition of obstructive airway disease and therefore be useful in the early recognition and follow-up of patients with OB (30, 31) .

The areas of decreased attenuation result from decreased perfusion of hypoventilated alveoli distal to obstructed bronchioles. The abnormalities may be subtle on inspiratory images. The presence of airflow obstruction and air trapping is usually easier to detect on CT scans performed during maximal expiration or at end-expiration (48) (49) (50) (51) . Regions with airflow obstruction because of OB show no decrease in volume or less decrease in volume than the adjacent uninvolved lung and therefore remain lucent while the remaining lung increases in attenuation. This results in increased contrast between areas with airflow obstruction and normal lung facilitating recognition of air trapping on high-resolution CT (Fig. 6 ). Expiratory CT images may demonstrate air trapping in patients with normal findings on inspiratory scans ( Fig. 7 ) (48, 50, (52) (53) (54) (55) . The extent of air trapping on expiratory CT in patients with OB correlates with severity of airflow obstruction and air trapping on pulmonary function tests (18) . CT performed during maximal expiratory maneuver or at end-expiration therefore plays an important role and is recommended in the initial evaluation and follow-up of patients with OB (50,52). Several studies have suggested that post-processing of high-resolution CT images particularly with the use of minimum intensity projection (MinIP) reconstructions improves the detection of subtle areas of low attenuation encountered in patients with emphysema and small airways disease (Fig. 8) . (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) (61) These techniques may be particularly helpful in patients with high clinical suspicion for OB and otherwise apparently normal CT findings.",

It should be emphasized, however, that mosaic perfusion is a nonspecific finding seen in a number of conditions, that mild air trapping is commonly seen in normal subjects, and that there is overlap between the high-resolution CT manifestations of OB and the findings seen in other causes of airway obstruction such as asthma and emphysema (19) . Mosaic perfusion can be seen in various airway diseases including OB, asthma, and bronchiectasis; in occlusive pulmonary vascular disease (particularly chronic pulmonary thromboembolism) (Fig. 11) ; and infiltrative lung disease, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis (45, 52, (63) (64) (65) (66) . The differential diagnosis requires careful analysis of associated findings such as bronchial dilatation and enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and interpretation of the CT images in the proper clinical context. Airway diseases that cause mosaic perfusion can usually be distinguished from vascular causes such as chronic pulmonary thromboembolism by the presence of bronchial dilatation, seen in more than 70% of patients with airway abnormalities, and the lack of enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, a finding seen in the majority of patients with chronic pulmonary thromboembolism associated with mosaic perfusion (45) . It should be noted however that bronchial dilatation may also occur in patients with chronic pulmonary thromboembolism (67) , and there are no reliable distinguishing features between mosaic perfusion resulting from OB and mosaic perfusion because of other airway diseases. Furthermore, air trapping can also be seen in patients with pulmonary embolism. In a study by Arakawa et al. (68) , air trapping at expiratory images was identified in 9 of 15 (60%) patients with pulmonary embolism, including four with acute pulmonary embolism, one with chronic pulmonary embolism, and four with acute and chronic pulmonary embolism.",

Lobular air trapping involving fewer than three adjacent secondary pulmonary lobules (48) can be seen in approximately 50% of asymptomatic subjects and in various clinical settings, including OB, cigarette smoking, asthma, bronchiolitis associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Fig. 13) , and sarcoidosis (64) (65) (66) 73, (75) (76) (77) . Extent of air trapping, not simply its presence, therefore needs to be taken into account in the interpretation of expiratory CT scans (48, 73) . It has been shown that mosaic perfusion and air trapping can be considered abnormal when they affect an area of more than 25% of the total area of the lung (48, 73) and are not limited to the superior segment of the lower lobe or the lingula tip (48) . The presence of additional CT features in areas of decreased attenuation is also valuable in differentiating between abnormal air trapping in patients with OB and normal subjects. In a review of the high-resolution CT findings of 15 patients with pathologically proven OB after lung transplantation and 18 control subjects, the combination of bronchial dilatation on the inspiratory CT scan and air trapping on the expiratory CT scan was seen only in patients with OB and were the two most sensitive and specific findings on high-resolution CT scans of patients with OB (46) . Copley et al. (19) assessed the discriminatory value of high-resolution CT to distinguish between OB, asthma, centrilobular emphysema, panlobular emphysema, and normal controls. A correct firstchoice diagnosis was made in 199 of 276 (72%) observations, and a correct first-choice diagnosis was made in 35 of 38 (92%) observations in patients with OB. The major sources of diagnostic inaccuracy were difficulty in differentiating between panlobular and centrilobular emphysema, asthma and normality, and asthma and OB. Distinguishing features between OB and panlobular emphysema because of 1 -antitrypsin deficiency were the presence of parenchymal destruction, vascular distortion, High-resolution CT image shows bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities, fine reticulation, and mild subpleural honeycombing (arrowhead). Also noted are a few lobules with decreased attenuation and vascularity (straight arrow). (B) Expiratory high-resolution CT scan at the same level as (A) demonstrates air trapping in lobules that had decreased attenuation on the inspiratory CT (straight arrow) and in other lung regions (curved arrows). The lobular areas of air trapping are presumably related to obliterative bronchiolitis and the ground-glass opacities due to interstitial lymphocytic infiltration. and linear scars or thickened septa at the lung bases in most patients with panlobular emphysema (Fig. 14) . Patients with OB were more likely to have bronchial dilatation and decreased parenchymal attenuation and vascularity than asthmatics patients. The authors concluded that high-resolution CT is helpful to distinguish diseases that cause airflow obstruction, and it is particularly accurate in the identification of OB (19) . Jensen et al. (47) compared the CT findings in patients with refractory asthma with those of patients with idiopathic OB. A mosaic pattern of lung attenuation was seen in 50% of OB patients compared with only 3% of patients with refractory asthma. ",

Less common causes include connective tissue disorders (especially rheumatoid arthritis) (84) (85) (86) (87) (88) (89) (90) , drug therapy including d-penicillamine, lamustine and gold (5, 91) , ingestion of toxines such as Sauropous androgyn (92) (93) (94) , neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia with multiple carcinoid tumorlets (95) (96) (97) , inflammatory bowel disease (98, 99) , eosinophilic fasciitis (3, 5) , Stevens-Johnson syndrome and paraneoplastic pemphigus (100, 101) . OB may be seen as a component of interstitial lung disease (hypersensitivity pneumonitis and sarcoidosis) (64, 75, 76) or large airway disease (asthma, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis) (102) (103) (104) (105) .

            "text": "Obliterative bronchiolitis may be a late sequela of lower respiratory tract infections occurring in infancy or childhood, particularly by adenovirus (40, 107, 108) . Other causes include respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, measles, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (5, 109) . The true prevalence of OB due to infection is unknown; however, it has been estimated that approximately 1% of the patients with acute viral bronchiolitis develop postinfectious OB (110) . The diagnosis of postinfectious OB in the childhood is based on history of lower airway infection, usually acute viral bronchiolitis, followed by persistent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The time interval between the acute illness and the development of postinfectious OB is generally 6 months (range 1-42 months) (111) . In the majority of the cases, the condition does not become apparent until adulthood. Most patients with postinfectious OB are asymptomatic or present with mild-to-moderate clinical findings and have a good prognosis (40, 78, 112) . Occasionally, severe and sometimes fatal disease may occur (112, 113) . In a prospective study performed to define the clinical course and the prognosis of 31 patients who had symptomatic postinfectious OB during a mean of 3.5 years of follow-up, clinical remission was identified in 23% of the patients, persistence of respiratory symptoms in 68%, and death in approximately 10% (112) . Lung transplantation or lung volume reduction surgery should be considered for patients who show persistent and severe obstructive symptoms and progressive impairment in lung function (114) . The chest radiograph may be normal or show various findings including unilateral hyperlucency of a lobe or lung; bilateral hyperlucent lungs; complete collapse of the affected lobe; a mixed pattern of hyperlucency and persistent collapse; and peribronchial thickening (78) . High-resolution CT usually demonstrates bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, mosaic perfusion, and air trapping (see Figs 7 and 15) (109,115) .",

            "text": "Obliterative bronchiolitis is a common and important complication of lung and heart-lung transplantation and remains the single leading cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The prevalence of OB following lung transplantation is approximately 20% at 1 year and greater than 50% at 3-5 years (79, (120) (121) (122) (123) . OB is the primary cause of death in 30% of the affected individuals after the third postoperative year and more than half of affected individuals after 5 years (120, 121, 123, 124) . Clinically, OB typically is first recognized 16-20 months after transplantation although it may manifest as early as the second or third month after transplantation (80, 125, 126) . OB is believed to be a manifestation of chronic rejection. Although by definition OB is a pathologic diagnosis, histologic confirmation is difficult to obtain. The reported sensitivity of transbronchial biopsy ranges from 15 to 87% and the specificity approximately 75% (21) (22) (23) 25, 26) . Surgical biopsy is seldom performed on these patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage is usually nonspecific and may show neutrophilic and/or lymphocytic inflammation (127, 128) . However, transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage are important in excluding other possible diagnoses as contributing causes of deteriorating pulmonary function in patients with lung transplantation and heart-lung transplantation, such as acute rejection and infection (129, 130) . Because of the low sensitivity of transbronchial biopsy in demonstrating OB, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation has established the concept of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and a staging system to quantify the severity of airflow obstruction (131) . According to the revised classification system, the staging is based on the reduction in the forced expiration volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) and mid-expiratory flow rate (FEF 25\u221275 ) , in comparison with baseline post-transplant values, with or without histologic documentation of OB, and the exclusion of other causes for the functional abnormality (132) . On the basis of the severity of functional impairment, BOS can be subdivided into five different categories: BOS 0 (FEV 1 > 90% of baseline, and FEF 25\u221275 > 75% of baseline), BOS 0-p (potential OB; FEV 1 81-90% of baseline, and/or FEF 25\u221275 \u2264 75% of baseline), BOS 1 (mild OB; FEV 1 66-80% of baseline), BOS 2 (moderate OB; FEV 1 51-65% of baseline), and BOS 3 (severe OB; FEV 1 \u2264 50% of baseline).",

Clinical symptoms include malaise, dry cough, and shortness of breath on exertion. Sputum production at presentation is typically absent; however, repeated episodes of bacterial infection, followed by permanent airway colonization with pathogenic bacteria and fungi (e.g., Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus spp. and Aspergillus fumigatus), may result in productive cough later in the course of the disease (134) .",

Gastroesophageal reflux with occult microaspiration that may promote chronic inflammation and bacterial infections in the lower airways may be a potential risk factor for BOS (145, 146) . The etiology of post-transplant gastroesophageal reflux is probable multifactorial and includes intraoperative vagal injury, drug-induced prolonged gastric emptying, and impaired lower esophageal sphincter function (145) (146) (147) (148) . Preliminary studies suggest that antireflux surgery, such as fundoplication, may improve lung function in some of these patients (149) . Risk factors for OB among allogeneic recipients are probably also multifactorial and include acute and chronic GVHD, older donor and recipient age, myeloablative conditioning, methotrexate use, antecedent respiratory infection, and serum immunoglobulin deficiency (81, 82, 150) .",

            "text": "Lung function is currently the gold standard for detecting chronic allograft dysfunction in transplanted patients. High-resolution CT is a valuable tool in the evaluation and follow-up of transplanted patients (Fig. 18 ). CT is a direct measure of the lung structure and allows the identification of structural abnormalities associated with chronic allograft dysfunction, including bronchiectasis, airway wall thickening, mucus in small and large airways, and air trapping because of small airway abnormalities (see Figs 8 and 9) . The presence of air trapping on expiratory high-resolution CT scans is the most sensitive and accurate radiologic indicator of OB following transplantation (46, (154) (155) (156) (157) (158) . High-resolution CT has been used to predict BOS in both adults and children; however, more recent studies have shown that the value of air trapping at expiratory high-resolution CT before the clinical appearance and during the early stages of BOS is lower than previously reported (154, 156) . The reported sensitivities and specificities of air trapping range from 44 to 91% and 80 to 100%, respectively (46, (154) (155) (156) (157) (158) . This variability may be due to differences in the technique used to quantify the extent of air trapping, patient selection with inclusion of heart-lung or bilateral-lung and single-lung transplant recipients and predate the revised criteria for BOS, which are believed to be more sensitive for the detection of early-stage BOS (132) . Furthermore, most studies included high-resolution CT scans that were obtained after clinical diagnosis of OB. In a recent study, Konen et al. (154) assessed the value of CT findings in predicting BOS before its clinical appearance and during the early stages of BOS. The authors found lower sensitivity for air trapping (44-50%) than previously reported (74-91%) (155) (156) (157) (158) . The sensitivities of mosaic perfusion, bronchiectasis, and bronchial wall thickening were even lower, not exceeding 25% (154, 158, 159) . The limitations of high-resolution CT are also at least in part because of the inter-and intra-observer variability in the interpretation of the CT images and the different scoring systems used to quantify the extent of air trapping on CT (154, 156, 157, 160) . A composite CT score system may have a potential role in the early detection of OB in lung transplant recipients, as demonstrated in a recent study with good intra-and inter-observer agreement (161) . Preliminary studies have shown that functional MR imaging using hyperpolarized 3-He detects BOS earlier than spirometry or high-resolution CT (31, 162) . The main limitations of functional MR imaging are high cost and limited availability. It therefore currently remains an investigational modality.",

The acute phase of Silo filler's disease typically manifests within minutes or hours after exposure and usually resolves within hours (83) . The main clinical symptoms consist of cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and cyanosis. Patients may develop pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). If the patient survives, a progressive and irreversible obstructive ventilatory defect may be noted 2-5 weeks later (83) . At the late stage, the radiologic findings are similar to those of OB because of other causes. Other toxic gases associated with OB include ammonia, chlorine, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen selenide, sulfur dioxide, and fire smoke (3, 5) . Recently, diacetyl (2,3-butanedione), a ketone with butter-flavor characteristics, was the predominant compound isolated in workers in a microwave popcorn plant (163, 164) , who developed clinical, histologic, and imaging findings of OB (163) . Some of these patients developed severe symptoms and required lung transplantation.",

The patients had moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction without response to bronchodilator therapy or prednisolone. The chest radiographs were normal, and high-resolution CT demonstrated bilateral bronchiectasis and patchy mosaic perfusion at inspiratory CT in 11 of 23 patients and air trapping at expiratory scans in all patients.

            "text": "Neuroendocrine (Kulchitzky) cells are commonly found in the basal layer of the surface epithelium and in the bronchial glands from the level of the main bronchi to the proximal bronchioles. Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) is a rare condition characterized by proliferation of neuroendocrine cells as clusters of cells or as linear arrays along the basement membrane (95, 177) . DIPNECH is regarded as a precursor to the development of carcinoid tumorlets, which consist of nodular proliferations (diameter <5 mm) of airway neuroendocrine cells that extend beyond the epithelium into the adjacent wall or lung parenchyma. If such a lesion exceeds 5 mm in diameter, it is regarded as a carcinoid tumor (177) (178) (179) . Aguayo et al. (95) reported the clinical and pathologic findings of six lifelong nonsmokers who had diffuse hyperplasia of airway neuroendocrine cells and multiple pulmonary carcinoid tumorlets associated with OB and airway obstruction. The OB in these patients is postulated to be secondary to a combination of intraluminal obstruction by hyperplastic neuroendocrine cells and peribronchiolar fibrosis presumably secondary to peptide secretory products released by the proliferating neuroendocrine cells (95, 180) . The patients are usually women in their fifth or sixth decade and have history of long-standing progressive respiratory distress (>10 years) and persistent cough with mild-to-moderate airflow obstruction at lung function tests (96) . The chest radiograph is usually normal. The most common high-resolution CT findings are mosaic perfusion at inspiratory CT and air trapping at expiratory images. Other high-resolution CT findings include bronchial wall thickening, a few dilated bronchi and occasional well-defined nodules measuring 0.2-1.5 mm in diameter that correspond to the carcinoid tumorlets and carcinoid tumors identified histologically (Fig. 20) (96, 97, 178, 181) .",
