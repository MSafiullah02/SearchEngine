Objective: to identify the most vulnerable populations during the epidemic period (including individuals with affective disorders) who are most in need of psychological and / or psychiatric help. Material and methods: on-line survey of 1957 Russian-speaking respondents over 18 years old from March 30 to April 5, 2020. The level of anxiety distress was verified with the psychological stress scale (PSM-25). Stigmatization of individuals experiencing respiratory symptoms was assessed with modified devaluation / discrimination questionnaire (PDD; Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.707). Results: 99.8% of respondents had variable concerns associated with COVID-19. Their mean scores of psychological stress were increased to moderate levels (104.9 \u00b1 34.4 points), and the stigmatization scores exceeded the value of the whole sample median (19.5 \u00b1 3.4; Me = 19). 35% of respondents had concerns about COVID-19 associated with anxiety distress (Cohen's d = 0.16-0.39): these were \"risk of isolation\" and \"possible lack of medication for daily use\". The most prone to concerns were respondents' groups with affective disorders, young people (\u226420 years old), unemployed, single, those without higher education and women. Conclusions: large sub-cohorts of the Russian-speaking sample need correction of anxiety distress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation of such measures should be targeted and oriented in terms of coverage and content to identified vulnerable social groups.",

It is due to this individual's high sensitivity to stress compared to the general population, and also due to limitations of the scheduled psychiatric outpatient appointments.

It is important to note that, among the 688 participants who had at least one of the two main concern themes associated with psychological stress, respondents without mental disorders were as common as those with affective disorders. An unexpected confirmation of the online questionnaire external validity was the identified prevalence of a specific concern for individuals with anxiety disorders about their life safety that distinguished them from respondents with mood disorders (Table 4 ). In addition to traditional populations considered most vulnerable to anxiety reactions (patients with affective and somatic disorders) many other cohorts have demonstrated various prevailing concerns about COVID-19. Women were more likely than men to worry about the absence of individual protective equipment in open sale and to fear for their own lives (Table  4 ). Single and unmarried participants, unemployed and employed in state institutions were more likely to fear isolation (Table 5 ). Among respondents with higher education or academic degrees, as well as those over 31 years of age, there were significantly fewer concerns about the risk of isolation. A category of participants over 60 years of age tended to be more afraid of possible financial difficulties because of the pandemic (Table 6 ). All rights reserved.

Because of that they can be considered within the framework of adaptive personality and psychological reactions. At the same time, the expansion of the concern themes led to the breakdown of adaptive mechanisms, provoking both the intensification of psychological and social stress. Increase in psychological stress manifested in higher anxiety, while social stress consciously or unconsciously was projected outside, causing increased stigma. It is important to emphasize that psychological stress escalated especially amid concerns about the \"possible lack of medications for daily use\" and the \"risk of isolation\". In the first case such concerns are apparently associated with deterioration in subjective perception, and in the second casewith quarantine measures themselves provoking a wave of anxiety and anger. The increase in stigmatization attitudes turned out to be associated to the greatest extent with the following experiences: \"fear for one's own life\", \"infectiousness of the virus\", and \"lack off protective equipment sales\", which are, to a greater extent, caused by the feeling of loss of control over the situation.",

Intervention in a psychological crisis should be considered as an important part of a public health response to the outbreak of COVID-19. The first step should be the widespread involvement of competent professionals in the area of infectious diseases, epidemiology and mental health in order to inform citizens about effective measures to limit the further spread of infection and ways to prevent the increase in stress in the media, as opposed to amateurish judgments that flood the Internet. Furthermore, our data allow us to recommend the correction of distress concerns broadly, but also with more precision. Predominant attention should be paid not only to patients with affective disorders, but also to young people; women; individuals without higher education, not employed in labor or educational activities, single and unmarried. The most urgent need for correction of anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic was identified in the concerns about the possible lack of medications for daily use and the risk of isolation, since these types of experiences are associated with the maximum increase in anxiety distress in the evaluated sample. It is necessary to create access to individual psychological counseling on-line at the state level and provide psychological and psychiatric assistance to those in need, while ensuring adequate epidemiological safety. The timely provision of psychological and psychiatric care to the ones in need is especially important, since psychological stability also contributes to the preservation of the physical health of the population.",
