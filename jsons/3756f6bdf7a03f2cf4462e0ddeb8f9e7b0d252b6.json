This reaction is also referred to as a type I hypersensitivity reaction [8] . Atopic subjects have a family history of atopic eczema, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and allergic asthma and therefore are genetically predisposed to develop these diseases. IgE, the principle mediator of the immediate hypersensitivity reaction, attaches to mast cells present in blood vessels of connective tissues and mucosal membranes. Nonatopic subjects also produce IgE and have mast cells; however, because of their genetic predisposition (family history) and allergen exposure, atopic subjects become sensitized to specific allergens. When exposed to an allergen to which they are allergic, they develop an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, causing acute and chronic allergic rhinosinusitis and allergic asthma.

When aerosolized cat saliva and pelt proteins, sources of cat allergens, are inhaled, these allergens are absorbed onto mucosal surfaces, in this case, in the nose. Two IgE molecules located on a mast cell are bridged by the cat allergen, triggering the mast cell to release stored and newly generated vasoactive amines, such as histamine and proteases. They also generate and secrete products of arachidonic acid, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These mediators cause an inflammatory response, vascular dilation, increased vascular permeability, and the recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils, and Th2 cells (Fig. 5.2a, b) . They also cause smooth muscle contraction in the bronchi, responsible for the bronchial constriction is introduced via inhalation and is processed by the antigenpresenting cell (APC). The allergen is degraded into small amino acid chains and subsequently displayed on the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) for specific T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition. Once the specific TCR recognizes the processed allergen on MHC II, a series of events occur leading to T-cell activation. Activated T cells interact with specific B cells and become activated. Activated B cells, with the help of interleukin 4 (IL-4), undergo immunoglobulin class switching. Class-switched B cells become plasma cells and begin producing immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to the allergen. Secreted IgE coat mast cells. (b) Upon re-exposure to an identical allergen, IgE attaches to mast cells via high-affinity IgE receptors (Fc\u03b5RI) and recognizes the allergen, which cross-links IgE molecules. This cross-linking leads to mast cell degranulation and the secretion of stored and newly formed inflammatory mediators, e.g., histamine, heparin, prostaglandins (PGs), and various cytokines. These mediators are responsible for the early-and latephase signs and symptoms of IgE-mediated allergic diseases in allergic asthma. This inflammatory cascade triggers the symptoms of allergic rhinitis which includes sneezing, nasal itching, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion; with asthma, this inflammation causes cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath.
