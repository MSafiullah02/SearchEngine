            "text": "Diabetes in the BB rat is associated with autoimmunity not only to the pancreatic islet cells but also to other endocrine organ [1]; BB rats were found positive for autoantibodies to gastric parietal cells, thyroid colloid antigens, smooth muscle cells and thymocytes [2], [3]. The genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases is notoriously complex; however, the BB rat has proven to be a very useful model to dissect the genetics of organ specific autoimmunity [4], [5], [6], [7]. First, lymphopenia (lyp) on chromosome 4 is absolutely required for diabetes along with MHC RT1 u/u, on chromosome 20 [4], [8], [9]. To study the Iddm1/lyp locus in the absence of the other Iddm loci, we generated a congenic strain (DR.lyp), where lymphopenia (lyp) and Iddm1 from a line of inbred diabetic prone BB rats (BBDP) was introgressed on to the genome of inbred diabetes-resistant BB rats (BBDR) by marker assisted selection [10]. This congenic rat strain has confirmed that a single locus is responsible for both T cell lymphopenia and spontaneous autoimmune diabetes. In the 6 years since we completed the congenic DR.lyp line, and in all recombinant animals developed from this strain, we have never had an animal develop diabetes without lymphopenia (lyp). The lymphopenia gene (lyp) has a recessive mode of inheritance and in specific pathogen free (SPF) condition type 1 diabetes occur in 100% of homozygous lyp/lyp BB rats but not in lyp/+ or +/+ congenic DR.lyp animals [5], [10]. In our previous cross\u2013intercross analysis we showed that the MHC RT1 lv1/lv1 or u/lv1 was sufficient to protect lymphopenic lyp/lyp rats from developing diabetes [11], also demonstrating that RT1 u/u was a more important risk factor for thyroiditis than for lymphopenia [12]. The lymphopenia in diabetes prone BB rats [13], [14]is due to a mutation in a novel (Ian) related gene, Ian5\n[5], [6]. The frameshift mutation in Ian5 is linked to a marked reduction in both CD4+and CD8+T cell subsets in the peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs. Along with this, the RT6.1 differentiation marker (also known as Art2a) is markedly reduced and at the same time there is an increase in Thy.1 positive T cells [15]. While the specific mechanism of lymphopenia is still unclear, in order to more fully examine the consequences of the Ian5 mutation in different genetic background, we generated a congenic line F344.lyp rats in which the critical lyp region has been introgressed on to the diabetes-resistant F344 rat. To rapidly generate the F344.lyp rats (within 30 months breeding), we used marker-assisted selection (MAS). The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that introgression of the lymphopenia gene on to F344 rats would induce lymphopenia and tissue inflammation. That would depend on the F344 rat MHC RT1 lv1/lv1, and to produce a rat line in which the function of the defective rat Ian5 gene could be studied without the possible confounding factor of background T1DM.",

The rats were fed with standard diet (LabDiet, PMI Nutrition International, LLC, Brentwood, MO, USA). Sentinel animals were negative for the following viral antibodies and parasites (Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, sialodacryoadenitis virus, rat corona virus, Kilham's rat virus, rat parvovirus type 1, Mycoplasma pulmonis, pinworms, and fur mites) during the period of the experiments. F344 rats were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, USA). The parental DR.lyp/lyp rats were selected from our 10th cycle of (BB) cross-intercross between DP and DR rats [10]. These rats have the lyp gene introgressed on to the inbred DR rats and are referred to as DR.lyp rats. The congenic line was generated by MAS in five cycles of cross\u2013intercross breeding with whole genome scanning for F344 homozygosity at non-Lyp loci. At 25\u201330 days of age the rats were weaned and ear marked, a tail biopsy was taken to extract DNA for genotyping and at the same time peripheral blood was collected for T cell phenotyping.",

Initially, DR.lyp/lyp rats were mated with F344 rats to generate an intercross. A male rat from this intercross was then backcrossed to a female F344 rat, generating N2 rats. In the N2 generation a total genome scan was performed and one male N2 lyp/+ rat with the largest number of F344 alleles (that is, with the genome closest to our desired goal) was selected and crossed with a female F344 rat. Continuing with the same strategy, we produced an N5 generation and again used a total genome scan to select those animals to be used for inbreeding by sister\u2013brother intercross. As described below, those animals carried only the F344 alleles of markers outside the lyp region, and so the N5 lyp/+ rats were intercrossed to generate F1 rats, the founders of our line of F344.lyp congenic rats. As expected, these offspring carried the lyp/lyp, lyp/+ and +/+ genotype in a 1:2:1 ratio.",

The rats were healthy and did not develop any signs of diabetes, thyroiditis, tissue infiltration, inflammation or any other autoimmune disease. Our results therefore support the notion that lyp alone does not cause diabetes or thyroiditis which are both dependent on the u/u (or similar) genotype [12]. More importantly, there was no sign of any other autoimmune disease, which suggests that the lv1/lv1 MHC genotype in F344 rats is resistant to spontaneous organ-specific autoimmunity. Since both the sexes of the lyp/lyp rats gained weight normally as compared to lyp/+ and +/+ F344 rats we also conclude that lyp does not have any effect on body weight.",

The differences in percentages of CD4+CD8+and CD4\u2212CD8\u2212subsets between lyp/lyp and +/+ F344 rats indicate an abnormal differentiation of T cells in the F344.lyp/lyp rat thymus (Table 2). These findings were not consistent with earlier studies showing that the frequency of CD4+CD8+and CD4\u2212CD8\u2212subsets was not different between BBDP and BBDR [20], and BBDP/Ed and congenic lymphopenic PVG-lyp/lyp (RT1u) and (RT1c) rat thymocytes [19]. The increase in the percentage of CD4\u2212CD8+T cells in the thymus of F344.lyp rat is however not consistent with earlier studies showing a reduction in thymic CD8 single positive T cells. It should be noted that the extent of reduction in CD8 thymocyte numbers caused by the lyp defect might be influenced by other genes in the BB rat [19]. Differences were reported in the RT6+, Thy-1+, and CD25+T cell subsets in the congenic line F344.lypRT1u\n[21]. Our congenic line carrying the RT1.lv1/lv1 showed an increase in the percentage of Thy-1+in spleen, MLN, and peripheral blood. We speculated that this difference is caused solely by the lymphopenia gene. Since in our study we used congenic lymphopenic rats, which have only the short lyp region from the BB rat, and there is no possibility of interference of other genes from the BB rat we conclude that the lyp mutation does cause an increase in the percentages of double negative CD4\u2212CD8\u2212and a reduction of double positive CD4+CD8+T cells in the thymus.",

The F344.lyp/lyp rats represent a perfect tool to study lymphopenia independent of autoimmune abnormalities and should be useful to determine whether the Ian5 gene is a key factor in T-cell development. If the mechanisms of Ian5-associated T cell development can be clarified in this rat, it should be possible to demonstrate whether (as we expect) similar mechanisms are applicable to human T-cell development. Finally the understanding of the genomic organization of the Ian gene family and the possible interaction between these genes during T cell differentiation may help to elucidate the possible role of T cells in human type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune disorders.",
