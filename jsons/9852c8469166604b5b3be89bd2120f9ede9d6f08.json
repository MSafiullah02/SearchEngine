Data Sources and Study Selection: A MEDLINE search was performed for key words related to hepatic diseases, including acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and etiologic causes. Abstracts were reviewed, and articles discussing use of laboratory tests selected for review. Additional articles were selected from the references. Guideline Preparation and Review: Drafts of the guidelines were posted on the Internet, presented at the AACC Annual Meeting in 1999, and reviewed by experts. Areas requiring further amplification or literature review were identified for further analysis. Specific recommendations were made based on analysis of pub-lished data and evaluated for strength of evidence and clinical impact. Recommendations: Although many specific recommendations are made in the guidelines, only some summary recommendations are listed here. In acute hepatic injury, prothrombin time and, to a lesser extent, total bilirubin are the best indicators of severity of disease. Although ALT is useful for detecting acute and chronic hepatic injury, it is not related to severity of acute hepatic injury and only weakly related to severity of chronic hepatic injury.

An estimated 80% of individuals with acute viral hepatitis are never diagnosed clinically, although some may be detected by increased aminotransferases in the face of nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. AST and ALT activities are seldom \u03fe10 times the upper reference limit in liver diseases other than acute hepatic injury. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP; EC 3.1.3.1) is more than three times the upper reference limit in \u03fd10% of cases of acute hepatic injury (2, 3 ) . With the decreasing incidence of acute viral hepatitis, other liver diseases are more commonly encountered as causes of increased AST or ALT activities; as many as 25% of those with AST \u03fe10 times the reference limit may have obstruction as a cause (4 ) . Approximately 1-2% of patients with bile duct obstruction have transient increases in AST and/or ALT activities of \u03fe2000 U/L (5, 6 ) ; aminotransferase activities usually fall to within reference limits by 10 days even if obstruction persists (2, 4, 5 ) . The distribution of direct bilirubin as a percentage of total bilirubin is similar in acute hepatic injury and obstructive jaundice (7 ) . In patients with jaundice, only 16% of those with acute hepatic injury have direct bilirubin \u03fd50% of total bilirubin; values below this suggest another cause for jaundice, such as hemolysis (7 ) . The best discriminant values for recognizing acute hepatic injury appear to be 200 U/L for AST (sensitivity, 91%; specificity, 95%) and 300 U/L for ALT (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 94%) (3 ) . AST is \u03fe10 times the upper reference limit in slightly over one-half of patients at the time of presentation (3 ) . In uncomplicated alcoholic hepatitis, AST and ALT values are almost never \u03fe10 times the upper reference limit, the AST/ALT ratio is \u03fe2 in 80% of cases, and increased ALP is present in 20% of cases (8 -12 ) . Jaundice occurs in 60 -70% of cases of alcoholic hepatitis (9, 10 ) . The frequency of jaundice in patients with acute viral hepatitis differs both by age and etiologic agent. Jaundice is rare in children with viral hepatitis, and when it is present is less severe than in adults. In one study, only 1% of children with acute hepatitis had peak bilirubin \u03fe171 mol/L (10 mg/dL), whereas 27% of adults did (13 ) . In adults, jaundice develops in 70% of cases of acute hepatitis A (14 ) , 33-50% of cases of acute hepatitis B (15, 16 ) , and 20 -33% of cases of acute hepatitis C (17, 18 ) . In children, there is a direct correlation between age and peak serum bilirubin; an increase of 10 years in age is associated with an average increase of 85 mol/L (5 mg/dL) in bilirubin.

In 147 patients with cirrhosis, none of the 30 patients with HCC had AFP \u03fe105 g/L at the time of diagnosis and 60% had AFP \u03fd20 g/L; however, the frequency of HCC in patients with AFP \u03fd50 g/L was 17% compared with 42% in those with higher AFP (192 ) . In another study of 260 patients with cirrhosis, HCC developed in 26% of patients with initial AFP \u03fd20 g/L, but 46% in those with higher concentrations. Moreover, those with even transient increases above 100 g/L had a significantly higher risk of HCC than those whose AFP was consistently \u03fd20 g/L (193 ) . A decision analysis on published reports of screening for HCC in Western patients with compensated cirrhosis concluded that, for patients with a likelihood of survival of 85% at 5 years, screening would likely add 3-9 months to average life expectancy at a cost of $26 000 to $55 000 per year of life gained, figures that compare favorably to those for colon cancer and breast cancer screening (194 ) .

Although des-\u2425-carboxy prothrombin appears less sensitive (50 -70%) than AFP, it is more specific. There is poor correlation between AFP and des-\u2425-carboxy prothrombin, and some tumors are detected only by des-\u2425-carboxy prothrombin (199 -203 ) . Vitamin K deficiency can also cause substantial increases; repeating testing after administration of vitamin K improves specificity (199, 200, 204, 205 ) .
