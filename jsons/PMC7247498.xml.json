The most relevant finding in the present study was the demonstration that the sudden olfactory dysfunction associated with COVID-19 had a lower rate of full recovery and a longer duration than in negative-COVID-19 patients. Only half of the positive-COVID-19 patients fully recovered olfaction, compared to 70.3% of the negative-COVID-19 ones (p\n = 0.05). Considering only those who fully recovered the olfaction, it took positive-COVID-19 patients 15 days (median) to fully recover their sense of smell, 5 days longer than negative-COVID-19 ones (p\n = 0.0006). The second relevant point is that the full recovery from sudden hyposmia in positive-COVID-19 patients occurred more frequently than that from sudden anosmia (p\n = 0.04).",

However, it is interesting to mention that population studies tend to show a higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in men.6 This skewed distribution of loss of smell in COVID-19 may be due to the decreased capacity of men to perceive the olfactory dysfunction, or even women's greater concern for their health, or an actual selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 for the female gender.",

However, full recovery from sudden olfactory dysfunction was reported by only 11.5% of the patients, and only 5.3% of patients in the study were tested for COVID-19, making it difficult to extrapolate the data.14 Our global data also showed high rates of some reported degree of olfactory recovery (86.8%) over a 31-day follow-up period (median), but this does not mean full recovery from sudden olfactory dysfunction, that is, return to the levels before the sudden loss of smell, which is desired by patients and doctors. Considering that 183 patients (72.3%) were tested for COVID-19, it was possible to compare the result of sudden loss of smell between positive- and negative-COVID-19 patients. Positive-COVID-19 patients had a lower full recovery rate from sudden olfactory dysfunction than negative-COVID-19 ones (52.6% vs. 70.3%; p\n = 0.05*). Moreover, positive-COVID-19 patients who managed to attain full recovery took 5 days longer than negative ones (median 15 days vs. 10 days; p\n = 0.0006*). Therefore, our data showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused a type of sudden olfactory dysfunction that was more difficult to resolve than sudden anosmia/hyposmia in negative-COVID-19 patients (which may possibly represent other post-viral olfaction losses, since in the present sample, only 13.2% of negative-COVID-19 patients did not have other associated infection symptoms). There are no data on the recovery of post-viral sudden olfactory dysfunction in the acute phase; therefore, the present study may bring new data in this sense as well. The present study also showed that sudden hyposmia in the positive-COVID-19 patients had a better evolution than those with sudden anosmia, also an unprecedented finding in the literature. Testing for COVID-19 is not the norm in outpatients in most countries, so much so that previous studies of sudden olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 with questionnaires showed low rates of tested patients included in the studies, ranging from 3.3% to 5.3%.11, 14\n",
