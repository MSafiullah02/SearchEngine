Survival for lung transplant recipients continues to lag behind that of other solid organ transplant recipients, with a median survival (\u201chalf-life\u201d) of 5.5 years.1 Graft failure and non-cytomegalovirus (non-CMV) infection remain the major reported causes of postoperative mortality in the first year after transplantation. After the first year, the most common identifiable causes for mortality are bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and non-CMV infection. Immunosuppression contributes significantly to posttransplant infections in all recipients; however, lung transplant recipients are generally more intensively immunosuppressed than other solid organ recipients and have more frequent and more severe infectious complications. In addition, factors such as preoperative microorganism colonization, transmission of infectious agents from the donor organs, blunted cough mechanism due to denervation, impaired mucociliary clearance, poor lymphatic drainage, ischemic large airways in the immediate postoperative period, and constant exposure to the environment uniquely place lung transplant recipients at higher risk for infections than other organ recipients.2\n",

Burkholderia cenocepacia (genomovar III) and Burkholderia multivorans (genomovar II) account for the majority of infections.14\nB cenocepacia is associated with a much higher risk of posttransplant mortality, including a 6-fold higher risk of death at 1 year compared with patients infected with BCC organisms other than B cenocepacia and an 8-fold higher risk of death at 1 year compared with patients not infected with any BCC organism.15 In that series, BCC infection with organisms other than B cenocepacia did not increase the risk of death after transplantation in comparison with patients not infected with BCC. B cenocepacia can cause pneumonia, locally invasive disease with empyema, and disseminated infection. Although not a member of the BCC, Burkholderia gladioli has also been associated with an increased mortality.16 Transplant centers have to consider the specific species of Burkholderia and the risk of B cenocepacia infection when evaluating patients with CF infected with these organisms.",

In contrast, controversy exists on the optimal approach for recipients at medium risk (D\u2212/R+ or D+/R+) for CMV disease. One strategy involves universal prophylaxis for all at-risk patients. The second strategy is based on monitoring and preemptive therapy at the time of identification of active viral replication, ideally before symptomatic infection. Using this strategy, medium-risk patients are monitored frequently (once to twice weekly), screening either for viral pp65 antigenemia or with a plasma polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CMV. Assays vary, and different virology laboratory tests have different thresholds of positivity. At present, fewer centers rely on testing for pp65 antigenemia because the PCR assay has become more widely available and is less prone to technical errors.

There is also a small risk of ganciclovir resistance in patients on prophylaxis, especially if treatment is periodically interrupted. In addition, a limitation of prophylaxis for a given time course is shifting the timeline of CMV disease to a later time point after transplantation. CMV-specific immunoglobulin (Cytogam) is used at few centers as part of the prophylactic regimen for high-risk patients.19 No randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the superiority of universal prophylaxis over a preemptive strategy. However, one large multicenter trial demonstrated that in at-risk patients, 12 months of prophylaxis with valganciclovir was superior to 3 months after 13 months of follow-up with respect to CMV infection, with no change in acute rejection, CMV UL97 ganciclovir resistance mutations, or laboratory abnormalities.20\n",

            "text": "The term CMV infection applies to any situation in which viral replication is identified. CMV disease indicates CMV infection with symptoms, including mononucleosis-like syndrome with fever, malaise, and fatigue, or organ-specific invasion involving the lung (Fig. 1\n), liver, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, or retina.21 As discussed earlier, there is no universal standard of the viral load cutoff that represents a positive blood PCR result. However, if symptoms are present, the general consensus is to initiate treatment of CMV infection. Standard therapy includes intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg twice daily, or oral valganciclovir, 900 mg twice daily, with dose adjustments for renal function and leukocyte count. Oral valganciclovir has been shown to be noninferior to intravenous ganciclovir in a mixed population of transplant recipients and can be considered as initial therapy, especially in patients with subclinical CMV infection and mild disease.22, 23 Antiviral therapy is generally continued for at least 1 week after viral replication is no longer detectable. CMV-specific immunoglobulin can be used as add-on therapy in severe cases or in patients not responding to initial therapy, especially in seronegative recipients. In patients not responding to conventional therapy, resistance to ganciclovir must be evaluated. The UL 97 gene encodes a protein kinase involved in the phosphorylation and activation of ganciclovir, and mutations within this gene are the most common mechanisms of ganciclovir resistance. Mutations within the UL54 region, which encodes for CMV DNA polymerase, also confer ganciclovir resistance and are more likely to result in resistance to cidofovir and foscarnet. Many patients with UL 97 mutations, and some with UL54 mutations, respond to therapy with cidofovir or foscarnet; however, drug toxicity is the major obstacle to treatment.",

At our center, patients with a positive result for nasopharyngeal viral swab for RSV are treated with 3 days of inhaled ribavirin therapy. Intravenous ribavirin therapy is limited by drug toxicity, especially hemolytic anemia. Other treatment modalities, including palivizumab, an immunomodulating RSV-specific monoclonal antibody; intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG); and RSV-IVIG (no longer commercially available), have been evaluated in children and in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. These agents seem to decrease viral loads in animal studies and have shown trends toward efficacy in clinical trials in the stem cell transplant population; however, few data exist in lung transplant recipients.26\n",

In addition, recent studies suggest that administering rituximab earlier in the course of PTLD improves the response and duration of remission.36, 37 If reducing immunosuppression and administration of rituximab does not induce remission of PTLD, systemic chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) is usually administered.

There is emerging data that echinocandins, (caspofungin [Cancidas], micafungin [Mycamine], and anidulafungin [Eraxis]), alone or in combination with voriconazole may be an effective first-line treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis, with significantly less toxicity.47, 48 Voriconazole is generally preferred over itraconazole, given the more predicable bioavailability of voriconazole over itraconazole. Posaconazole (Noxafil) also has activity against Aspergillus species, but there is not as much experience with this agent, and it is not available in an intravenous formulation. In addition, azoles have a potent interaction with calcineurin inhibitors, and the cyclosporine (Neoral) or tacrolimus (Prograf) doses need to be significantly reduced when itraconazole or voriconazole are inititated.41\n",

Several recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of echinocandins in invasive candidiasis and should be considered as a first-line treatment pending identification and speciation of the Candida species in culture.49, 50, 51 Amphotericin B is effective for invasive candidiasis; however, given its toxicity and the effectiveness of safer echinocandins and azoles, it should be reserved for treatment failures or patients who are intolerant of echinocandins and are infected by organisms that are resistant to azole agents.",
