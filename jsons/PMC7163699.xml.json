The most polymorphic regions are found inside the MHCI and MHCII loci, which contain genes encoding for the MHC class I and II Ag\u2010presenting molecules. The MHCII locus also contains a number of mostly non\u2010polymorphic genes encoding proteins involved in the processing, editing and transportation of Ags for presentation on MHC molecules 11, 12, 13, 14.",

To study the mechanisms underlying autoimmunity, animal models have been established in which self\u2010tolerance is broken by an active immunization with an Ag. In mice and rats, immunization with tissue\u2010specific Ags or even ubiquitously expressed proteins induces organ\u2010specific autoimmunity 25, 26, 27, 28. Such induced type of autoimmunity is often dependent on T cells recognizing a specific peptide\u2010MHCII complex; for example, in collagen\u2010induced arthritis (CIA), a peptide derived from type II collagen presented by H2\u2010Aq is crucial for the development of disease 29, 30, 31, 32. However, the ensuing autoimmunity in such models is not necessarily T\u2010cell\u2010driven 29, 33, 34, 35 or induced by an autologous T\u2010cell epitope: mice immunized with rat, bovine or chicken CII, for example, respond strongly to stimulation with the heterologous CII but relatively weakly to autologous mouse CII 36, 37.",

Pristane is a saturated, naturally occurring, hydrocarbon that is used for ascites production and the induction of lupus in mice 39, 40, 41. In DA rats, a single intradermal injection of pristane induces a chronic relapsing polyarthritis that can remain active for at least 200 days 18. The disease onset is early, highly synchronized between animals, and accompanied by elevated levels of IL\u20106, rheumatoid factor, and a strong acute phase response 15, 18, 42, 43. The induction of arthritis does not appear to be dependent on B cells or the production of antibodies, since adoptive transfer of CD4 T cells from rats injected with pristane induces a disease in na\u00efve rats that closely mimics the manifestations in PIA 14, 18, 23, 44.",

We have previously shown that Tcs2\u2010congenic strains, that is, DA.1HR61, DA.1UR10, and DA.1FR9, differ in their susceptibility to PIA due to coding polymorphisms in the RT1\u2010B locus 15.

DA.1FR9, by contrast, develops a more severe form of arthritis with an early onset. In the present study, we also used two new strains, DA.1HR10 and DA.1FR61, which refine the congenic intervals in DA.1HR61 and DA.1FR9, respectively (for a physical map over all strains, see Tuncel at al. 12). The development of PIA in DA.1HR10 and DA.1FR61 was comparable to the arthritis development in the respective parental strains (Fig. 1B and C; see also Supporting Information Fig. 1 for a comparison of PIA in DA.1HR10 versus DA.1HR61 and DA.1FR61 versus DA.1FR9).",

In DA rats, donor T cells required a minimum of 5 days of priming in vivo to transfer arthritis and 8 days to become fully arthritogenic (Fig. 1D). Similarly, in DA.1FR61, T cells from eight out of nine donors (89%) transferred arthritis after 5 days of priming in vivo. In contrast, this 5\u2010day interval was only sufficient to prime T cells in 2/8 DA.1HR10 donors (25%, p<0.002 versus DA) and 6/10 DA.1UR10 (60%, p<0.2 versus DA) donors to transfer arthritis (Fig. 1E).",

However, these events do not necessary need to unfold in the joints.

First, pristane, being a hydrocarbon, cannot bind to MHCII molecules and it is unlikely that pristane operates directly on T cells or is presented by CD1 9. Instead, functional and genetic data have suggested that stimulation of innate signals and pattern\u2010recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll\u2010like receptors and C\u2010type lectin receptors, are important for the triggering of an adaptive response in PIA 11, 13, 14. Although it has never formally been excluded that pristane cannot be presented by CD1, blocking of MHCII\u2010TCR interactions during T\u2010cell priming (2\u20134 days post pristane) is sufficient to ameliorate PIA 15. Second, activation of skin\u2010resident dendritic cells appears to be important for the priming of autoreactive T cells in PIA 18. Third, injections of 14C\u2010labelled hexadecane have shown that mineral oils accumulate within the dLNs with no detectable oil being found in the joints themselves 20, suggesting that the primary site of T\u2010cell activation is within the lymphoid organs. Our data suggest that the primary sites of T\u2010cell activation are LNs draining the injection site as T cells at these locations could transfer arthritis as early as 5 days after pristane administration.

Several studies have shown that ligation of OX40 on Treg cells dampens their regulatory activity 29, 34, and, in the presence of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u20104, favors expansion of T effector cells over Treg cells 36. This could explain the expansion of T effector cells we observed in DA and DA.1FR61 after pristane administration, where the local cytokine milieu, being high in IFN\u2010\u03b3, would favor T effector over Treg cell proliferation. Moreover, the high expression of OX40 on Treg cells in DA and DA.1FR61 could be associated with a poor immune regulatory function in these strains, which could amplify an ongoing expansion of autoreactive T cells even further. Consistent with this notion, also CD8 T cells, which are not restricted by MHCII or essential for the development of PIA 15, showed a greater proliferation in strains with arthritis promoting MHCII alleles. Such \u201cby\u2010stander\u201d proliferation could be associated with OX40 expression on Treg cells, since IL\u20102 and other growth factors could become more available in the absence of sufficient Treg suppression. Further, this could mean that Treg cells in DA.1HR10, which consisted of a larger proportion of OX40 negative cells, are better suppressor cells than Treg cells in DA and DA.1FR61. However, OX40 deficiency in Treg cells has also been associated with a lack of immune suppression, as shown for T\u2010cell\u2010induced colitis 39.

Recently, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was shown to induce expansion of Th1 cells and accelerate the onset of CIA in mice 61. Interestingly, pristane has been shown to be a potent inducer of NETs 62, suggesting that NETs could serve as an inducer of Th1 immunity in PIA. Th1 mediated immunity may also be relevant in early RA; studies have demonstrated that the preclinical phase of RA is dominated by Th1\u2010associated cytokines and chemokines (IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u201012, and CXCL10) 63, 64. Moreover, lymph node biopsies taken from individuals with an increased RA\u2010risk (that is, IgM\u2010RF and/or ACPA positive individuals with arthralgia but without any evidence of arthritis) and from patients with early RA showed elevated levels of T cells with a Th1 profile (CXCR3+ CCR6\u2212 CCR4\u2212) as compared to healthy controls, whereas no such differences were found for T cells with a Th17 or Th2 profile 65. In established RA, however, the presence of Th1 cells seems to be associated with disease protection rather than exacerbation. Likewise, in the PGIA model, IFN\u2010\u03b3 deficient mice eventually succumb to severe arthritis, probably as a result of increasing IL\u201017 levels 59. In PIA, DA.1HR10 rats develop the same severe chronic arthritis as non\u2010congenic DA rats 15, which is consistent with the finding here that the onset of disease marks the transition from an IFN\u2010\u03b3 to an IL\u201017 dependent disease. Whether Th17 cells are the primary source of IL\u201017 in established PIA remains to be determined. Unpublished findings from our lab show that both IL\u201017 and T cells are important for the perpetuation of late\u2010stage chronic PIA, suggesting that Th17 cells may play a specific role in the transition to chronic disease (J.T., S.H., and R.H., unpublished results).

Disease protected and non\u2010protected strains (or different treatment groups) were housed together in cages from the time\u2010point of weaning or for at least 2 weeks before the start of the experiment. Arthritis development was monitored daily or every second day using a macroscopic scoring system of 1\u201360 points per rat as described previously 18. In brief, 1 point was given for each inflamed knuckle or toe and up to 5 points were given for an affected ankle (in total 15 points per paw). All scoring was performed blinded and by different investigators. Weight loss of pristane\u2010injected rats was included as an objective measure of the disease severity. Weight changes in figures are indicated as % of body weight at disease onset. All experiments were approved and performed in accordance with the guidelines from the Swedish National Board for Laboratory Animals and the European Community Council Directive (86/609/EEC).",
