After backward stepwise selection, the following factors were associated with greatest increased risk of critical disease: number of comorbidities, body mass index, respiratory rate, white blood cell count, % lymphocytes, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, high sensitivity troponin I, ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein. Of a total of 40 patients in the validation cohort (median age, 60 years [range, 27-88 years]; 55% [22/40] male), critical disease was present in 65% (26/40).

A simple web-based tool utilized at patient presentation may facilitate decision making by simplifying integration of numerous clinical variables. Our model has a high negative predictive value, which can increase physician confidence in determining which patients may be discharged safely at presentation. This is of particular utility in settings of high healthcare utilization, especially when physicians are treating higher than expected numbers of patients and/or working outside of their standard practice. Our model has high positive predictive value, highlighting those patients for whom admission and close clinical monitoring may be appropriate.",

Based on these results and prevalence of candidate predictor, the top thirteen covariates were chosen and used to create multivariable logistic regression model. For missing data, median imputation was performed based on underlying critical disease status. Each covariate was independently normalized to a scale of [0, 1] based on minimum and maximum values present in the dataset. The model was implemented using L2 regularization and optimized using the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) technique.
