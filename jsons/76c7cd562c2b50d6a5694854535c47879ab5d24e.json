There is an urgent need to find novel agents with greater selectivity. This review highlights recent advances in the research of 19-nor-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 analogues, paying special attention to their activities and structureactivity relationships. ",

Using a structural model of the human Atg5-Atg16 complex, a total of 30 Atg16-based peptides were designed and tested for their binding affinity to Atg5. A number of these peptides exhibited binding affinities in the low micromolar range. Furthermore, three Atg16 residues were identified as the key factors in Atg5 binding. ",

Dorsch 1261 -1265 Discovery of NVP-LEQ506, a Second-Generation Inhibitor of Smoothened First disclosure: Continued optimization provided a novel type of Smoothened (Smo) antagonist based on a pyridazine core. The compound, NVP-LEQ506, currently in phase I clinical trials, combines high intrinsic potency and good pharmacokinetic properties resulting in excellent efficacy in rodent tumor models of medulloblastoma. Activity against a Smo mutant conferring resistance observed in a previous clinical trial with a competitor compound suggests additional therapeutic potential. B. Rubio-Ruiz, J. Ramos-Torrecillas, F.
