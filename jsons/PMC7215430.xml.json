To ensure the protection of the healthcare workers (HCWs) treating these patients, personal protective equipment (PPE) is imperative. However, the widespread shortage of PPE is well known, which requires a degree of ingenuity to tap into other meaningful resources [2] and to close the gap between the need for and the availability of PPE. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has itself considered the use of nonmedical devices in crisis situations [3].",

Furthermore, the potential for people infected with SARS-CoV-2 to transmit the virus while asymptomatic [5,6], the mode of transmission, and the aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 require a specific focus on preventive measures [7], which may vary depending on the activities that HCWs perform [8].",

Face shields in combination with additional PPE (goggles and mouth/nose mask) have been shown to reduce the risk of inhalational exposure, especially when performing activities with aerosol formation [9,11]. HCWs, particularly those prone to contact with potentially infected aerosols, are at high risk of exposure to an increased viral load and should be provided with the appropriate PPE to prevent infection and avoid possible nosocomial spreading routes [12]. Face shields are PPE devices used by many workers (e.g., medical, dental, and veterinary personnel) for protection of the facial area from splashes, sprays, or the spatter of body fluids. However, face shields should be used with other protective equipment and, as such, are classified as adjunctive PPEs [9]. Recommendations on face shield use differ depending on the setting but the essential use of PPEs in the population during a pandemic has led the WHO to appeal for an increase in their production [13]. Supplementary PPEs are recommended for high-risk HCWs in particular, including goggles for eye protection and face shields to avoid contamination of the facial area. Due to their proximity to patients and subsequent potential exposure to infected airborne particles or aerosols [14,15], the presence of oral fluids, and the use of sharp instruments, HCWs are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [16].",

Face shields are considered Class I medical devices, exempt from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pre-Market Notification (Form 510 [K]) [9], which can be manufactured using materials that have been classified harmless when in contact with skin or food. Therefore, to provide HCWs with sufficient PPEs to increase facial protection, face shields could be 3-D printed. 3-D printers are in widespread use for professional and private purposes. Despite not being as fast as injection molding processes, this method of production allows the at-home, on-demand manufacture of face shields by a broad spectrum of users. This study evaluates the utilization of 3-D printers, which are otherwise used for dental purposes, to produce face shields using open-source design data and investigates their clinical suitability.",

By contrast, stereolithography (SLA) printers require uncured resin to be removed from the finished print using cleaning or washing procedures prior to additional light-curing [18,19]. While both printing techniques require support structures in non-supported areas, FDM-based techniques will generally require fewer support structures. Thus, this process further decreases the time needed for post-processing. Moreover, some design features such as the clamping slot of the Easy 3D Face Shield or the shield curvature aid of the RC2 can result in failures when using SLA-techniques due to the non-removable support structures in non-accessible gaps or fissures.",

The Prusa i3 MKS3 sample used in the present study features a print bed with a width of 210 mm, a length of 210 mm, and a maximum printing height of 250 mm. The sample is, therefore, suitable for printing all of the face shields evaluated. Other printers, e.g., Form 3 (Formlabs, Somerville, Massachusetts, USA) do not offer the printing volume needed. In order to print the RC2 design, the dataset would have to be scaled to 95% and/or the printing direction changed to fit onto the printing platform. Changing the size may result in an improved or diminished fit of the face shield. Moreover, the benefit of a support-structure free design is no longer present when longer printing times are needed due to having to change the printing direction.",

In addition, ABS has to be printed at higher temperatures (240\u2013250 \u00b0C) compared to polylactide (PLA, 180\u2013220 \u00b0C) and is, therefore, more susceptible to shrinkage during cooling. As a consequence, ABS is considered to be more prone to failures during the printing process. Polyethylene terephthalate (PETG) combines both the high fracture strength of ABS and the reduced susceptibility to failure of PLA. However, again, it lacks biodegradability. The material used in the present study is based on lignin (GreenTEC PRO) and combines the previously mentioned attributes [20]. Visors can be manufactured from several types of materials that include polycarbonate, propionate, acetate, poly(vinylchloride), and PETG [9]. Since PLA and PETG are known to show volume change during sterilization processes [21], one-time use of the visor is recommended, whereas a study showed that sterilized 3-D printed surgical splints using filaments based on lignin (Green-TEC Pro) remained dimensionally stable [22]. The sterilization of the frame might be possible, but was not tested in this study. Therefore, a recommendation regarding sterializability cannot be made.

Stacking frames may be an easy method for overnight printing in a private, non-industrial setting.
