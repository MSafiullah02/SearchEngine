            "text": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is essential for definitive categorization of arrhythmias in cattle. Vector analysis of ECG tracings to determine cardiac chamber enlargements and other pathology seldom is used in cattle because ventricular myocardial depolarization tends to be rapid and diffuse rather than organized, as in some other species. ECG is also indicated when cattle have variation in heart sound intensity, require monitoring for anesthesia or treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, or show signs of heart failure. Cardiac ultrasonography, however, has largely superseded the ECG as a diagnostic tool in determining chamber enlargement and other cardiac pathology.",

The resultant ECG recorded through the base-apex lead system has a positive P wave with a single peak, a QRS complex with an initial positive deflection followed by a large negative deflection, and a variable (positive or negative) T wave (Fig. 3.5\n).",

            "text": "Bovine cardiac diseases are most commonly diagnosed when the condition is already advanced and production outcomes have already been affected (decreased milk production, poor reproductive performance, diminished appetite, weight loss or altered growth). The diagnosis of heart disease may be clinically difficult until overt signs of heart failure occur (e.g., peripheral edema, distended jugular veins, or true jugular pulse). However, some cardiac diseases such as endocarditis and VSD may be less commonly associated with clinical signs of heart failure. Routine cardiac auscultation also has its limitations, especially under noisy field conditions or in adults with high body condition score. For these reasons, ancillary tests may be extremely valuable in reaching the definitive diagnosis and to facilitate appropriate case management. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is becoming more available and more readily accessible on farms because of improvements in ultrasound quality, affordability, and portability. This imaging technique has the potential to help practitioners reach a definitive diagnosis antemortem, therefore improving case management. Importantly, it can help avoid unnecessary treatments if the prognosis is hopeless as well as differentiate life-threatening conditions (pericarditis secondary to hardware disease) from more benign ones (idiopathic hemorrhagic pericarditis). By contrast with other veterinary species (small animals, horses) in which echocardiographic examination now entails precise calculations of various functional indices or dimensions and can require extensive postgraduate training and expensive equipment and software, bovine echocardiography does not. A great deal of information can be obtained when one knows which views are needed and how to get them. Several of the common cardiac conditions of dairy calves and adult cattle have characteristic ultrasonographic features, and when a veterinarian has become somewhat familiar with the likely image findings for each, a definitive diagnosis can often be reached. Practically speaking, a complete echocardiographic examination can be performed on the farm in about 15 to 20 minutes.",

            "text": "Transthoracic echocardiography is usually best performed with the individual standing and restrained by a halter. An assistant may also be useful depending on the patient\u2019s demeanor to keep the thoracic limb forward during the examination to improve access to the cardiac window on the side in question. The author (SB) generally prefers to put his own leg medial to the forelimb in order to perform a gentle abduction of the cow\u2019s limb; this often helps in obtaining better quality images (Fig. 3.6\n). TTE is classically performed using \u201ccardiac windows\u201d composed of the ventral third to fifth ICSs on both the right and left sides of the thorax. Ideally, the area is clipped, and ultrasonographic coupling gel is applied. Depending on the context of the examination, a faster technique may be achieved by applying 70% isopropyl alcohol directly to the unclipped skin surface without coupling gel. The author has used this technique increasingly to good effect in recent years. It has the advantage of avoiding unnecessary clipping if there is a high likelihood of sale or culling in the near future and is also more popular with owners of individually valuable cattle during show season! Hair length and body condition (chest wall thickness) can both interfere with the diagnostic quality of images when only alcohol is used. A low-frequency probe (\u22643.5 MHz) with good penetration (examination depth >20 cm) is required for adult cows. For calves, a 5 MHz probe is usually adequate because of the smaller size of the thorax. The major limiting factor in performing TTE is the size and shape of the probe compared with the width and accessibility of the relevant intercostal spaces. Many cattle, even those without painful chest walls, resent examination under the elbow and into the axillae, tending to respond by powerful, counterproductive forelimb adduction as the examiner moves the probe forward. Probe rotation, necessary to obtain the standard views, is often challenging, especially in the more cranial ICSs. The phased-array probes (specifically used for echocardiography and therefore more expensive) are optimal; larger sector probes also work quite well but may have limitations for some of the views described in the following section.",

This view allows observation of the two ventricles and atria as well as the AV valves (Fig. 3.7\n). A slight clockwise rotation of the transducer allows observation of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) view. This view is of particular value when aortic problems are suspected and for visualization of the membranous part of the interventricular septum (IVS) (Fig. 3.8\n) which may be absent or incomplete in cases of VSD.",

            "text": "Although rarely analyzed in ambulatory practice, there have been a number of publications in recent years on the use of cardiac biomarkers for the assessment of myocardial injury in the hospital setting. Borrowing from human cardiology in which cardiac troponins have become an essential part of point-of-care assessment in the management of chest pain and the diagnostic and prognostic data set for myocardial ischemia patients, it is appealing to think that there might be similar value to the measurement of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in cattle with physical examination or ancillary diagnostic findings suggestive of acute cardiac disease. The obvious difference in prevalence of acute myocardial ischemia between cattle and humans means that the number one indication for cTnI measurement in human patients will never be duplicated in cattle. However, bovine cTnI has been examined in association with congenital heart defects in calves, experimental monensin toxicosis, and a variety of primary cardiac conditions such as endocarditis and pericarditis, as well as in dairy cattle with common, noncardiac production diseases. In each of these published studies, commercial human immunoassays were used, and although different manufacturers\u2019 kits have been used in different studies, there is a great deal of structural homology between cTnI among mammalian species, suggesting that these assays would very likely accurately detect the bovine protein. Consequently, a normal reference range of 0 to 0.05 ng/mL has been suggested in healthy, lactating dairy cattle when a widely available, handheld point-of-care analyzer was used. Other studies have suggested an upper cutoff point of 0.08 ng/mL when a different, laboratory-based immunoassay was used. Cattle with severe, acute myocardial injury, such as that caused by ionophore toxicosis, show marked increases in cTnI to greater than 1 ng/mL over a 1- to 6-day interval after a single, massive overdose. This quantitative increase is paralleled by echocardiographic, electrocardiographic, and histopathologic evidence of marked myocardial necrosis and cardiac dysfunction. Other studies looking at congenital cardiac defects and acquired cardiac conditions of adulthood (pericarditis and endocarditis) have also demonstrated elevations above normal controls, but there is no useful prognostic information in cattle at this point that can be extrapolated from these data. Other, noncardiac primary intrathoracic diseases, such as pneumonia, and noncardiac intrathoracic abscessation, can also be associated with occasional spikes in measured cTnI. In conclusion, although one can identify acute bovine myocardial injury with the use of cTnI measurement, we are currently uncertain of the kinetics of release and half-life of the released protein and how to prognostically interpret single time point values. The half-life of cTnI is very short in other species eg., one hour in the horse.",

Specific cardiac signs are variable and include arrhythmias, persistent tachycardia, murmurs, exercise intolerance, cyanosis, dyspnea, congestive heart failure signs, and acute death. Signs may be subtle or dramatic, depending on the magnitude and location of myocardial damage. Sudden death can occur spontaneously, after exercise or even following mere restraint. Other signs of white muscle disease such as stiffness, difficulty in prehension or swallowing, inhalation pneumonia, recumbency, and myoglobinuria may or may not be present. Dyspnea may be directly related to the cardiac lesions or may be caused by Zenker\u2019s degeneration in the diaphragm or intercostal muscles.

Glucose and bicarbonate help transport K+ back into cells, and the glucose also treats or prevents potential hypoglycemia.

Sometimes ocular, tail, and cardiac defects all are present in the same calf, but it is more common to find either tail or ocular pathology plus VSD. Depending on the size of the VSD, affected calves have a variable life span. Prognosis for most is hopeless because of eventual respiratory difficulty and stunting.

Muffling and splashing sounds are possible if a pericardial transudate or exudate is present. The most common site of tumor involvement is the right atrium, but nodular or infiltrative tumors can be found anywhere in the myocardium, pericardium, or epicardium (Fig. 3.19, Fig. 3.20, Fig. 3.21\n). The color and consistency of the tumors may vary. Mediastinal lymph nodes also are commonly involved. Cattle with signs of heart disease should be thoroughly examined for other lesions consistent with lymphosarcoma. When multiple lesions exist, the diagnosis is easy. However, cattle examined because of vague signs such as hypophagia and decreased milk production that are found to have tachycardia or other cardiac abnormalities can present diagnostic challenges. Although ECGs and thoracic radiographs have seldom helped make a definitive diagnosis, echocardiography may be very helpful to image nodular or large masses of lymphosarcoma. Common echocardiographic findings include varying degrees of pericardial effusion that usually cannot be accurately distinguished from other causes of pericardial effusion by appearance alone (e.g., needs to be confirmed by pericardiocentesis) or the presence of a mass effect in the right atrial wall or atrial wall thickening (Fig. 3.22\n). In the case of a mass in the right atrial wall, the other important differential diagnosis would be mural endocarditis, although this is very uncommon. Thoracocentesis and pericardiocentesis to obtain fluid for cytologic evaluation are the most helpful ancillary aids when cardiac lymphosarcoma is suspected (Fig. 3.23\n). A complete blood count (CBC) and assessment of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) antibody status are indicated, but a positive BLV agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test does not ensure an absolute diagnosis because most positive cattle never develop tumors (see the section on lymphosarcoma in Chapter 16). Therefore, simply assuming a cow with a positive BLV test and heart abnormality detected on physical examination has lymphosarcoma may be an incorrect assumption. A double line-positive BLV-AGID may add further weight to the suspected diagnosis, as would the finding of a persistent lymphocytosis (PL) in a CBC. Clinical identification of masses in other locations or cytology from thoracocentesis or pericardiocentesis provides the best means of definitive diagnosis. If both pleural and pericardial effusions can be identified, then pericardiocentesis will often provide a greater chance of identifying exfoliated neoplastic cells in cases of cardiac lymphosarcoma because pleural fluid accumulation may just reflect a transudate associated with poor cardiac function.",

Septicemic calves, calves suspected of having\nH. somni infection, and calves with chronic infections should be suspected of having septic myocarditis if an arrhythmia or other signs of abnormal cardiac function develop during their illness. White muscle disease, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia should also be considered in the differential. Septicemic calves have a guarded prognosis, and septic myocarditis worsens it. Foci of septic myocarditis in adult cattle with chronic, active infection or abscesses associated with mastitis, localized peritonitis, foot lesions, or chronic pneumonia are more commonly identified by pathologists than clinicians. Although tachycardia is likely to be present, this finding often is assumed to result from the primary illness rather than from myocarditis. As with calves, adult cattle with septic myocarditis may have paroxysmal cardiac arrhythmias that alert the clinician to the diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis has been difficult in the living patient, but increased concentrations of troponin I may be used to help diagnose myocardial disease. An ECG showing atrial or ventricular premature depolarizations in a calf or cow with evidence of sepsis or a walled-off infection can be used to lend credence to the diagnosis. Although bovine echocardiography does not have the same diagnostic utility for myocardial disease as it does for endocardial and pericardial conditions, it can still be of some value, particularly in cases of cardiomyopathy or myocardial mass lesions such as lymphosarcoma and myocardial abscesses. In all cases of myocardial injury, whether it is toxic (ionophore, gossypol, other toxic plants), nutritional (white muscle disease) or inflammatory (H. somni), disease progression will ultimately be accompanied by cardiac dilation and resultant nonspecific echocardiographic changes if the animal survives the acute injury. Presumably, the right ventricular hypertrophy that accompanies high-altitude pulmonary hypertension in brisket disease of cattle maintained at elevation in the western United States might also be associated with identifiable echocardiographic abnormalities.",

Septicemic spread of infectious organisms, thrombi, or mediators of inflammation may be involved in the pathophysiology of myocardial injury that occurs in septic cattle. Although relatively uncommon, development of persistent tachycardia with or without an arrhythmia in a patient with infectious disease may suggest myocarditis. Tachycardia is so nonspecific that most veterinarians attribute the tachycardia to the primary disease rather than secondary myocarditis. Only when the myocardial damage causes signs of heart failure does a diagnosis of myocarditis become easier. Acute death is possible. Arrhythmia, if present, must be assessed using ECG alongside blood electrolytes and acid\u2013base status to rule out atrial fibrillation associated with metabolic abnormalities. Adult dairy cattle are most at risk for myocarditis with acute septic diseases such as severe mastitis, metritis, pneumonia, and infection caused by H. somni. Occasional cases also occur secondary to chronic localized infections such as digital abscesses that predispose to bacteremia. Depending on the size and location of the myocardial lesion, clinical signs range from subclinical to overt heart failure. ECG evidence of ventricular arrhythmias would suggest myocardial damage, but supraventricular arrhythmias are possible as well. Unfortunately, definitive antemortem diagnosis is impossible without advanced echocardiographic or invasive cardiac techniques. Treatment must be directed at the primary disease. Minor myocardial lesions away from nodal and conduction tissue may heal or fibrose asymptomatically, whereas large or multifocal lesions may lead to heart failure, persistent tachyarrhythmia, or sudden death. Although rarer than septic myocardial injury it is also possible to see myocarditis secondary to severe anemia in which an ischemic injury caused by insufficient oxygen delivery to cardiac myocytes has occurred. In this instance, it is also easy to attribute the tachycardia to the primary disease, but the observant clinician may pick up on this possibility when a tachyarrhythmia is auscultated or seen on ECG in an animal with peracute to acute hemorrhage.",

An appropriate interval between collections of multiple samples has been debated by clinicians for decades. Some clinicians culture only during a fever spike, some at 3- to 30-minute intervals, some at 6- to 8-hour intervals, and some once daily.

Definitive diagnosis based on two-dimensional echocardiography has proved to be one of the most impressive uses of ultrasonography since its more widespread use began about 10 years ago. Veterinarians trained in echocardiography now have a tool to confirm bacterial endocarditis in most patients. The echocardiographic examination should be performed mindful of the fact that endocarditis involves the valvular endocardium in more than 98% of reported cases; mural lesions being extremely rare. As pointed out in a systematic review of published cases by Buczinski et al. (2012), the tricuspid valve is the most commonly affected valve (49.5%) followed by the mitral (29.7%), the pulmonary (13.7%), and aortic (7.5%) valves; information that can be particularly useful in directing the examination when performing echocardiography in cattle with an auscultable murmur. The typical endocarditic lesion will be an irregular valvular thickening with heterogeneous content and a shaggy appearance. Depending on the clinical findings and the resultant, but not invariant, murmur (auscultated in \u224860% of cases), the best views should be selected to image the suspicious valve.

Unfortunately, there is significant variability in blood levels between treated cattle, which may limit its treatment potential. Rifampin is a unique antibiotic that gains access to intracellular organisms or walled-off infections by concentrating in macrophages. Rifampin always should be used in conjunction with another antibiotic because bacterial resistance may develop quickly when the drug is used alone. The dosage is 5 mg/kg orally, twice daily for cattle. Although some maintain this dosage is too low, it has seemed effective clinically when used in conjunction with penicillin not only for chronic T. pyogenes endocarditis but also for pulmonary abscesses. Therefore, if economics allow, oral rifampin has been reported to improve treatment success in cattle with bacterial endocarditis. Unfortunately, currently within the United States, the Food and Drug Administration requires that cattle treated with rifampin are not used for either commercial milk or meat production, severely limiting its use. Occasionally, cattle will become significantly anorectic while receiving rifampin (more so than was noted in association with the primary disease), but in many cases, this apparent intolerance to the drug is overcome if administration is discontinued for several days and then reinstituted at the same or lesser dose.",

Dyspnea is caused by a combination of lung compression by the enlarged pericardial mass, pulmonary edema, and reduced cardiac output. Auscultation of the heart reveals bilaterally decreased intensity of the heart sounds. This muffling of heart sounds usually coexists with squeaky, rubbing sounds and splashing or tinkling sounds, but these sounds are not present in all cases. A fluid\u2013gas interface created by gas-forming bacterial organisms in the pericardium creates the most obvious splashing sounds. Lung sounds may not be heard in the ventral third of either hemithorax because of the greatly enlarged pericardial sac displacing the lungs dorsally. In addition to these signs, there are two other very important clinical facts associated with traumatic pericarditis in dairy cattle:1.Most cows with traumatic pericarditis were observed by the owner to be ill 7 to 14 days earlier and may or may not have been diagnosed with traumatic reticuloperitonitis at that time. Frequently, the signs of illness were vague and nonspecific, and veterinary attention may or may not have been requested. Typically, these cattle improve or appear recovered from this previous illness only to become ill again and have signs of cardiac disease. Certainly not all cattle have this two-phased clinical course, and some have peracute pericarditis or traumatic myocarditis and die within hours or days. When the history supports a two-phased clinical disease, it is assumed the cow transiently \u201cfelt better\u201d after the foreign body left the reticulodiaphragmatic area and entered the chest, thereby alleviating the peritoneal pain and inflammation. Subsequently, worsening sepsis in the pericardial sac and eventual heart failure causes the second phase of disease that generally moves the owner to seek veterinary consultation.2.During the acute and subacute phases of traumatic pericarditis, heart sounds may change on a daily basis. Muffling, tinkling, splashing, rubs, murmurs, and other sounds all may be present on one day, absent the next, and present again later. Pathology is dynamic as the relative amounts of fibrin, purulent fluid, and gas in the pericardium change. Chronic cases, on the other hand, tend to have bilateral muffling of heart sounds and a \u201cfar away\u201d tinkling as fluid pus is jostled by heartbeats.\n",

Thoracic radiographs, if available, also may be definitive. Fluid and fibrin in the pericardial sac are easily visualized with two-dimensional echocardiography (Fig. 3.37, Fig. 3.36\n). Heavy accumulation of fibrin coats the epicardium and visceral pericardium (Fig. 3.38\n). This fibrin frequently has the appearance of \u201cscrambled eggs\u201d when seen on postmortem examination (Fig. 3.39\n). Depending on the severity and stage of the disease secondary ultrasonographic signs of cardiac tamponade can be observed with ventricular collapse during diastole, atrial collapse during ventricular systole or a \u201cswinging heart.\u201d Septic pericarditis (either traumatic after hardware disease or secondary to contiguous pulmonary infection), cardiac lymphosarcoma, and idiopathic hemorrhagic pericardial (IHP) effusion are the most common causes of pericardial effusion in cattle. In all cases, a pericardiocentesis under ultrasonographic guidance should be performed to characterize the nature of the pericardial effusion. Other physical examination and clinicopathologic data often heavily suggest the pathogenesis for each of these differentials, but definitive diagnosis is almost always provided by simple cytologic examination of a sample of the effusion.",

After clipping and standard preparation of the left thorax, a skin puncture is performed with a scalpel in the fifth ICS just dorsal to the elbow. If continuous drainage is desired, a 20-Fr chest trochar and catheter may be introduced into the pericardium for further drainage. The fluid obtained is purulent and fetid with septic reticulopericarditis. Fibrin clots frequently obstruct flow of the fluid through finer gauge needles or catheters. The purulent fluid greatly exceeds normal values for pericardial fluid (normal; protein <2.5 g/dL, white blood cell count [WBC] \u2264 5000/\u03bcL), and neutrophils are the major cellular component rather than the mononuclear cells normally found in pericardial fluid. Bacteria are easily detected in gram-stained smears of this fluid. With ultrasound guidance, as has become commonplace, it is frequently possible to access the pericardial sac from either the left or the right side (see Fig. 3.31), potentially through several ICSs, so significant is the enlargement and volume of fluid within the pericardium. However, it is advisable that the fifth ICS on the left always be used for diagnostic sampling for cytology. Many cattle with pericardial effusions will also have some degree of pleural effusion, and it can be challenging to differentiate the two spaces ultrasonographically such is the deviation from normal anatomy and the sheer enlargement of the respective spaces. Although septic disease often has comparable cytology in both effusions, this is not always the case for neoplastic disease, nor with idiopathic hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.",

Cytology of pericardial fluid would clearly differentiate between these diseases. The prognosis for cattle with the idiopathic hemorrhagic condition appears to be better after drainage and antiinflammatory therapy than for pericarditis associated with sepsis or neoplasia (see later section).

Medical therapy with systemic antibiotics and drainage of the pericardial sac rarely, if ever, permanently cures affected cattle. Therefore most therapeutic efforts have included surgical approaches. Thoracotomy and pericardiectomy or pericardiotomy have been performed in many fashions in an effort to provide drainage, search for the foreign body, and prevent fluid or later constrictive damage to the heart ( see Video Clip 3.6). Sporadic case reports and third-hand stories attest to the occasional success of pericardiectomy and fifth rib resections, but success is not common. Authors recommending rib-splitting thoracotomy and pericardiectomy reported that five of nine clinical patients recovered. Results from Cornell University, as reported by Ducharme and coworkers, are much more pessimistic with only one of seven surviving following thoracic surgery. Pericardiocentesis followed by fluid drainage may result in clinical improvement with prolongation of life to reach a short-term goal such as calving.

Usually the wire is mostly or completely in the thorax and would be difficult or impossible to remove through rumenotomy. However, we have observed patients with acute reticuloperitonitis and acute traumatic pericarditis from a single metallic foreign body that was still lodged in the reticulum and was removed through rumenotomy. These patients had clinically detectable pericardial effusions and radiographic evidence of foreign body penetration of the pericardium. Rumenotomy and intensive bactericidal systemic antibiotics are sometimes sufficient treatment of peracute or acute pericarditis in such cases. If pericarditis worsens despite systemic antibiotics and rumenotomy to retrieve the foreign body, thoracotomy may then be considered. Rumenotomy probably is most indicated in acute cases for which it is hoped that some portion of the metallic foreign object remains in the reticulum. Unfortunately, it is difficult to know this without the benefit of radiographs, and an unsuccessful rumenotomy in the field may further compromise the patient.",

            "text": "Over the past decade, we have seen a seemingly new form of pericardial disease manifest itself in dairy cattle in the northern United States and Canada. The initial reports of the condition were case reports or small case series of individual adult cattle presented to university teaching hospitals with signs of congestive heart failure associated with substantial volumes of hemorrhagic pericardial fluid. Diagnostic workup of these cases demonstrated that cytologically the effusion was neither neoplastic nor septic but merely hemorrhagic and that extended survival times could be achieved with pericardial drainage and parenteral corticosteroid administration. In many cases, the effusion would resolve with such treatment, and cattle would return to milk production or reproductive use for a variable period from several months to years. In the past decade, it has increased in prevalence to the point that at the time of writing, it is now the most common cardiac condition of cattle presenting to the University of Wisconsin\u2019s Large Animal Hospital. Subsequent literature has highlighted that many of these cattle go on to develop an unusual form of cardiac lymphosarcoma principally involving the epicardium in the months to years after initial presentation for cardiac disease. Occasionally, cattle have epicardial lymphosarcoma at the time of initial presentation, but we have seen cattle for whom the delay in progression from initial treatment of the nonneoplastic hemorrhagic pericardial effusion to euthanasia for epicardial lymphosarcoma has been in excess of 3 years. The gross appearance of the epicardial neoplasia is quite strikingly different to that seen with classic cardiac lymphosarcoma involving the myocardium. It seems extremely rare for cattle with cardiac lymphosarcoma to have neoplastic infiltration of both myocardial and epicardial locations, although both may show infiltration of thoracic or mediastinal lymph nodes locally. In cases when cattle have been euthanized or died with the disease, without any gross or histologic evidence of lymphosarcoma, the epicardial surface of the heart has a network of highly vascular fibroelastic connective tissue, which is presumably the source of the hemorrhagic effusion (Fig. 3.40\n). Fulminant cases of epicardial lymphosarcoma have variably florid and highly extensive amounts of this highly vascular connective tissue within which it appears the neoplasia has developed, raising the possibility that it behaves as a \u201cscaffold\u201d for transformed lymphocytes (Fig. 3.42, Fig. 3.41\n).

It can be seen in either lactating or dry animals, although many are in mid to late lactation at the time of diagnosis. A large retrospective study of 125 cases demonstrated a median age and days in milk of 47 months and 262 days, respectively. Many affected cattle have been producing expected levels of milk immediately before diagnosis and are often average- to high-producing animals compared with herdmates. However, the stage of lactation at which animals appear to be commonly affected certainly puts them into a group for whom there may not be such intense health-related oversight unless they are individually valuable or daily milk weights are recorded and checked.

This is most readily achieved by echocardiography and pericardiocentesis. Routine hematology and biochemistry can be useful for exclusionary purposes in that there is an absence of hyperfibrinogenemia, mature neutrophilia, and hyperglobulinemia such as one would expect with septic pericarditis caused by hardware disease. There may well be a significant and persistent lymphocytosis in cattle with this condition who are also BLV positive, which may also be true in cases of right atrial lymphosarcoma. Biochemical abnormalities are infrequent, although many cattle demonstrate elevations in gamma-glutamyl transferase likely associated with passive hepatic congestion of cardiac origin. Pericardial fluid reliably appears bloody, typically has a packed cell volume (PCV) of between 10% and 15%, with a mildly elevated total protein, and a cytologic mixture of nondegenerate neutrophils, macrophages, and small lymphocytes. The latter usually represent the majority of the cells on cytologic examination even if the cow does not have a peripheral lymphocytosis. These small lymphocytes are phenotypically unremarkable in the majority of cases at the time of first diagnosis, but as mentioned earlier, over time this can transition into an obviously lymphoblastic population. Transabdominal ultrasound examination often confirms hepatic congestion, intrahepatic vessel prominence, and commonly a moderate degree of ascites. Thoracic ultrasonography and echocardiography are highly informative and the effusion(s) so marked that either a medium-frequency sector scanner or lower frequency cardiac probe can be used. Echocardiographic findings from either side of the chest include a large volume of predominantly anechoic fluid within the pericardial sac (5\u201325 cm in depth) ( see Video Clip 3.7) often accompanied by a moderate but smaller volume of pleural fluid (see Fig. 3.4). The latter is more likely in individuals with a particularly large volume of pericardial effusion. The epicardial surface of the heart is often coated with more hyperechoic-appearing tissue that projects like fronds of seaweed into the more anechoic fluid within the pericardium, having an ultrasonographic appearance reminiscent of fibrin. The anechoic nature of the pericardial fluid is notably different from that seen with septic pericardial disease, which tends to be more heterogeneous and frequently contains gas shadows (compare Fig. 3.4, Fig. 3.37).

Severe chronic interstitial pulmonary disease, although rare, may also result in cor pulmonale in mature cattle with diffuse pulmonary fibrosis. Occasionally, calves with chronic pulmonary disease or those with congenital defects leading to chronic hypoxia and pulmonary hypertension may also develop this problem, but this represents a very small fraction of all calves with even severe or repeated bouts of conventional bronchopneumonia. In calves in which we have observed it, the radiographic and pathologic interpretation of the calf\u2019s disease has included both concurrent interstitial disease as well as the more common bronchopneumonia. In cases of cor pulmonale, pulmonary hypertension initially may result from alveolar hypoxia and subsequent precapillary vasoconstriction. Chronic hypoxia and pulmonary hypertension in cattle may provoke hypertrophy of medial smooth musculature within pulmonary arteries and arterioles, causing further work for the right ventricle.

Similar suspicions exist in cattle, but we know of no work that confirms this theory pathologically. In addition, cattle with atrial fibrillation that persists more than 1 month after resolution of a GI or medical problem may in fact have myocardial disease causing atrial fibrillation or acquire heart disease because the noncontracting atria will develop progressive dilation that eventually results in tricuspid and mitral valve regurgitation. It also is possible that some cows with persistent atrial fibrillation had it before the onset of their medical or GI disease. Therefore, discussions of appropriate criteria on which to base treatment are subjective. If medical or surgical therapy for the primary illness fails to resolve the atrial fibrillation, it is difficult to know how much the arrhythmia might contribute to any ongoing inappetence, depression, and decreased milk production. It seems that cattle, similar to horses, can be remarkably tolerant of chronic atrial fibrillation provided there is not concurrent, significant cardiac disease.

Because septic thrombophlebitis predisposes to bacterial endocarditis in cattle, careful auscultation of the heart is indicated in all cases (Fig. 3.48\n). Tissue necrosis associated with extremely irritating drugs (e.g., 50% dextrose, 20% sodium iodide, and phenylbutazone) placed perivascularly or resulting in thrombophlebitis eventually will cause sloughing, cellulitis, or sterile abscess formation. Bacterial contamination of such lesions ensures abscess formation and eventual drainage.",

Endocarditis may result in thrombosis of renal or pulmonary arteries. Claviceps purpurea, the cause of fescue foot or ergotism, may cause thrombosis of limb, ear, and tail arteries. Severe frost bite of distal extremities, especially in septic calves, may also cause vascular thrombosis of distal extremities (Fig. 3.60\n). The prognosis for frostbitten extremities can be determined after rewarming the affected sites and assessing the severity of necrosis and thrombosis. Rewarming the frostbitten area as quickly as possible to salvage as much tissue and function as possible is suggested. The use of circulating water at 40\u00b0C is recommended. Do not allow the water to get too hot or too cold. Avoid premature termination of the rewarming process. Remember to treat pain associated with rewarming and provide antibiotic and surgical treatments as needed. Mechanical trauma (from over-vigorous massaging or rubbing), rewarming at too high temperatures, and allowing refreezing are some of the commonest errors in treatment. Anticoagulants such as heparin may be of some value in decreasing further thrombosis but can have side effects; aspirin, however, has minimal effects on coagulation in cattle. Tissue plasminogen activator could be injected proximal to the thrombosis if the thrombosis is acute but it is very expensive.",
