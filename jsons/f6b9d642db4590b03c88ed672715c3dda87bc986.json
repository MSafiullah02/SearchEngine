While there are many studies involving fake news and tools on how to detect it, there is a limited amount of work that focuses on the use of information literacy to assist people to critically access online information and news. Critical thinking, as a form of information literacy, provides a means to critically engage with online content, for example by looking for evidence to support claims and by evaluating the plausibility of arguments. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current state of knowledge on the use of critical thinking to identify fake news. A systematic literature review (SLR) has been performed to identify previous studies on evaluating the credibility of news, and in particular to see what has been done in terms of the use of critical thinking to evaluate online news. During the SLR's sifting process, 22 relevant studies were identified. Although some of these studies referred to information literacy, only three explicitly dealt with critical thinking as a means to identify fake news. The studies on critical thinking noted critical thinking as an essential skill for identifying fake news. The recommendation of these studies was that information literacy be included in academic institutions, specifically to encourage critical thinking.",

People no longer rely on television and print media alone for obtaining news, but increasingly make use of social media and news apps. The variety of information sources that we have today has contributed to the spread of alternative facts [1] . With over 1.8 billion active users per month in 2016 [2] , Facebook accounted for 20% of total traffic to reliable websites and up to 50% of all the traffic to fake news sites [3] . Twitter comes second to Facebook, with over 400 million active users per month [2] . Posts on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter spread rapidly due to how they attempt to grab the readers' attention as quickly as possible, with little substantive information provided, and thus create a breeding ground for the dissemination of fake news [4] .",

This means that any person who is in possession of a device, which can connect to the internet, is potentially a consumer or distributor of fake news. While social media platforms and search engines do not encourage people to believe the information being circulated, they are complicit in people's propensity to believe the information they come across on these platforms, without determining their validity [6] .

            "text": "Although fake news has received increased attention recently, the term has been used by scholars for many years [4] . Fake news emerged from the tradition of yellow journalism of the 1890s, which can be described as a reliance on the familiar aspects of sensationalism-crime news, scandal and gossip, divorces and sex, and stress upon the reporting of disasters, sports sensationalism as well as possibly satirical news [5] . The emergence of online news in the early 2000s raised concerns, among them being that people who share similar ideologies may form \"echo chambers\" where they can filter out alternative ideas [2] . This emergence came about as news media transformed from one that was dominated by newspapers printed by authentic and trusted journalists to one where online news from an untrusted source is believed by many [5] . The term later grew to describe \"satirical news shows\", \"parody news shows\" or \"fake-news comedy shows\" where a television show, or segment on a television show was dedicated to political satire [4] . Some of these include popular television shows such as The Daily Show (now with Trevor Noah), Saturday Night Live's \"The Weekend Update\" segment, and other similar shows such as Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and The Colbert Report with Stephen Colbert [4] . News stories in these shows were labelled \"fake\" not because of their content, but for parodying network news for the use of sarcasm, and using comedy as a tool to engage real public issues [4] . The term \"Fake News\" further became prominent during the course of the 2016 US presidential elections, as members of the opposing parties would post incorrect news headlines in order to sway the decision of voters [6] .",

            "text": "The term fake news has a more literal meaning today [4] . The Macquarie Dictionary named fake news the word of the year for 2016 [8] . In this dictionary, fake news is described it as a word that captures a fascinating evolution in the creation of deceiving content, also allowing people to believe what they see fit. There are many definitions for the phrase, however, a concise description of the term can be found in Paskin [4] who states that certain news articles originating from either social media or mainstream (online or offline) platforms, that are not factual, but are presented as such and are not satirical, are considered fake news. In some instances, editorials, reports, and expos\u00e9s may be knowingly disseminating information with intent to deceive for the purposes of monetary or political benefit [4] . A distinction amongst three types of fake news can be made on a conceptual level, namely: serious fabrications, hoaxes and satire [3] . Serious fabrications are explained as news items written on false information, including celebrity gossip. Hoaxes refer to false information provided via social media, aiming to be syndicated by traditional news platforms. Lastly, satire refers to the use of humour in the news to imitate real news, but through irony and absurdity. Some examples of famous satirical news platforms in circulation in the modern day are The Onion and The Beaverton, when contrasted with real news publishers such as The New York Times [3] .",

Information literacy is no longer a nice-to-have proficiency but a requirement for interpreting news headlines and participation in public discussions. It is essential for academic institutions of higher learning to present information literacy courses that will empower students and staff members with the prerequisite tools to identify, select, understand and use trustworthy information [1] . Outside of its academic uses, information literacy is also a lifelong skill with multiple applications in everyday life [5] . The choices people make in their lives, and opinions they form need to be informed by the appropriate interpretation of correct, opportune, and significant information [5] .",

As preparation for the data analysis, a data extraction table was made that classified each article according to the following: article author; article title; theme (a short summary of the article); year; country; and type of publication. The data extraction table assisted in the analysis of findings as presented in the next section. Due to the limited number of relevant studies, the information search did not have a specified start date. Articles were included up to 31 August 2019. The majority of the papers found were published in 2017 (8 papers) and 2018 (9 papers). This is in line with the term \"fake news\" being announced the word of the year in the 2016 [8] . The selected papers were classified into themes. Figure 2 is a Venn diagram that represents the overlap of articles by themes across the review. Articles that fall under the \"fake news\" theme had the highest number of occurrences, with 11 in total. Three articles focused mainly on \"Critical Thinking\", and \"Information Literacy\" was the main focus of four articles. Two articles combined all three topics of critical thinking, information literacy, and fake news.",

With the influence that social media has on the drive of fake news [2] , who then becomes responsible for the dissemination and intake of fake news by the general population? The immediate assumption is that in the digital age, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter should be able to curate information, or do some form of fact-checking when posts are uploaded onto their platforms [12] , but that leans closely to infringing on freedom of speech. While different authors agree that there need to be measures in place for the minimisation of fake news being spread [12, 13] , where that accountability lies differs between the authors. Metaxas and Mustafaraj [13] aimed to develop algorithms or plug-ins that can assist in trust and postulated that consumers should be able to identify misinformation, thus making an informed decision on whether to share that information or not. Lazer et al. [12] on the other hand, believe the onus should be on the platform owners to put restrictions on the kind of data distributed. Considering that the work by Metaxas and Mustafaraj [13] was The Use of Critical Thinking to Identify Fake News: A SLR done seven years ago, one can conclude that the use of fact-checking algorithms/plugins has not been successful in curbing the propulsion of fake news.",

According to Nielsen and Graves as well as Janetzko, [6, 15] , people are unable to identify fake news correctly.

Two articles, [15] and [6] discussed the role of critical thinking when interacting on social media. Social media presents information to us that has been filtered according to what we already consume, thereby making it a challenge for consumers to think critically.

Two studies mention the effect of social and the spread of fake news, and how it may have propelled Donald Trump to win the US election in 2016 [2, 16] . Also, [8] and [2] mention how a story on the Pope supporting Trump in his presidential campaign, was widely shared (more than a million times) on Facebook in 2016. These articles also point out how in the information age, fact-checking has become relatively easy, but people are more likely to trust their intuition on news stories they consume, rather than checking the reliability of a story. The use of paid trolls and Russian bots to populate social media feeds with misinformation in an effort to swing the US presidential election in Donald Trump's favour, is highlighted [16] . The creation of fake news, with the use of alarmist headlines (\"click bait\"), generates huge traffic into the original websites, which drives up advertising revenue [2] . This means content creators are compelled to create fake news, to drive ad revenue on their websites -even though they may not be believe in the fake news themselves [2] .",

Information literacy is when a person has access to information, and thus can process the parts they need, and create ways in which to best use the information [1] . Teaching students the importance of information literacy skills is key, not only for identifying fake news but also for navigating life aspects that require managing and scrutinising information, as discussed by [1, 17] , and [9] . Courtney [17] highlights how journalism students, above students from other disciplines, may need to have some form of information literacy incorporated into their syllabi to increase their awareness of fake news stories, creating a narrative of being objective and reliable news creators. Courtney assessed different universities that teach journalism and mediarelated studies, and established that students generally lack awareness on how useful library services are in offering services related to information literacy. Courtney [17] and Rose-Wiles [9] discuss how the use of library resources should be normalised to students. With millennials and generation Z having social media as their first point of contact, Rose-Wiles [9] urges universities, colleges and other academic research institutes to promote the use of more library resources than those from the internet, to encourage students to lean on reliable sources. Overall, this may prove difficult, therefore Rose-Wiles [9] proposes that by teaching information literacy skills and critical thinking, students can use these skills to apply in any situation or information source.",

            "text": "Critical Thinking. Only three of the articles had critical thinking as a main theme. Bronstein et al. [19] discuss how certain dogmatic and religious beliefs create a tendency in individuals to belief any information given, without them having a need to interrogate the information further and then deciding ion its veracity. The article further elaborates how these individuals are also more likely to engage in conspiracy theories, and tend to rationalise absurd events. Bronstein et al.'s [19] study conclude that dogmatism and religious fundamentalism highly correlate with a belief in fake news. Their study [19] suggests the use of interventions that aim to increase open-minded thinking, and also increase analytical thinking as a way to help religious, curb belief in fake news. Howlett [20] describes critical thinking as evidence-based practice, which is taking the theories of the skills and concepts of critical thinking and converting those for use in everyday applications. Jackson [21] explains how the internet purposely prides itself in being a platform for \"unreviewed content\", due to the idea that people may not see said content again, therefore it needs to be attention-grabbing for this moment, and not necessarily accurate. Jackson [21] expands that social media affected critical thinking in how it changed the view on published information, what is now seen as old forms of information media. This then presents a challenge to critical thinking in that a large portion of information found on the internet is not only unreliable, it may also be false. Jackson [21] posits that one of the biggest dangers to critical thinking may be that people have a sense of perceived power for being able to find the others they seek with a simple web search. People are no longer interested in evaluation the credibility of the information they receive and share, and thus leading to the propagation of fake news [21] .",
