Gastrointestinal infections and subsequent diarrhea and dehydration account for the majority of mortality and morbidity of neonatal calves (USDA, 2010). Common practices employed by producers to treat diarrhea include electrolyte therapy to replace lost fluids, or the administration of antibiotics to combat invading pathogens (Lorenz et al., 2011). However, the extensive use of antibiotics may result in antibiotic resistant pathogens, posing a potential risk of exposure for calves and humans (Friedman et al., 2007). As such, alternatives to antibiotics for preventing and treating diarrhea are desirable.",

Recent studies in monogastrics have demonstrated that feeding Saccharomyces cerevisiae var boulardii (SCB), a subtype of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) species, could reduce the risk of enteric diseases by blocking pathogenic toxin receptors sites, destructing pathogenic toxin receptors, inhibiting the growth of some pathogens within the intestinal lumen, and/or regulating immune responses (McFarland, 2010, Kelesidis and Pothoulakis, 2012). At birth, the digestive system of a calf functions similarly to that of a monogastric animal (Drackley, 2008). Because of this similarity, we hypothesized that feeding SCB would have similar effects in calves, thereby improving their gastrointestinal health and growth. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementing SCB in milk replacer (MR) during the pre-weaning period on intake, growth and health of calves.",

Forty-two male Holstein calves, averaging 42.6 \u00b1 0.77 kg at birth, were used. The calves were removed from the dam within 2 h of birth, ear tagged, weighed, and housed in individual pens with straw bedding. The calves were given 4 L of quality colostrum (>50 mg/mL of immunoglobulin G) within 3 h of birth and another 3 L of fresh colostrum at the next set feeding time. After the second colostrum feeding, calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments: 1) Control: a treatment fed commercial MR; or 2) Treat: a treatment fed commercial MR additionally supplemented with 5 g of live SCB product per day which was expected to supply 10 billion colony-forming units of SCB to each calf daily. The SCB product (ProTernative\u00ae Milk; Levucell SB20 containing the Pasteur Institute CNCM I-1079 strain of SCB; Lallemand Animal Nutrition, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) was mixed with MR in a bucket for each calf daily before morning feeding and given to them at the first feeding of the day. All calves were fed the MR solution by a nipple bottle (Super Calf Nipple; Merrick\u2019s, Middleton, Wisconsin, USA) during the first week of life, and then transitioned at 7 \u00b1 3 d to a gate-mounted artificial teat (Peach Teats; Skellerup Industries Ltd., Woolston, New Zealand). The artificial teat feeding setup consisted of the teat mounted at the front of the pen, attached to a tube fitted with a one-way valve, running into a 8-L bucket placed outside the pen. The MR used in this study contained 260 g/kg crude protein, 160 g/kg crude fat, and 4.58 Mcal/kg metabolizable energy (ME) on a dry matter (DM) basis (MapleviewAgri, Palmerston, Ontario, Canada), and were mixed to 150 g/L with 40 \u00b0C water. For the first 2 days, MR was fed 3 times per day (0700, 1600 and 2100 h) with 3 L given at each of the first 2 feedings and 2 L at the third feeding. From day 3 until weaning at day 42, MR was fed in 2 equal volumes daily at 0700 and 1600 h, with 8 L offered daily from day 3 to 34, and 4 L daily from day 35 to 42. Calves also received ad libitum calf starter containing 220 g/kg crude protein, 37 g/kg crude fat, 57 g/kg crude fibre and 2.63 Mcal/kg ME on a DM basis (Nieuwland Feeds Elora Ltd., Elora, Ontario, Canada) from day 7 of age. They also had free access to water throughout the experiment.",

A variety of microbial species, such as Bacillus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Saccharomyces yeast (Simon et al., 2001), have been used in livestock as probiotics products. The present study investigated the effects of supplementing a Saccharomyces yeast product on dairy calf growth performance and its potential to improve animal health. The lack of treatment effect on intake and performance in this study was in agreement with Quigley et al. (1992), who observed no difference in feed intake or BW gain of calves fed a yeast culture product supplemented in a starter feed. In contrast, Lesmeister et al. (2004) reported that including 20 g/kg of SC yeast culture in a starter feed improved DM intake and BW gain of young calves, but there was no effect when the supplementing dose of yeast culture was reduced to 1 g/kg. Galv\u00e3o et al. (2005) indicated that feeding a live SC supplemented into starter increased grain intake and BW gain of calves, but there was no effect when a live SCB yeast was incorporated into MR. Magalh\u00e3es et al. (2008) observed no difference in overall starter intake throughout the experimental period (week 1\u2013week 10) between control and SC group but a marginal increase from week 1 to 4 for calves fed a SC yeast culture product. Differing responses to feeding yeast products on intake and BW gain may relate to the type of yeast product (live yeast vs. yeast culture), strain of yeast, amount fed to the animal, delivery method of yeast (in milk vs. in starter), and disease challenge present.",

            "text": "The lack of treatment effect on fecal scores of calves was unexpected. In young calves, although fecal scores were similar between treatments, Galv\u00e3o et al. (2005) reported that the calves fed SCB in MR had fewer days with diarrhea during pre-weaning (control vs. SCB: 5.83 vs. 4.00 days), which was inconsistent with our results. In that study, there was no difference on days with diarrhea post-weaning (control vs. SCB: 2.08 vs. 2.83 days) between control and SCB treatment; however, the high incidences of diarrhea observed after weaning, which averaged 2.45 days, suggested that the calves were still under stress post-weaning. In the current study, the fecal scores of all calves were almost 0 after weaning, and even during the most stressful week (i.e., week 2) the averaged fecal score of calves were below 2 (i.e., 1.56), which suggested that the severity level of diarrhea was very low although the days with diarrhea lasted approximately 5 days. The relatively low disease challenge of calves during this study may be partially resulted from the adequate colostrum feeding strategy. It has been commonly accepted that the consumption of an adequate quantity of high quality colostrum within the first 24 h of birth is vital for calves to successfully acquire passive immunity (Godden, 2008), which is inversely correlated with morbidity and mortality rates of calves (Meganck et al., 2014). In the current study, all calves received adequate colostrum and had STP concentrations in excess of 5.2 g/dL, which is considered to be indicative of adequate transfer of passive immunity (Weaver et al., 2000). Moreover, the good management of pre-weaned calves with a conventional medication protocol may also be a factor contributing to the relatively low disease challenge. In support, the ADG of calves during pre-weaning (over 700 g/d) even if during the most stressful period (week 2; 422 g/d) were relatively high as compared to that reported in the study of Galv\u00e3o et al. (2005); 438 g/d for calves fed control MR. The healthy condition of calves was also reinforced by the fact that all the calves had low nasal and ear scores (mostly scored 0) in this study. Therefore, the results of this study suggest the SCB effect on gastrointestinal health of calves is minimal when calves are healthy and well-managed.",

Since it has been reported that the bacterial community in fecal samples from dairy calves could represent the composition of the large-intestinal bacterial community (Uyeno et al., 2010), the current study compared 5 microbial markers associated with animal growth and health in feces from control and treated calves to evaluate the probiotics effect on gut microbiota. Since E. coli is one of the most common and important causes of neonatal diarrhea in dairy calves (Muktar et al., 2015), the lack of an SCB treatment effect on the fecal E. coli population was consistent with the fecal score results and suggests that feeding SCB may not alter the gastrointestinal E. coli population in healthy calves. Our results also provided quantified data that the calves with an averaged 108\n \u223c 109 16S rRNA gene copy/g (up to 0.3% of total bacteria) fecal E. coli population at day 7 after birth did not show significant symptoms of diarrhea. Moreover, the lack of beneficial bacterial population changes (i.e., Clostridium cluster XIVa and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium) in fecal samples from treated calves suggested that feeding SCB may have no effect on gut microflora.",

In the current study, Clostridium were present in the feces of dairy calves in great abundance, and the population of Clostridium cluster XIVa increased with week of age, from 7.8 \u00d7 1010 (21.40% of total bacteria) at day 7 after birth to 3.9 \u00d7 1011 gene copy/g (27.86% of total bacteria) at day 35. The population of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was also affected by week of age, which increased from 1.2 \u00d7 109 (0.41% of total bacteria) at day 7 to 2.2 \u00d7 1010 gene copy/g (1.57% of total bacteria) at day 35. The dynamic changes on fecal bacterial populations of dairy calves during the first 8 weeks corresponded to a previous study by Uyeno et al. (2010) who found that the Chao1 index gradually increased from the first to the seventh week of life. In fact, during the first 8 weeks after birth, calves not only experienced an age change, but were also challenged by a diet transition from milk to solid feed (Khan et al., 2016). It has been reported that solid feed consumption altered gut microbiome during weaning transition (Malmuthuge et al., 2013), and the shift of gut microbiomes affected by solid feed could be toward to the mature ruminant state (Meale et al., 2016). By targeting specific bacteria, the current results suggest that the fecal microbial population in dairy calves can be influenced by week of age and weaning, and the natural microbial changes occurring over time in the life of a health calf appears to be more important than the expected SCB effect. Nevertheless, since there were only fecal samples tested in the present study, it should be noted that the gut bacterial community can be further investigated to confirm the SCB and age effects on gut microbiota.",

Fecal, nasal and ear scores were low throughout the study and were not influenced by dietary treatment, which suggests minimal potential benefit from feeding SCB to improve calf\u2019s performance and health when they are in good health. Moreover, the lack of changes in fecal populations of E. coli, Clostridium cluster XIVa, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium by dietary treatment further implies that feeding yeast probiotics has no additive effect when there is no disease challenge for calves.",
