            "text": "The diseases that affect calves can have a substantial economic impact on beef and dairy farms, and most cases concern animals that are less than 1 mo old. The two most frequent diseases are diarrhea and respiratory disease (Sivula et al., 1996; USDA, 2010). Umbilical infection is the third most common disease during the first few months of life, affecting between 1.3% (Svensson et al., 2003) and 29% of newborn dairy calves (Virtala et al., 1996). As well as the costs of treating sick calves and the time this requires, the economic losses resulting from calf diseases may also include increased mortality (Sivula et al., 1996), reduced weight gain (Virtala et al., 1996) or longevity (Britney et al., 1984), and older age at first calving (Stanton et al., 2012). Previous studies had demonstrated the genetic component of diseases affecting calves (Heringstad et al., 2008; Henderson et al., 2011). Genetic and genomic selection therefore represent a potential strategy to increase resistance to these diseases, but necessitate the collection of additional phenotypic data beyond what is included in most of the national databases used for genetic evaluation. In addition, little research has been dedicated to the health of beef calves when compared to studies on dairy (and particularly Holstein) calves. Because French breeders were interested in improving the viability of Charolais beef calves, 16 herds were recruited for the purposes of this study, during which records were kept on calf health performance between birth and 1 mo of age. These records included birth weight (BW), calving ease (CE) score, vigor of the calf at birth [hereinafter referred to as neonatal vitality (NV)], survival, and all health events occurring between birth and 1 mo of age. The aim of the study was to estimate the genetic parameters for all these traits in order to answer three key questions relative to the value and feasibility of genetic selection to ensure young calf health: 1) Is it feasible to select calf health traits directly? 2) What pathologies should be included in such a health breeding scheme? 3) Can we select health traits indirectly through selection that focuses more generally on the performance of the young calf (BW, CE or NV)?",

The final research dataset (Table 1) included data on 2,740 calves produced by 2,044 dams and 252 sires in 16 connected herds. The parent pedigrees of all calves had been registered for at least two generations of ancestors. Among the 252 sires, 112 bulls were also maternal grandsires of the calves, because they were sires of 839 dams. The two INRA experimental Charolais farms, located at Bourges (in the Berry region) and at Pin-aux-Haras (in Normandy) were among these 16 herds. All 16 herds were managed according to a standard suckler herd production system, in which calves were reared by their dams until 6 to 8 mo of age. With the exception of the INRA experimental unit in Bourges (where the animals were housed indoors throughout the year), the animals were indoors between late November and April and pastured outside for the other months of the year.",

The time periods were defined in such a way as to account for existing knowledge on the different age-related causes of infections that cause diarrhea (Gruenberg, 2016). For example, infection by Escherichia coli is seen within the first 5 d of life, rarely later. Infection by rotavirus, coronavirus, and other viruses is frequently observed in calves that are 5\u201315 d old. Cryptosporidiosis is seen in calves older than 5 d but most commonly during the second and third weeks of life, while coccidiosis only appears after 3 wk of age (Gillhuber et al., 2014). Thus, the health events considered for the genetic analysis were umbilical infections occurring between 0 and 5 d of age (Umb1) or between 6 and 20 d of age (Umb2), and diarrhea occurring between 0 and 5 d of age (Diar1), between 6 and 20 d of age (Diar2), or between 21 and 30 d of age (Diar3). The frequency of navel illness between 21 and 30 d of age (Umb3) was too low (Table 1) to estimate genetic parameters; this was also the case for other diseases (including respiratory diseases) recorded in the 2 yr of data that we examined (Table 3).",

However, when dealing with small herds, or if some scores are absent within certain herd-years, the herd-year effects in threshold models cannot be estimated as fixed effects; instead, they are considered to be random. This type of statistical treatment of herd-year effects is incorrect from a theoretical point of view as it creates errors in the ranking of animals based on their estimated breeding values (Phocas and Lalo\u00eb, 2003). Because of this, the discrete nature of most of the traits under analysis was ignored, as a linear model can perform as well as, or better than, a threshold model when the amount of information per level of effect is low. This is especially true when confounding effects are suspected between the herd genetic level and herd management performance due to moderate genetic links between beef cattle herds (Phocas and Lalo\u00eb, 2003). In addition, estimates of genetic correlations are not affected by the statistical treatment (linear or threshold model) of the categorical trait (Kadarmideen et al., 2003).

As a result, 10 different five-trait analyses were performed in order to obtain at least 2 different estimates of any of the two-by-two correlations between traits. Some correlations were fixed at the boundary value of 0.999 or \u22120.999 by the software in order to maximize the likelihood of the data.

With a rate of slightly over 96%, our results regarding calf survival at 30 d were clearly higher than the national average (93%) for Charolais calves recorded between 2005 and 2011 (Leclerc et al., 2016). In the 16 experimental herds, the mortality rate between birth and 30 d was within the range of the national value for perinatal mortality among Charolais calves. In France as a whole (Leclerc et al., 2016), 3.8% of Charolais calves die within the first 48 h, while in the experimental herds this rate was only 1.5%. The survival of male calves was 2 percentage points below that of females (95% vs. 97%; Fig. 1). This sex difference in survival is partly due to birth difficulties linked to weight, as males weigh an average of 3 kg more at birth. Average BW values were similar to those recorded at a national scale in Charolais herds (Guerrier and Leudet, 2015). The distributions of CE and NV scores in our dataset are shown in Table 2. Nearly 88% of calves were born without any assistance or only an easy pull (CE < 3) and 84.5% were vigorous at birth (NV < 3). In the experimental herds, calving events not requiring assistance were 11 points below the rate of 68% observed at a national scale (Guerrier and Leudet, 2015), while the proportion of caesarians was close to the national average (4%).",

Most umbilical infections were first declared within the first 3 wk of life; only 0.4% of umbilical infections were reported between 21 and 30 d. Sivula et al.

(1996) and the USDA (2010), the majority of deaths among preweaned Holstein heifers can be attributed to diarrhea and other digestive problems, followed by respiratory problems. Calf diarrhea can be caused by both infectious agents and non-infectious factors (such as the housing environment, an inadequate intake of colostrum and waste milk). Multiple enteric pathogens are involved in the development of this disease and coinfection is frequently observed in diarrheic calves. Since the commercial availability of vaccines against Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus and coronavirus (Snodgrass et al., 1982; Crouch et al., 2000), Cryptosporidium has emerged as the principal diarrheic agent in young calves (e.g., de Graaf et al., 1999). This protozoan parasite is the etiological agent of cryptosporidiosis, which is one of the major causes worldwide of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in both humans and livestock. Cattle have been considered to be the primary reservoir for oocysts of zoonotic Cryptosporidium parvum, which is one of two species of Cryptosporidium that have been reported as being responsible for most human infections (Ryan et al., 2014). No drug therapy is yet available and the high resistance of oocysts to a range of environmental conditions and chemical treatments make cryptosporidiosis difficult to control (e.g., de Graaf et al., 1999). In France, data suggest that C. parvum is the main infectious agent behind neonatal diarrhea in both beef and dairy calves (Naciri et al., 1999). Improving the resistance of cattle to C. parvum would therefore be beneficial not only to cattle and their breeders, but also to all humans.",

The three time periods (0 to 5 d; 6 to 20 d; 21 to 30 d) were therefore defined in such a way as to account for existing knowledge on the different age-related causes of diarrhea, but also were consistent with time points allowing to detect the most important genetic variations in the expression of the disease traits. Moving only of a few days any time points led also to less consistent results in the partitioning of direct and maternal genetic variances across the different time periods. These preliminary results suggested that calves answered to different causes of infections through various biological pathways.",

As demonstrated by Cl\u00e9ment et al. (2001), a reduced model (with one or more existing effects omitted, such as the maternal genetic effect) caused variable bias of the true value, arising from confusion between different variance components. By contrast, fitting unnecessary random effects yielded neither biased estimates (genetic parameters relative to these effects being either equal to zero or nonestimable) nor substantial losses affecting the accuracy of the estimates. We therefore considered any random effect that might explain at least 1% of phenotypic variance (even with a large standard error) in the most parsimonious model with a log-likelihood very close to that of the full model. Our results showed that maternal genetic variance was null for all disease traits recorded during the period between 21 and 30 d. Nor was maternal genetic variance significant (less than 1% of phenotypic variance) for CE and NV in our dataset. As a result, the maternal genetic component was not considered for CE, NV and Diar3 in the final multitrait analysis. Our preliminary univariate analysis also showed that no common maternal environmental variance existed for any umbilical disease trait. This effect was not therefore considered in the model of resistance to umbilical infection. Furthermore, no direct genetic effect was found for Diar1 and Umb2.",

In particular, a comparison with previous results from a large French Charolais dataset (Phocas and Lalo\u00eb, 2004) revealed that the values for direct heritability were quite similar in both cases. However, our estimates of maternal heritability different markedly from published results: while the 2004 analysis of Charolais cattle obtained estimates of 12% and 3% for CE and BW, respectively, in the present study we detected no maternal heritability for CE and a value close to 6% for BW. These differences could be explained by the limited number of years covered by the records in the current dataset and by our assumption of a genetic independence of direct and maternal genetic effects for all traits. The previous study had indeed estimated the correlation between direct and maternal genetic effects to be around \u22120.4 (Phocas and Lalo\u00eb, 2004).",

For direct genetic effects, heritability ranged from 0 for early diarrhea to 2% for late diarrhea, with standard errors as large as the estimates (Table 5). Conversely, the heritability of maternal genetic effects ranged from 4.8% for early to 0% for late diarrhea (Table 5). Significantly, higher proportions of phenotypic variance for diarrhea were explained by maternal common environmental effects (Table 6) rather than any genetic effects (Table 5). This was especially true for the Diar2 trait, for which the maternal common environment, maternal genetic and direct genetic effects explained 8.7%, 2.4%, and 1.6% of phenotypic variance, respectively. A newborn beef calf only receives maternal antibodies and cell-mediated immunity via passive transfer by consuming colostrum. The degree to which maternal genetic and common environmental effects affect calf resistance to early and intermediate age diarrhea is therefore closely related to the consumption by calves of high-quality colostrum in sufficient quantities (Cho and Yoon, 2014).",

However, our results indicated that this trend could only be due to environmental factors, since no significant common maternal environmental (Table 6) or direct genetic (Table 5) correlations were detected between these traits. We also estimated correlation values between direct genetic effects and between environmental (both common maternal and residual) effects for CE and BW, as has generally been reported in the literature. However, our estimate of the direct genetic correlation between BW and CE (Table 5) was higher (0.86) than the previous estimate (0.66) published for French Charolais cattle (Phocas and Lalo\u00eb, 2004). The common maternal environmental correlation between NV and Surv was null (Table 6). By contrast, the favorable direct genetic correlation between NV and Surv indicated that calves which were more vigorous at birth had a higher probability of surviving to 1 mo of age (Table 5). This result supported previous phenotypic results obtained in Brahman cattle, where 39% of the calves that did not survive until weaning (excluding stillbirths) displayed weak NV (Riley et al., 2004). Therefore, early calf death could potentially be reduced by means of genetic improvement targeting NV rather than survival, as the former trait has a significantly higher heritability. The strong direct correlation between Surv and CE found during our study (Table 5) was consistent with the phenotypic results obtained by Lombard et al. (2007), who showed that dystocia led not only to a rise in stillborn dairy calves but also an increase in the risk of subsequent mortality up to 30 d.",

However, this antagonism needs to be further confirmed on a larger scale. Future studies should also examine the correlation between the direct genetic effects for Umb1 and maternal genetic effects for Umb2 in order to obtain a clearer understanding of the genetic determinism of umbilical infections. The bacterial agents most commonly encountered are not specific to umbilical infection; rather they are micro-organisms that cause suppurative infections, whose presence is generally a sign of the microbial environment or poor local hygienic conditions. As well as causing local infection and inflammation, these bacteria can spread by via the blood into joints, the liver or other organs, causing severe complications and impairing the calf growth (Virtala et al., 1996) or longevity in the longer term (Britney et al., 1984). Unfortunately, we lacked sufficient information to interpret our results regarding umbilical infections in greater detail.",

Environmental factors associated with the occurrence of calf diarrhea are linked to peripartum calving management and feeding, calf immunity, herd size, and environmental stress or contamination (Cho and Yoon, 2014). Escherichia coli K99, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium are the most important enteropathogens associated with diarrhea in calves younger than 1 mo (e.g., Gillhuber et al., 2014). Differentiating these bacterial, viral and parasitic agents is only possible using a diagnostic test, not by clinical examination. Coinfection is frequently observed in diarrheic calves, although a single primary pathogen may be the cause in some cases. Large-scale testing in the field is too expensive, so it is important to base preventive measures and the control of calf diarrhea on a thorough understanding of the complexities of the disease (Cho and Yoon, 2014). Because genetic resistance to diarrhea at early, intermediate and later ages seems to be moderately, but favorably, correlated, selective breeding may constitute an effective means of preventing some diarrhea outbreaks. In particular, breeding efforts that take advantage of the strong maternal heritability of early diarrhea resistance may be sufficient to yield a significant response, and indirect selection criteria need to be proposed in order to improve the direct genetic resistance of calves against diarrhea at later stages.",

Likewise, the maternal genetic effects associated with the resistance of calves to early umbilical infections were also favorably, but moderately, correlated (0.49) with maternal genetic resistance to early diarrhea. By contrast, a strong negative correlation (tending towards \u22121) was estimated between maternal genetic resistance to Umb1 and Diar2. In addition, strongly unfavorable maternal genetic correlations were estimated between Umb2 and both Diar1 (\u22120.68) and Diar2 (\u22120.85). These results suggest that selection to improve maternal genetic resistance to late umbilical infection may adversely affect resistance to diarrhea, as well as maternal genetic resistance to early umbilical infection. Until these results can be corroborated or disputed using a larger dataset, we would not recommend the use of Umb2 as a selection criterion for the improvement of general calf health. Instead, our data suggest that selection on both maternal and direct genetic resistance to early umbilical infection (Umb1) could potentially improve resistance to early umbilical infection and early and late diarrhea.",

The only exception to this concerned the maternal genetic correlation between BW and Diar1, which tended towards \u22121 (Table 5), meaning that the maternal genetic effects which increased BW had a favorable effect on reducing the occurrence of early diarrhea. Similarly, McCorquodale et al. (2013) showed that Holstein heifer calves with lower BW were more susceptible to illness during the first 3 wk of life. However, because BW and Surv were unfavorably linked during our study in terms of both direct and maternal genetic effects (Table 5), BW does not seem to represent a useful selection criterion to improve survival or any calf disease trait. As a general rule, survival during the first month of life is strongly dependent on both dystocia and the onset of diarrhea. Diarrhea may be fatal by causing dehydration and acidosis that could result in anorexia and ataxia of the calves (e.g., Cho and Yoon, 2014). In 3-mo-old Holstein heifer calves, Sivula et al. (1996) estimated case-fatality risks at approximately 18%. Dystocia increases susceptibility to environmental pathogens that may cause calf diarrhea (Larson and Tyler, 2005). Here, we found conflicting results depending on the type of effects (direct genetic, maternal genetic, or common environmental) and the age range affected by the diarrhea outbreak. Maternal common environmental effects for Surv or NV and Diar1 (and to a lesser extent Diar3) were clearly favorably associated, while maternal common environmental effects for Surv and NV appeared to be uncorrelated (Table 6). Instead, maternal genetic effects for Surv were unfavorably linked to those improving resistance in any of the three diarrhea traits (Table 5). In terms of direct genetic effects, correlation estimates demonstrated opposing trends depending on the age range for the diarrhea outbreak: the direct genetic potential for survival revealed a largely favorable genetic association with direct genetic resistance to Diar2, whereas it exhibited a strongly unfavorable association with direct genetic resistance to Diar3 (Table 5). Because estimates of direct heritability for Diar2 and Diar3 were very low (1.6% and 2%, respectively), with large standard errors (2% and 3%, respectively), we strongly question the observation that a higher genetic susceptibility to late diarrhea seemed to be associated with a better direct potential for calf survival. However, correlation estimates between direct genetic effects for NV (a trait with significant direct heritability) and Diar2 versus Diar3 displayed the same trends as those for Surv and Diar2 versus Diar3. Such counterintuitive results need to be further investigated in a study at a larger scale. In their 2013 study, McCorquodale et al. estimated that the direct heritability for treatment due to illness during the first 8 d of life was 7%, with a negative genetic correlation (\u22120.4; SE = 0.5) with survival at 4 mo of age, indicating that calves with a higher genetic susceptibility to early disease had a lower genetic survival potential. In our study, lower direct genetic survival was not only associated with lower genetic susceptibility to Diar2 but also, to a lesser extent, with lower genetic susceptibility to Umb1 (Table 5). Conversely, maternal genetic effects that improved calf survival were unfavorably linked to the maternal genetic effects involved in any disease resistance traits, with correlation estimates ranging from 0.34 (SE = 0.27) for Umb2 to 0.59 (SE = 0.53) for Diar2 (Table 5). These results were counterintuitive and require further investigation and validation in the context of large-scale studies.",

            "text": "Disease prevention in livestock can yield a range of benefits\u2014for consumers, by improving animal welfare, and by increasing productivity for farmers. Our study revealed significant genetic variability in beef cattle for the following calf health characteristics: NV, survival at 1 mo of age, early diarrhea, and umbilical infections at early and later ages. In addition, maternal genetic effects were clearly more important than direct genetic effects in explaining survival, early diarrhea and umbilical infections between 6 and 20 d of age. These initial results will need to be confirmed by future large-scale studies of beef calf health genetics. In the current era of genomics, it is now possible to perform direct genomic selection for disease resistance in calves because of the degree of genetic variation present in calf health traits if an appropriately managed reference population to evaluate several tens of thousands of phenotyped and genotyped calves is available. However, not all health traits can easily be improved simultaneously, so Charolais breeders are now faced with the major task of developing prioritized breeding objectives. For instance, selection to improve maternal genetic resistance to one type of calf infection may adversely affect resistance to other types. In addition, breeding goals should consider health traits not only directly through the use of health phenotypes, but also indirectly by using correlated traits such as calf survival or NV. Last but not least, breeders must be aware of the potential for antagonistic genetic correlations between animal health and production traits. There is a current lack of large-scale studies in cattle\u2014particularly beef cattle\u2014in which precise estimates of genetic correlations between all performance traits can be determined. Such efforts will be necessary in the future in order to implement efficient breeding schemes which can improve both production and health traits.",
