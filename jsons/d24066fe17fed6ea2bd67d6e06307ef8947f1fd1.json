The median Ct values of APs were consistently higher during hospitalization than those of APIs (Figure 2A) . The viral load of APs peaked during the first week after admission, while that of APIs peaked during the second week. We also studied serial samples from five APs and 14 APIs ( Figure 2B ).

However, the duration of viral shedding of APs and APIs was similar, which reflected the potential of APs to transmit the virus to communities (Ip et al. 2016) . Overall, our study demonstrated that even though these patients may be asymptomatic, they still have a certain period of viral shedding, which suggested the possibility of transmission during the asymptomatic period. These asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 could be an important source of the contagion that need to be controlled by longitudinal surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further studies are needed to investigate and quantify the contribution of persons with asymptomatic COVID-19 infections to COVID-19 transmission.",

New evidence has shown that the majority of coronavirus infections do not present symptoms, which indicates that a large number of asymptomatic carriers remain undiscovered in the community(Bai et al. 2020;Day 2020). To understand the natural history and infectiousness of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19, this study followed up virologically confirmed COVID-19 patients in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital who had no subjective symptoms on admission, and described their viral load and viral shedding patterns.We included 31 adult patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 and hospitalized in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from January 23 to March 3, 2020. All of these patients tested positive for SARS CoV-2 RNA according to real-time RT-PCR assays conducted by our hospital or the local CDC but were asymptomatic on admission. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (6th edition) (\"National Health Commission of China\"). In this study, a commercial real-time PCR kit (Zhongzhi, Guangzhou, China) was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected according to the characteristics were not significantly different between the AP and API groups (Supplementary",
