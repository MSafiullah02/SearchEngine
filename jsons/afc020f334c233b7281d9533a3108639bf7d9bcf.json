Both ACE and ACE2 have catalytic activity that is chloride sensitive and is caused by the presence of the CL1 and CL2 chloride-binding sites in ACE and the CL1 site in ACE2. The chloride regulation of activity is also substrate dependent. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to elucidate which of the CL1 and CL2 site residues are responsible for chloride sensitivity. The CL1 site residues Arg186, Trp279 and Arg489 of testicular ACE and the equivalent ACE2 residues Arg169, Trp271 and Lys481 were found to be critical to chloride sensitivity. Arg522 of testicular ACE was also confirmed to be vital to the chloride regulation mediated by the CL2 site. In addition, Arg514 of ACE2 was identified as a residue critical to substrate selectivity, with the R514Q mutant, relative to the wild-type, possessing a fourfold greater selectivity for the formation of the vasodilator angiotensin-(1-7) from the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. The enhancement of angiotensin II cleavage by R514Q ACE2 was a result of a 2.5-fold increase in V max compared with the wild-type. Inhibition of ACE2 was also found to be chloride sensitive, as for testicular ACE, with residues Arg169 and Arg514 of ACE2 identified as influencing the potency of the ACE2-specific inhibitor MLN-4760. Consequently, important insights into the chloride sensitivity, substrate selectivity and inhibition of testicular ACE and ACE2 were elucidated. has two homologous domains (N-and C-domains), and each of these contains an active site. tACE only possesses a single catalytic domain, which corresponds to the C-domain of sACE.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The requirement of chloride ions for the hydrolysis of angiotensin I by ACE has long been recognized [15] , and ACE2 activity is also regulated by chloride ions [16] , with the chloride regulation of both of these enzymes being substrate dependent.

Arg186 and Arg489 of tACE, and the equivalent ACE2 residues Arg169 and Lys481, coordinate the chloride ion at this site by ionic interactions [22] . The removal of this interaction by mutagenesis abolishes or greatly reduces the level of chloride sensitivity. Trp271 of ACE2 is located in close proximity to the chloride ion at the CL1 site (4.88 \u00c5 ) and lies two residues upstream of Arg273, which is known to be critical for substrate binding [26] . By mutagenesis, Trp271 and the tACE equivalent Trp279 have also been identified as residues critical to the chloride sensitivity of the two enzymes. The CL1 site is unlikely to influence zinc binding as it is 20.7 \u00c5 from this ion in tACE [22] . However, it has been suggested to be important in stabilizing complex formation for the residues in subdomain II involved directly in substrate binding [20] . The CL2 site of ACE has previously been suggested to contain the mechanistically binding chloride ion, which, when bound by the enzyme, breaks the salt bridge between Arg522 and Asp465 of C-domain sACE and facilitates the movement of Tyr523 towards the active site [30] . It was found in this study that the tACE CL2 site mutant R522Q possesses no significant chloride sensitivity, as predicted from a previous study of the equivalent R1098Q sACE mutant [25] . Arg522(Arg1098) is consequently critical to the chloride dependence of both tACE and sACE. The X-ray crystal structure of tACE reveals that Arg522, in combination with Tyr224 and a water molecule, binds the chloride ion at the CL2 site [22] . The ionic interaction of this residue with the chloride ion is therefore essential to the chloride sensitivity mediated by the CL2 site. Although the CL2 site chloride is absent in ACE2 [24] , the R514Q variant affects the chloride sensitivity of the enzyme, with the observed increase in activity being twofold less than that of the wild-type with angiotensin I and absent with angiotensin II. In ACE2, it would thus appear that this mutation is able to transmit long-range effects on the chloride sensitivity of the enzyme induced by the CL1 site. The chloride sensitivity of the tACE and ACE2 triple mutants was consistently found to be similar to that of R522Q tACE and R514Q ACE2, respectively.

The crystal structure of ACE2 reveals that the topology and chemical environment of the S 1 subsite is dictated by four residues (Tyr510, Arg514, Phe504 and Thr347), which are expected to restrict the size of substrate P 1 side-chains [24] . Therefore, the R514Q mutation most probably alters the environment of the S 1 subsite to make it more favourable for angiotensin II hydrolysis, but less favourable for angiotensin I hydrolysis.

It is therefore apparent that there are additional salt-sensitive mechanisms in vivo that influence ACE inhibitor potency, and that these override the chloride binding-induced alteration in ACE inhibitor potency observed here. The ACE2 residues Arg169 and Arg514 have been identified as critical to the potency of MLN-4760, as their mutation drastically reduces the IC 50 values recorded in comparison with the wild-type. Arg514 of ACE2 is located next to the S 1 subsite [24] , and so the R514Q mutation is hypothesized to have altered the environment of this region to one that is less accommodating to MLN-4760 binding. Arg169 of ACE2 is approximately 16 \u00c5 from the dichlorobenzyl group of MLN-4760 [24] and so is unlikely to directly hinder inhibitor binding.
