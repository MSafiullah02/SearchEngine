Researchers have utilized physical\nsciences, counting quantum material science to clarify different marvels of life. The\norganic structures of a living being are subject to physical laws; for illustration, a life\nform is an open framework and must depend on its environment to a closed framework, and it\ntakes after the moment law of thermodynamics by means of trade of data and mass and\nvitality. The infection called COVID-19, is caused by unused endemic crown infection\n(SARS-CoV-2), is odd \u2013 and appallingly particular. A later consider concluded that\nindividuals with sort A blood gather may have a better chance of contracting this modern\ncrown infection than individuals with sort O do. A few individuals tainted with the\nSARS-COV-2 infection feel alright, whereas others \u2013 indeed those who are sound and\nmoderately youthful \u2013 get exceptionally ill. The COVID-19 widespread seem have tainted 90%\nof the world populace and slaughtered more than 40.6 million individuals in the event that\nno moderation measures were put in place to combat it by the individual states all inclusive\n(Agarwal et al., 2020; Ai et al., 2020; Arshad Ali et al., 2020). As labs closed down, universally a few thousand researchers\nare redeploying to battle crown infection. So distant 19,25,440 affirmed cases of COVID-19\nhave been confirmed universally with adding up to 1,19,718 passings, and in Italy more than\n20,465 passings have been reported so far. In joined together United States of America, more\nthan 5,87,155 cases tainted by COVID-19 have been affirmed, and number is still rising. As\nthe COVID-19 flare-up quickly advances, inquire about work to create an immunization and to\ntest antivirals and other therapeutics proceeds in parallel to other measures (Abbad et al.,\n2019; Ahmed et al., 2020; Boldog et al., 2020;\nDe Salazar et al., 2020). At present, there are\nno effective drugs available for control of coronaviruses infection causes COVID-19.\nCurrently, researchers are working for development of therapeutic drugs to treat infections\nfrom coronavirus and control death cases throughout the world. The three dimensional\nstructure of the protease of SARS-CoV-2 for COVID-19 in complex with N3 (PDB ID: 6LU7) is\navailable on RCSB protein databank (Alfaro et al., 2019; Burley et al., 2018; Daoui et\nal., 2019). Our research group has established\nthat noscapine is a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of drug resistant cancers,\nhowever, noscapine was also being used as anti-malarial, anti-stroke and\ncough-suppressant.",

The authors screened designed\nnoscapine and its derivatives against the protease of SARS-CoV-2. In this, the target\nprotease of SARS-CoV-2 for COVID-19 (PDB id - 6LU7) was used to consider in screening\nprotocol (Al-Johani et al., 2017; Chandra et al.,\n2020; Duan & Zhu, 2020). Screening of designed library was done through iGEMDOCK and\nthen screen the hit molecules based on bioactive score and \u2018Lipinski\u2019s Rule of Five\u2019 from\nthe SwissADME and Molinspiration, web servers (Aaboud & ATLAS Collaboration, 2017; Hsu et al., 2011). Based on screening, top hit molecule was taken for molecular docking and MD\nSimulations. Through this, the binding affinity or change in binding free energy of newly\nformed drug\u2013target complex was determined by simulations method and deviations measured on\nincreasing temperature (Aaboud et al., 2018;\nAdasme-Carreno et al., 2014; Athir et al., 2019; Goodsell et al., 2020). Herein, MM-GBSA method was to calculate the change in enthalpy\nand the change in free energy for the formation of complex, number of hydrogen bonds (HBs)\nare determined to study the binding of the hit molecule with the protease of SARS-CoV-2 for\nCOVID-19. A detailed study will provide an understanding to the design of antiviral\nmolecules to inhibit protease of SARS-CoV-2 of COVID-19.",
