Patients with a clinical diagnosis of CB suffer from several changes in the respiratory tract. The airway changes, mostly located in bronchioles, include different degrees of: chronic inflammatory infiltration of the mucosa, mainly due to macrophages and T lymphocytes (CD8); reduction of the number of ciliated cells, as well as of the ciliary length; an hypertrophy of bronchial submucosa glands, as well as of caliciform cells, which in turn leads to an excess of mucus production; and progressive fibrosis of the airway wall, including loss of the elastic fibres that keep bronchioles open [2, 3, 4, 5].",

In developed countries, tobacco smoke is responsible for more than 90% of cases of CB. However, only 15% of heavy smokers will develop a CB. In nearly 20% of them, the disease will not progress. This fact suggests that a particular baseline genetic individual susceptibility is necessary, as shown by the presence of several polymorphisms in genes that codify for inflammatory mediators, proteases or antiproteases [7, 8], by the development of an autoimmune response [9] or perhaps by the presence of chronic viral infection [10, 11, 12] or an infection due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae[13]. The structural and functional changes that develop in patients with CB will lead to nonreversible and slowly progressive obstruction of the bronchial lumen, as well as to a reduction of the effectiveness of the mucocilliary drainage system[14].",

Next, the mucocilliary drainage system carries these microorganisms up to the oropharynx. The process of bacterial clearance from the peripheral airways can last up to 6 h [15]. Over this period, the presence of lactoferrin, lysozyme and secretory leukoproteinase inhibitor, among other antimicrobial compounds from bronchial secretion, hampers the growth of microorganisms [16]. The respiratory airways will be kept sterile whenever two factors, i.e., speed of drainage and bacterial growth inhibitory capacity, are greater than the total amount of microorganisms entering the respiratory tract, taking into account their rate of reproduction. Only those microorganisms (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis) that have specific mechanisms which allow them to stick to the bronchial mucosa epithelial layer, and therefore to avoid being moved up to the oropharynx, will eventually produce an infectious tracheobronchitis in healthy people.",

Bacterial population density is directly related to the degree of impairment of the bronchial drainage system, which in turn correlates well with the severity of airway obstruction. In the initial stages of CB, among those patients with FEV1 values > 60% of those predicted, the culture of bronchial secretions can be \u2018apparently\u2019 sterile (bacterial viable counts below 103 CFU/mL). When the drainage system and/or the obstruction worsens, the probability of being colonised increases [17] and the bacterial density also increases [18, 19, 20]. Any decline in the effectiveness of the drainage system, if lasting long enough, will lead over the following days to a new balance in which bronchial mucus tends to harbour a greater degree of bacterial load. Microorganisms can be kept under very low, even undetectable, numbers in bronchial mucus of patients with stable CB, as confirmed by the fact that, after the sputum culture becomes negative following appropriate antibiotic treatment, the same bacterial phenotype will reappear when clinical relapses of the disease develop [21, 22].",

Toll\u2010like receptors expressed in the epithelium of bronchial mucosa, as well as in macrophages, will recognise specific bacterial components [23]. The activation of nuclear kB factor will start the production of cytokines (interleukins, chemokynes) [24, 25, 26] growth factors [27, 28], intercellular adherence molecules (selectines, ICAM) [29, 30] and arachidonic acid metabolites (B4 leukotriene) [31, 32]. Direct consequences include the development of an inflammatory response, with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) adhering to pulmonary blood vessel endothelium, and migrating into bronchial lumen. The degree of inflammation, as well as the number of PMN cells in the sputum of a CB patient, is directly related to the bacterial density in the bronchial secretion. It has also been noted that a good relationship exists between the gross appearance of the sputum (the greenish color of purulent sputum is due to the presence of leukocyte myeloperoxidase) and the PMN count [33]. A grossly purulent sputum is likely to harbour a high bacterial load in 90% of cases [34].",

The protease activity is rapidly neutralised by specific inhibitors, e.g., alpha\u20101\u2010antitrypsine, alpha\u20101\u2010macroglobulin, elfin, secretory leukoprotease inhibitor, for tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) proteinases and cistatines. ROS can inactivate antiproteases. Free proteases and ROS effects include the enhancement of the inflammatory response, mucus production [37, 38, 39] and the likelihood of lung damage [40, 41] with the ensuing worsening of the airway obstruction (FEV1 reduction) [42, 43, 44, 45], finally leading to emphysema in animal models [46, 47] and very probably also in humans [48].",

On the other hand, when the bacterial counts are high, the purulent appearance of the sputum is related to the higher concentration of proteases, which can then make ineffective the antiprotease neutralising activity. The final result is likely to be worsening of the respiratory tract obstruction, together with an impairment of the mucocilliary drainage system, which in turn maintains (or even increases) the growth of bacteria. In summary, from a given threshold of bacterial load in the bronchial secretion, the degree of inflammatory response may enter a vicious cycle (VC) which can sustain the process [49].

Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a higher degree of inflammation than that produced by Haemophilus influenzae, which in turn is higher than that due to Moraxella catarrhalis or Haemophilus parainfluenzae[50, 51]. Overall, the critical density of bacteria in bronchial mucus that leads to the VC lies around \u2265 106 CFU/mL. Chronic production of purulent sputum has been linked with an impairment of FEV1[52], as well as with a higher risk of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations requiring hospitalisation [53, 54]. Acute exacerbations of CB are associated with the presence of higher bacterial loads in the bronchial mucus [19].",

            "text": "The clinical evolution of patients with CB is characterised by the regular appearance of worsening episodes of bronchial inflammation, due to bacterial or viral infection in more than 60% of cases [55, 56]. The remaining episodes are due to environmental factors (air pollution, dust, temperature), lack of compliance with baseline treatment or development of cardiac disrythmias, among other infrequently encountered causes. Viral infection is mainly due to rhinovirus [11,12 57] followed by coronavirus, respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), influenza and parainfluenza virus and adenovirus [58]. Recently, it has been demonstrated that human metapneumovirus can play a role in acute exacerbations of CB in up to a 4% of cases [59]. Bacterial infection can be due to the acquisition of a new H. influenzae strain [60, 61, 62, 63] or, less frequently, of a M. catarrhalis[64] strain, very probably showing higher virulence when compared with those strains that have been present before in bronchial mucus [65]. Surface antigenic protein genes of H. influenzae can mutate, allowing the microorganisms to escape from immune response [66, 67], a property that perhaps could explain some of the exacerbations. Several studies [68, 69, 70] demonstrate serological evidence for acute C. pneumoniae infection in up to a 5% of CB exacerbations, an observation that was not confirmed by other authors [71].",

Even when the initial trigger of the acute exacerbation episode is not a bacterial infection, there is an enhanced risk that, over the next few days, bacteria will participate actively in the process and determine its final evolution when the density threshold level for generating the VC is reached. The likelihood of this series of events depends on two main factors: the severity and duration of the triggering cause and the baseline situation of the CB patient. The greater the bacterial charge at the baseline, the greater the risk that any given phenomenon, independently of its aetiology, will contribute to the bronchial inflammation and lead to exacerbation due to an even higher bacterial load (Fig. 2). Higher bacterial loads under stable clinical conditions are often seen among CB patients with a history of repeated acute exacerbations [72] and/or moderate to severe degrees of bronchial obstruction. The rate of acute exacerbation is higher in patients at more advanced stages of CB as measured by the degree of bronchial obstruction [73, 74, 75]. In a significant proportion of patients with acute exacerbation of CB, the recovery is incomplete [76].",

Other bacteria found less frequently include Staphylococcus aureus and H. parainfluenzae. The presence of GNB is due, to a great extent, to the higher rate of antibiotic usage as treatment for acute exacerbations among patients with moderate or severe CB.

All FQ except ciprofloxacin have been used in 5\u2010day treatment courses against 7\u201310 day treatment courses for the comparator antibiotics. Most studies include CB patients with type I or type II acute exacerbations, as determined by Anthonisen's study criteria [90]. The clinical response, assessed at days 7\u201321 after treatment was deemed to be favourable in 80\u201390% of cases. None of the studies showed statistically significant differences between treatment arms. Bacterial elimination rates ranged from 60 to 98%. In four of the 14 studies, the sputum culture become negative in a significantly higher percentage of patients treated with a FQ when compared with any other antibiotic used [120, 121, 130, 133]. Several studies conducted by Chodosh [120] and Wilson [127], where the time interval from the end of antibiotic treatment to the next acute exacerbation episode was analysed, demonstrate that the interval free of disease was significantly longer in the group of patients treated with FQ. Besides the advantages evident from these results, which include a better quality of life for patients and lower cost of illness, a reduction in the number of acute exacerbation episodes implies a better preservation of antibiotic susceptibility due to its lesser usage, but also a slowing in the rate of damage to the patient's respiratory function, which several other studies linked to the annual number of acute exacerbations [43].",

This could be explained by the fact that not only must the following exacerbation episode start from lower bacterial load counts, but more probably by the improvement of inflammation related to a lower bacterial load, because patients with persistent colonisation show greater degrees of inflammation throughout their periods of clinical stability [134].",

Nearly 1% of patients under FQ treatment will develop arthralgia and, very infrequently, Achilles' tendon injury, including a risk of tendon rupture. This untoward effect is more likely to develop in patients with chronic renal failure and/or patients treated with steroid drugs [135]. The median duration of FQ treatment before the onset of tendon injury was 8 days [135]. The prolonged QT interval was the main factor for the market withdrawal of sparfloxacin and grepafloxacin. In healthy volunteers, a 1000 mg dose of levofloxacin and a 1500 mg dose of ciprofloxacin induce a 4 ms prolongation of the QT interval. In the same study, a dose of 800 mg of moxifloxacin resulted in a 16 ms QT prolongation [136]. The risk of cardiac dysrhythmias (torsades de pointes) is very low, but could be increased if the patient has hypokaliemia, has a major cardiac disease or is taking several antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, quinidine, procainamide, sotalol), tricyclic antidepressants or other antipsychotic drug treatment, which also lead to QT prolongation.

For this reason, mineral dietary supplements, antacid compounds and sucralfate can significantly reduce FQ absorption if the antibiotic is not taken at least 4 h before or 2 h after. Ciprofloxacin can increase the plasma levels of theophylline because of its inhibition of P\u2010450 cytochrome. The effect of levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin on theophylline metabolism is minimal. Gatifloxacin can interact with oral hypoglycemic agents, and induce hypoglycemia [137].",

FQ have the additional advantage that a single daily oral dose, used over a 5\u2010day treatment course, is usually enough. A greater efficacy of FQ antibiotics in reducing bacterial load, as well as the likely implications of this effect on the duration of the interval free of exacerbations, together with a slowing of the rate of functional impairment, justify the consideration of FQ as the first\u2010choice antibiotic treatment, notably in those patients with moderate to severe CB (FEV1 < 60%), age above 65 years or comorbid conditions (diabetes, cardiac disease, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic renal failure). In patients with mild CB (FEV1 \u2265 60%), aged below 65 years and without comorbidity, FQ antibiotics are an option for treatment as are amoxycillin\u2010clavulanate or telithromycin (used in those areas with high resistance rates to macrolides among pneumococci). It is prudent to state clearly this difference, in order to avoid a widespread use of FQ for all CB acute exacerbation episodes that warrant treatment, and to reduce the likelihood of resistance development. CB patients with a prior history of more than four acute exacerbation episodes requiring antibiotic treatment over a 1\u2010year period have a high risk for P. aeruginosa colonisation. In those cases, it is recommended that a sputum sample for culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing always be obtained, because the P. aeruginosa resistance rate to FQ in some areas is high [138]. Until the results become available, if oral antibiotic treatment is considered, ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin should be used.",
