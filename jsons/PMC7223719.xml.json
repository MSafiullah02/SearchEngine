These evidences suggest that LUS has the potential to improve clinical skills of medical students at the bedside. However, despite the diffusion of LUS in the clinical practice, there are no clear evidence-based guidelines on LUS education: in fact, a recent review demonstrates the extreme heterogeneity of current education studies in terms of setup, teaching methods, and assessment of competencies [12]. For the assessment of theoretical knowledge, educators usually rely on ad-hoc multiple-choice questionnaires or open questions, often administered as before\u2013after tests, a setup that suffers from minimal internal and external validity and considered obsolete. Instead, for practical skills\u2019 assessment, various checklists have been proposed, none of which has undergone a validation process [12]. Hence, there is a need of a standardized approach for the assessment of LUS skills. In this regard, a recently validated tool, i.e., the objective structured assessment of lung-ultrasound skills (LUS-OSAUS), has the potential to overcome all the above limitations. This tool consists of 17 items grouped into six areas of competencies, selected through a Delphi consensus and then underwent construct validity [13]. In our study, we used the LUS-OSAUS to assess the competencies of a group of LUS-trained undergraduates from the University of Pavia.",

During that previous experience, students had received theoretical teaching on the basic principles of ultrasonography, with a focus on the utility and limitations of inferior vena cava sonographic evaluation, as a surrogate of central venous pressure measurement. Moreover, they had been taught the technical skills for subxiphoid inferior vena cava visualization and measurement of the caval index, which they performed on real patients using the hand-held sonographic device Vscan\u2122, GE Vingmed Ultrasound AS, Horten, Norway.",

Initially, students attended a 3-h didactic lecture, which also included a hands-on session. The didactic lecture was hold by two senior residents in emergency medicine (EM) who practice LUS on a daily basis (MM, SDP), and by a consultant in internal medicine with certified ultrasound expertise in lung ultrasonography (TP). Following the theoretical training, students attended the San Matteo University Hospital, where they performed ten supervised LUS examinations on patients hospitalized in the Internal Medicine ward. Among all patients, we selected those who referred respiratory symptoms at admission, both as main or secondary complaint. The first 80 eligible patients accepting to take part to the study were enrolled as a convenience sample. Tutoring during the practical training was provided by the two same residents involved in theoretical teaching (MM, SDP). Once completed their training (i.e., after completing ten sonographic examinations of the lung), students were tested for their competencies: they were asked to perform an LUS examination on a patient hospitalized for respiratory symptoms. For this purpose, an additional sample of eight patients (one for each student) was enrolled. The same eight patients were also scanned by a more expert operator, an EM resident (SDP), for a comparison with student\u2019s results. Performances of students and senior resident were assessed by a consultant in Internal Medicine with years of experience in LUS (FF), who adopted the LUS-OSAUS scale and measured the time needed to complete each scan. The examiner was only responsible of students\u2019 evaluation and had no role in their training. All participants involved in the study, including patients, students, and physicians, provided written informed consent.",

All the operators (students and resident) were allowed to use only the B-mode setting; therefore, M-mode evaluation of the pleural sliding was not requested. When scanning a patient, operators were taught to divide each hemithorax in four quadrants, as described in the current international recommendations for point-of-care lung ultrasound [15]. In case of detection of pleural effusion, students were also instructed to move patients to the sitting position, and to scan it from the posterior costophrenic angle upwards: this allows a more accurate estimation of the effusion and a more reliable assessment of whether a thoracentesis would be safe or not (item 13\u201314 of scale; Table 1).",

The video was specifically created for the purpose of this study, and it reviews all topics covered in the classroom and at the bedside (see Supplementary Material).

Four weeks after their practical training, they returned to the same ward to undertake the test with the modalities discussed above.

As expected, student\u2019s median times to complete the scan (14.1 [12.8\u201316.1]) min were in line with those of the intermediate group of the study (mean 16.4 min [95% CI, 8.9\u201323.9; p = 0.005]) [13], whereas their scores were slightly higher compared to that group. In this regard, it would be hazardous and possibly wrong to conclude that our students were more expert than the intermediate group of the validation study. The operators of the intermediate group were residents of various medical specialties in different years of training; however, the author does not specify what kind of education they had received in lung ultrasound. It is likely that this group had a quite heterogeneous background of LUS competencies and possibly some residents lacking a formal and structured training in lung ultrasound may have scored relatively low when they were assessed with the LUS-OSAUS. On the contrary, our student\u2019s group was very homogeneous in terms of preliminary competencies (same year of training; same background in ultrasound), and most importantly, they received an LUS training that was \u201cLUS-OSAUS-oriented\u201d, i.e., they were specifically trained both in the classroom and at the bedside to master each item of the scale. This can help to explain why they scored higher than the intermediate group of the validation study, which was the level that we expected they would reach at the end of our training.",

For this reason, we developed an educational video that reviews all the fundamental aspects of lung ultrasound, which could be consulted anytime by our students. Based on our teaching experience, a \u201ctips and tricks\u201d section has also been included in the video, to highlight what the most common technical mistakes of novices are and to suggest how to avoid them. Although we did not specifically measure the efficacy of the video, this tool has been very much appreciated by our trainees, and we believe that it can be beneficial to all practitioners who are approaching to lung ultrasound and to their educators.

We believe that the adoption of this tool in future studies will probably make less and less common the use of ad-hoc multiple-choice questionnaires, often administered as before-after test [12]. Nevertheless, we also noted some weak points of the LUS-OSAUS. For instance, the item \u201ccorrect assessment of pleura\u201d does not specify exactly what skills the trainee should master; in our case, this was limited to B-mode visual evaluation of sliding/bat sign, lung pulse, and appearance of the pleura (regular vs irregular; thin vs thickened). However, other potential LUS trainees, such as ICU residents, would probably be requested to provide other information when assessing the pleura, such as a detailed description of aerated vs non-aerated areas of the lungs in a mechanically ventilated patient. The integration of LUS with clinical findings and conclusions will also differ according to trainees: for instance, the hypothetical ICU resident describing non-aerated lung bases in his mechanically ventilated patient will integrate this finding with the ventilator setting, for example concluding that the PEEP values should be modified and LUS repeated afterwards.",

For example, to standardize and simplify trainee\u2019s learning process, we restricted the use of probes to the convex one. However, students knew from their theoretical training all the advantages and disadvantages of linear and microconvex probes, which they were asked to discuss during their examination (evaluation of item 6 of LUS-OSAUS scale; see Table 1). In our opinion, an appropriate LUS training for students should include the minimum number of skills that can actually make a difference in their clinical performances at the bedside. Educators should consider that medical curricula are already very demanding, and a too much technical LUS course carries the potential risk of generating confusion rather than supporting clinical reasoning.",
