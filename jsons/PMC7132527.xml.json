Because searching, organizing, and sharing information has never been easier, authors of medical and scientific articles have been incorporating Internet references to support material in their publications.6, 7 Approximately 3% of all references within recently published scientific and medical journals are Internet references.6, 7 In our own experience retrieving Internet references, we found that many of them were no longer active or no longer contained the material originally referenced in the article. Using Internet references within published articles becomes problematic for the readers of scientific and medical journals if the supporting material for factual statements disappears. This problem has been identified in high-impact-factor journals such as Journal of the American Medical Association, Science, and New England Journal of Medicine.7, 8, 9\nEditor\u2019s Capsule Summary\nWhat is already known on this topic\nWith increasing frequency, scientific articles cite Internet materials in their reference section. The cited sites may not be stable.\nWhat question this study addressed\nHow often are Internet sites cited in Annals of Emergency Medicine, and do they remain accessible?\nWhat this study adds to our knowledge\nLess than one quarter of Web sites cited in 2000 articles and less than half of Web sites cited in 2005 articles were accessible in 2006.\nHow this might change clinical practice\nUnlike references to printed material, references to Internet material are unstable and decay over time. In light of this evidence, journals should consider requiring that all Internet references be made through WebCite or other free, permanent archival services.",

For example, a URL that links to the New York Times Web site will be active, but the information the authors intended to cite will no longer be on the home page. Because the main purpose of the study was to evaluate the accessibility of referenced information on the Internet, we thought that classifying these URLs as active sites was inappropriate. In an attempt to locate the authors\u2019 intended information, we used the site-specific search engine. Phrases that represented the authors\u2019 intended information as published were then entered into the data spreadsheet. We used the copy and paste functions to transfer the text directly from the \u201cintended information\u201d column in the spreadsheet to the site-specific search bar on the Web site. The first 10 results produced by each search were reviewed, and the Internet references were then categorized according to the results of these individual searches. If the authors\u2019 intended information was found, the Internet reference was classified in the \u201creference found with the site search\u201d category.

Difficulty in determining whether the Internet reference linked to the authors\u2019 intended Web site could have led us to misclassify some of the references. We provide all 586 of the Internet references on the Web version of this article (Appendix E1, available online at http://www.annemergmed.com) to allow the reader the opportunity to identify such misclassifications. Although we attempted to access the Internet references that were not active or temporarily unavailable at 2 points, it is conceivable that additional attempts to access those URLs would have changed the classification of those Internet references. We had no method for systematically identifying typographic errors within the published Internet references. Correcting typographic errors might change the classification of some Internet references.

Of these inaccessible Internet references, 55% could not link to an active Web site, and 37% would link to a generic but related Web site that did not contain the authors\u2019 intended information. During our attempts at accessing these Internet references, we often could not decide whether we were viewing the material the authors had viewed when writing the article. A central function of references is to provide support for statements put forward by an author. If a reader questions a fact, he or she can go to the supporting reference and review that information. Traditionally, if a journal article is cited in a reference section, that journal can be accessed and the reader can be confident that the article he or she is reading was the exact article that the author intended to cite. The reader may then participate in a dialogue with the author by challenging his interpretation of the data presented in the reference. If this dialogue is held in a public forum such as in a letter to the editor, the readers may benefit from a deeper insight into the topic at hand. Authors are held to a high degree of accountability for the factual statements they make and reference. If the supporting material in a reference disappears or changes over time, components of a meaningful dialogue and author accountability are damaged.",

Because of the convenience of the Internet, authors are recognizing the value of the Internet as a resource. If the use of Internet references continues to increase, the problems associated with inaccessible information will increase also.",

Published reports have suggested that the author or publisher keep a digital or hard copy of the information contained within an Internet reference.8, 9, 11, 12 These solutions are not intuitively appealing because authors may become unavailable and publishers may go out of business. Now that the technology exists to digitally archive information, a better solution available to authors and publishers is the archiving of Internet references. The 2 archiving systems that are available are Internet Archive (available at http://www.archive.org) and WebCite (available at http://www.webcitation.org).9, 10, 11, 12\n",

Last, WebCite has formed partnerships with libraries and preservation consortia that have legally agreed to support the service to ensure long-term availability to authors, readers, and publishers.10\n",
