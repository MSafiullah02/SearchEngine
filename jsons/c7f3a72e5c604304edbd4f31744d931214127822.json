            "text": "Purpose Children with Down's syndrome (DS) are prone to respiratory tract infections (RTIs) due to anatomical variation, immune system immaturity and comorbidities. However, evidence on RTI-related healthcare utilisation, especially in primary care, is incomplete. In this retrospective cohort study, we use routinely collected primary and secondary care data to quantify RTI-related healthcare utilisation in children with DS and matched controls without DS. Methods Retrospective cohort study of 992 children with DS and 4874 matched controls attending English general practices and hospitals as identified in Clinical disease research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records (CALIBER) from 1997 to 2010. Poisson regression was used to calculate consultation, hospitalisation and prescription rates, and rate ratios. Wald test was used to compare risk of admission following consultation. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare length of stay by RTI type and time-to-hospitalisation. Results RTI-related healthcare utilisation is significantly higher in children with DS than in controls in terms of GP consultations (adjusted RR 1.73; 95% CI 1.62-1.84), hospitalisations (adjusted RR 5.70; 95% CI 4.82-6.73), and antibiotic prescribing (adjusted RR 2.34; 95% CI 2.19-2.49). Two percent of children with DS presenting for an RTI-related GP consultation were subsequently admitted for an RTI-related hospitalisation, compared to 0.7% in controls. Conclusions Children with DS have higher rates of GP consultations, hospitalisations and antibiotic prescribing compared to controls. This poses a significant burden on families. Further research is recommended to characterise healthcare behaviours and clinical decision-making, to optimise care for this at risk group.",

By relying on READ and ICD-10 codes for diagnoses, this study may be subject to misclassification bias. It is known that considerable inter-practice variation exists in coding certain conditions such as RTIs. For example, READ or ICD-10 codes for \"respiratory tract infection\" could be either an URTI or LRTI. We aimed to address this by separately considering unclassified RTI types, but misclassification bias may remain. Misclassification may particularly be present for asthma, which is not typically diagnosed in the under 5s in the UK. Individual episodes could have been missed through non-recording by GPs, or use of free text entries, although it is unknown whether this would differ between children with DS and controls. An additional proportion of medically attended RTIs in both children with DS and controls will be missed, as RTIs are seen not only by GPs but also at other ambulatory care centres (i.e. urgent care centres, outof-hours GP) and A&E. Finally, and importantly, research has noted that most RTIs do not lead to a GP consultation [18] . There is little qualitative evidence on healthcare seeking behaviour in families of children with DS, and whether this varies from other patient groups. Until such evidence can be gathered, we cannot know whether the data partially reflects a difference in propensity to consult when children with DS and controls have RTIs, rather than a true difference in RTI incidence.",

Morphological and functional anomalies of the airway causing (partial) obstruction, particularly midfacial hypoplasia and airway malacia [19] , alongside immunological variations including reduced leukocytes, particularly T-and B-cell subpopulations [20] [21] [22] [23] , increase susceptibility to and severity of respiratory infections. Increased admissions may also be due to uncertainty regarding speed of deterioration or oxygen requirements, and many admissions may be precautionary, also reflected by the higher prescribing rates in children with DS. In this context, parents have reported that some doctors seem 'afraid' of children with DS [24] . It will be important to identify whether the high rates of admission are related to severity of the infection, time at presentation, time and type of antibiotics prescribed, or other factors. Further research should determine why more than 70% of RTI-related hospitalisations were not preceded by a recorded GP consultation as this may represent an opportunity to avert admission through timely community-based treatment. Regional analyses may be helpful, comparing Clinical Commissioning Groups with high and low rates of RTI-related health utilisation, to highlight areas of best practice and whether local community initiatives exist that can avert unnecessary attendances.",

It may be that those at risk of RTI-related hospitalisation could be defined in greater detail, thus enabling the development of a symptom-based scoring algorithm modelled on algorithms that already exist for many other conditions [11, 25, 26] . However, symptoms are not well recorded in routine records. Although not explored by this study, further research may also want to examine prescribing rates for antivirals for influenza in children with DS. These are rarely prescribed for children without DS, despite recommendations to do so [27, 28] . Regarding public health recommendations, this study lends weight to the recommendation by the Down's Syndrome Medical Interest Group that children with DS should be considered for annual influenza vaccination at all ages [29] , particularly in infancy.",
