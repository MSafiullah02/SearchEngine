Host defense against viral infection is mediated by the effector mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is the initial response to prevent, control, or eliminate viral infection and stimulates and influences the types of adaptive immune responses that develop (Akira et al., 2006). Natural killer (NK) cells, the first and best described innate lymphoid cells, play important roles in innate immune responses. The effector functions of NK cells are to kill infected cells and to produce interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3). NK cells may also be important later in the course of viral infection by killing infected cells that have escaped cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune attack by reducing expression of class I MHC molecules (Lam and Lanier, 2017). Adaptive immunity against viral infection is mediated by antibodies, which block virus binding and entry into host cells, and by CD8+ CTLs, which eliminate the infection by killing infected cells (Lu et al., 2018). The functions of CD4+ effector T cells are to recruit and activate phagocytes that destroy intracellular viruses and to help B lymphocytes to produce antibodies (Pepper and Jenkins, 2011).",

Pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs of the disease such as diarrhea, vomiting and anorexia until necropsy. Appearance and consistency of feces were recorded and assigned to a score as follows: 0 = normal; 1 = mild fluidic feces; 2 = moderate watery feces; 3 = severe watery and projectile diarrhea, with scores of 1 or more considered diarrheic.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea is an acute viral enteric infection that results in high mortality and morbidity in suckling pigs (Jung and Saif, 2015). The fecal-oral route is the main route of PEDV transmission (Crawford et al., 2015), and airborne transmission is also considered a potential route for PEDV dissemination (Alonso et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018). Therefore, induction of localized immune responses at these mucosal sites is important in preventing disease (Neutra and Kozlowski, 2006). Several studies have shown that the degree of protection against various viral infections correlates better with the level of secretory than with serum antibodies (Gould et al., 2017; Habibi et al., 2015). Intramuscular injection is the most common route used in vaccination. However, this route usually does not induce immune response in the external secretions that bathe the mucosal membranes, the most common sites of entry of infectious agents. A more effective route that results in a generalized immune response manifested by the parallel appearance of specific antibodies in several external secretions, involves ingestion or inhalation of antigens.",

It has been shown that a serial passage of PEDV and other coronaviruses often results in growth adaptation in vitro and attenuation of virus virulence (Chen et al., 2015; Huo et al., 2016; Kweon et al., 1999). In our study, the 120th passage virus were cell-culture adapted compared to the earlier passages, and the viral titers of the 16th, 35th and 120th passage virus were continuously increasing. The nucleotide and amino acid changes of P120 may contribute to the cell culture adaption of the strain. In the virulence experiment, the 16th-passaged virus caused watery diarrhea and high mortality rate in pigs, while the P120-infected pigs showed only mild diarrhea and recovered in a few days. There were no gross lesions evident in any PEDV-inoculated pigs. These results indicated that the 120th-passaged virus was attenuated. In orally inoculated piglets, three piglets showed mild signs of diarrhea in two or three days after inoculation, and the signs seemed to be transient. The diarrhea coincided with the viral load in the feces, and orally infected pigs continued to shed virus for the next few days. All intranasally exposed piglets shed mild fluidic feces starting at 2 dpi, the syndrome lasted for 2 days and all piglets recovered in the next 2\u20133 days. The viral load peaked at 3 dpi and became undetectable in I.N. group. We observed about one day delay in viral shedding and onset of diarrhea in I.N. inoculated group as compared with the orally inoculated group. This is in general agreement with a recent paper (Li et al., 2018), which showed that PEDV could cause typical diarrhea in piglets through a nasal spray and illustrated the mechanism of its transport from the entry site via systemic route by T cells carrying the viral pathogen to the intestines where the infection occurs. In their model, the intranasally inoculated piglets began to exhibit typical PEDV symptoms at 60 hpi, about 14 h later than orally inoculated piglets. They detected viral RNA in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum at 24 hpi, but not before (3 or 12 hpi) in intranasally inoculated piglets. This delay represents the time required by the host cells to transfer the virus to the intestines through the blood circulation. In intramuscularly infected group, however, the diarrhea lasted for 4 days. It is interesting that fecal viral RNA copies were undetectable, so the diarrhea may partly be attributed to the stress caused by injection.",

In our study, IgA antibodies in feces and jejunum were almost undetected in intranasally inoculated pigs. In accordance with the profiles of antibodies secreted in serum and feces, the jejunal contents of orally inoculated pigs showed remarkable increased IgA antibodies at 21 dpi. It has been reported that IgA presented in the intestine is related to the protection against gastroenteric infections (Blutt and Conner, 2013; Blutt et al., 2012). IgA and IgG antibodies in gut associated lymphoid tissues and blood were positively correlated with protection against PEDV challenge 21 day after the first infection (De Arriba et al., 2002).

IL-10 is an inhibitor of activated macrophages and dendritic cells and is thus involved in control of innate immune reactions and cell-mediated immunity. IL-10 can inhibit the production of many cytokines including interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-12. IL-12 is secreted by dendritic cells and macrophages and stimulates IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells and T cells, enhances NK cell and CTL-mediated cytotoxicity (Saraiva and O'garra, 2010). Both serum IL-10 and IL-12 levels were elevated in orally inoculated pig and the pattern of production was similar, peaking at 7dpi and declining thereafter. The fold-change of IL-10 level was drastic. A study showed that IL-10 secretion did not change in both CV-777 infected immature and mature dendritic cells in vitro, while IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 secretions were significantly induced (Gao et al., 2015). The discrepancy may be due to the different strains and experimental conditions. Given the fact that IL-10 can decrease anti-viral associated IFN-\u03b3 production, it is possible that the secretion of IL-10 could have substantially diminished the ability of the cells spontaneously secreting IFN-\u03b3 to mediate protective immunity against the virus.",

These results corroborated the previous study showing that the PEDV-infected suckling pigs had no detectable NK cell activity in blood mononuclear cells at 1 and 5 dpi (Annamalai et al., 2015). At 14 dpi, control pigs showed detectable activity of NK cells in blood PBLs. Orally, I.N., or I.M. inoculated suckling pigs had lower NK cell activities compared to the control group with no statistical difference despite NK cell frequencies were significantly reduced.",
