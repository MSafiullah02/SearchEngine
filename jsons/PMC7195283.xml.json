Other than diabetes, most of the factors identified in the literature for deterioration were inconsistent with our patient. A lymphocyte count below 1500 \u03bcL has been identified as a factor but was normal in our patient [6]. One multicenter study of 78 admitted patients with COVID-19 pneumonia found that the 14% who deteriorated were older, more likely to be smokers and equally likely to have diabetes compared to those who improved [7]. Two of the aforementioned studies [5,7] also noted elevated temperature at admission to be associated with deterioration; while our patient had a history of subjective fevers, his temperature on presentation was normal. Older age was found to be a risk factor for ARDS and death in a single-center study of 201 patients [8]. A possible association between Chest CT findings and severe COVID-19, suggested in a study of 104 patients aboard the \u201cDiamond Princess\u201d cruise ship [9], is discussed below.",
