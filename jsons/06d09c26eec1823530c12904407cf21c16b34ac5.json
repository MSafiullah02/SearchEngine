Methods: In total, 348 CT scans in 112 patients were classified according to the time after the onset of the initial symptoms, namely stage-1 (0-4 days); stage-2 (5-9 days); stage-3 (10-14 days); stage-4 (15-21 days); stage-5 (22-28 days); and stage-6 (\uff1e28 days). Each lung lobe was evaluated for extent affected by ground-glass opacities (GGO), crazy-paving pattern and consolidation, in five categories of percentual severity. Summation of scores from all five lung lobes provided the total CT score (maximal CT score, 25). Results: The predominant patterns of lung abnormalities were GGOs, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities. The frequency of crazy-paving pattern, consolidation and linear opacities peaked at stage-3 (62.7 %), stage-4 (75.0 %) and stage-5 (83.1 %), respectively, and decreased thereafter. Total CT scores increased from stage-1 to stage-2 (2.8 \u00b1 3.1, vs. 6.5 \u00b1 4.6, respectively, P < 0.01), and thereafter remained high. The lower lobes were more inclined to be involved with higher CT scores except for stage-1. At stage-6 98.1 % of CT scans still showed abnormalities (CT score 7.5 \u00b1 4.1). Conclusion: Thin-section CT could provide semi-quantitative analysis of pulmonary damage severity.

The pathogen was soon identified as a coronavirus, similar to those involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The novel coronavirus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ICTV), capable of infecting humans, on 11 February 2020 and the disease was termed COVID-19 by world health organization (WHO) [1] . Based on the current epidemiological surveys, the incubation period of this disease is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days. Fever, dry cough and fatigue are the main manifestations. A few patients have symptoms such as nasal obstruction, runny nose, sore throat, myalgia and diarrhea. Seriously ill patients may rapidly progress to ARDS. The outbreak of COVID-19 has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by WHO. As of March 18, 2020, a total of 186,777 confirmed cases with COVID-19 pneumonia have been reported globally, including 7480 deaths (4.0 %). A specific viral nucleic acid assay using real time reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was quickly developed to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 [2, 3] . However, from the recently published literature, some patients with likely 2019-nCoV infection might have initial negative RT-PCR results [4] . Reasons for false negative RT-PCR tests may include insufficient cellular material for detection and improper extraction of nucleic acid from clinical materials [5, 6] . According to current experience, lung CT imaging may manifest abnormalities earlier than RT-PCR testing.
