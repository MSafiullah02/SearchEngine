However, it is unknown whether Carbenoxolone disodium (CBX), one of the GNa derivatives, affects DENV infection. Here, we found that the production of infectious DENV particles was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in DENV-permissive cells, while the viral RNA and viral protein synthesis were not affected. Moreover, results from time-of-addition study showed that the inhibitory effect of CBX on DENV was exhibited by targeting the virus itself, not the host cells. Directly incubating DENV with CBX resulted in a remarkable reduction of virus titer and virus infectivity. Furthermore, DENV RNA from progeny virions in the supernatants was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate that the antiviral activity of CBX against DENV may be mainly due to a virucidal effect exerted by the compound itself. Our work, for the first time, demonstrates that CBX has antiviral activity against DENV infection, providing useful information for development of potential therapeutic interventions against dengue.",

Currently, it is estimated that over 50 million cases of dengue infection occur annually, which have swept through more than 100 countries, with potential for further spread [Simmons et al., 2012] . From September to December 2014, an unexpected large outbreak of dengue infection with a significant proportion of severe cases was reported in Pearl River Delta of Guangdong Province, China. It has been the most severe dengue epidemic over the years, with more than 40,000 cases was diagnosed, including five deaths (http://www.cdcp.org.cn). The emergence of the unprecedented magnitude of dengue outbreak has aroused widespread social concern. In this situation, the WHO considers the development of an effective dengue vaccine to be a high priority. Due to great endeavor of scientific researchers from around the world, Dengvaxia (Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, Rh) has become the first licensed vaccine available to prevent DF. However, for now there is no available antiviral agent approving for combating DENV [Idrees and Ashfaq, 2012] . Therefore, under current circumstance, the pressing task is to develop safe and effective antiviral drugs against dengue.",

For example, triterpenic compounds, such as glycyrrhizic acid (GRa), glycyrrhetinic acid (GNa), and some of their derivatives have been demonstrated to block the replication of a broad spectrum of viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SARS related coronavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, flaviviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), hepatitis B and C virus, influenza virus, rotavirus, adenovirus, etc. [Dargan et al., 1992a,b; Takahara et al., 1994; Matsuo et al., 2001; Cinatl et al., 2003; Crance et al., 2003; Lin, 2003; Orlent et al., 2006; Cos et al., 2008; Ashfaq et al., 2011; Hardy et al., 2012; Smirnov et al., 2012] . Carbenoxolone disodium (CBX), one of the GNa derivatives, is similar to substances found in the root of licorice plant. With a steroid-like structure, CBX has been clinically applied in the treatment of gastric ulcers and other types of inflammation [Connors, 2012] . Besides, CBX is best known in cellular physiology as an effective, water-soluble blocker of gap junctions [Rozental et al., 2001] . In earlier studies, CBX was reported to exhibit complex activities against herpes simplex virus (HSV), including synthesis, processing, and transportation of viral gene products Subak-Sharpe, 1985, 1986; Dargan et al., 1988] . Nonetheless, whether CBX has an inhibitory effect on DENV remains unknown.",

Cytotoxicity of CBX was first determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method in A549 cells, one of the dengue-permissive cells, to establish suitable dosages for further studies. As shown in Figure 1b , cell viability was close to control in treatments with 10, 25, 50, and 100 mM CBX, whereas only 80% cells survived in the presence of 200 mM CBX. Therefore, CBX concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mM were considered for the following assay. To examine the effect of CBX on DENV infection, A549 cells were infected with DENV-1 Hawaii strain and DENV-2 New Guinea C strain, respectively, and incubated for 24 hr in the presence or absence of CBX. As shown in Figure 1c and d, the production of infectious DENV particles was significantly decreased by CBX treatment in a dose-dependent manner. At concentrations of 50 and 100 mM, CBX treatment led to 500-and 1500-fold reduction of DENV-1 titer, respectively (Fig. 1c) . Likewise, at 25, 50, and 100 mM CBX, around 20-, 2000-, and 5000-fold lower levels of DENV-2 titer were observed than control, respectively (Fig. 1d) . Taken together, these results suggest that CBX has a dose-dependent inhibition effect on progeny DENV production in A549 cells, and the anti-DENV effect of CBX is not limited to a specific DENV serotype.",

Starting at 1 hr prior to DENV infection (pre-treatment); 0 hr concurrently with viral infection till 24 hr post-infection (post-treatment); from 1 hr prior to viral infection till 24 hr post-infection (continuous-treatment), or till 16 hr post-infection (short-treatment). Cell supernatants were harvested for TCID 50 assay. As shown in Figure 4b , both posttreatment and continuous-treatment of cells by CBX led to approximately 3000-fold reduction of progeny virus titer. By contrast, pre-treatment with CBX did not have a significant impact on DENV-2 yields (Fig. 4b) . As CBX can freely shuttle into cytoplasm by all three treatments mentioned above [Parke, 1983; Connors, 2012] , this result indicates that the inhibitory effect of CBX on DENV is not exhibited by targeting the host cells. When eliminating CBX from the media at 16 hr post-infection (short-treatment), the titer of progeny DENV-2 particles also was not affected (Fig. 4b) . In our DENV-2-infected system, newly formed virions began to secret from A549 cells at 16 hr post-infection (data not shown). So at this point, short-treatment as mentioned can prevent progeny virions from contacting with CBX. Therefore, these results from time-of-addition study suggest that CBX inhibits DENV by directly targeting the infectious virions extracellularly. ",

As shown in Figure 5a , DENV-1 titer was significantly decreased by 10-and 1500-fold when incubated with 50 or 100 mM CBX, respectively, but not with 25 mM CBX. When DENV-1 suspensions were incubated with 50 or 100 mM CBX for 1, 6, and 12 hr, respectively, virus titer at each time point was significantly decreased (Fig. 5b) . Likewise, CBX exhibited a similar behavior on DENV-2. As shown in Figure 5c , treating DENV-2 suspensions with 25, 50, and 100 mM CBX resulted in 10-, 80-, and 1000-fold reduction of virus titer, respectively. Moreover, longer incubation of CBX correspondingly led to a lower titer of residue DENV-2, peaking at 12 hr incubation (Fig. 5d) . Surprisingly, the titer of DENV-2 was almost undetectable when incubating with 100 mM CBX for 12 hr (Fig. 5d) . Taken together, these data indicate that incubation with CBX effectively decreases DENV titer in a dose-and timedependent manner. Furthermore, we directly incubated DENV-2 with 100 mM CBX at 37\u02daC for 1 hr, and then followed by an infection in A549 cells for indicated time. The viral RNA synthesis, viral protein expression and progeny virus production were compared as indicated above. As shown in Figure 6a , the levels of viral RNA at 12 and 24 hr were barely detected in cells infected with CBX-incubated DENV-2. While in control cells, viral RNA synthesis was gradually increased post infection (Fig. 6a) . Immunofluorescence microscopy images showed that no or just few cells were positively stained with DENV prM glycoprotein antibody in CBX-incubating group, compared to approximate 52% of control cells were positively stained at 24 hr post DENV-2 infection (Fig. 6b and c) . Likewise, the production of progeny virions from -1 (a and b) or DENV-2 (c and d) was directly incubated with indicated concentrations of CBX for 6 hr (a and c) or for indicated time (b and d) at 37\u02daC. The titer of residual virus was determined by TCID 50 assay. Data are shown as mean AE SEM of at least three independent experiments. \u00c3\u00c3 P < 0.01; \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 P < 0.001.

Quantitative RT-PCR result showed that DENV-2 viral RNA synthesis was significantly decreased by 50% in CBX-treated group (Fig. 7b) . Similarly, result from immunofluorescence assay showed that CBX treatment led to effective reduction of viral protein expression (Fig. 7c) .

Time-of-addition experiment was also performed to narrow down the effective period of this compound. It is reported that CBX can freely shuttle into cytoplasm [Parke, 1983; Connors, 2012] . However, progeny DENV-2 was inhibited only when CBX was added after virus attachment till 24 hr post-infection (post-treatment) or throughout the course of infection (continuoustreatment), but not with pre-treatment of cells (pre-treatment) or till 16 hr post-infection (shorttreatment), indicating that the inhibition of CBX is not exhibited by targeting the host cells. From these results, it was deduced that DENV itself is the target of CBX. To test this assumption, virucidal activity assay was performed. Both the titer and residual infectivity of DENV were affected as assumed by preincubating with CBX, which manifested in the reduction of viral RNA and viral protein, and the drop in viral titer. Further study found that the level of viral RNA in the supernatants was significantly downregulated in CBX-treated group, demonstrating CBX directly inactivates the progeny DENV particles via its virucidal activity. The virucidal effect of CBX on DENV might be exerted by irreversibly disrupting viral envelope intactness so that virus loses its protection and results in degradation.",

HUVEC cells, a cell line of human umbilical vein endotheliocyte, were also tested as they are a representative of non-cancerous, primary cell type. As a result, DENV-2 was inhibited dose-dependently with increasing CBX in all three cell lines, demonstrating that CBX effectively inhibits DENV-2 in the various cell types targeted by the virus.

Beside DENV, CBX has been previously found to inhibit another virus, HSV [Partridge and Poswillo, 1984; Dargan and Subak-Sharpe, 1986 ]. However, the antiviral mechanisms of CBX on these two viruses are quite distinct. In regarding to HSV, CBX appeared to be active throughout the replication cycle: by reducing the synthesis of some polypeptides, affecting the transportation of certain proteins, and inhibiting the post-translational processing. As a result, CBX treatment greatly diminished progeny HSV quality, and it is thought to inhibit HSV infection in a non-specific manner, by altering cellular activities that can affect virus replication or activate host antiviral mechanisms. While in our model, CBX directly inhibited the infectivity of DENV particles without targeting the host cells. Likewise, further study found that pre-incubation with CBX significantly decreased VSV titer. Taken together, it suggests that the antiviral activity of CBX was not limited to a specific type of virus, and the mechanisms might be something different.",

            "text": "To be pointed out, CBX is a widely used compound as an inhibitor of gap junctions [Connors, 2012] . Gap junctions are fast-track intercellular communication routes. Genetic studies have revealed that connexin (Cx) protein is the molecular component of vertebrate gap junction channels [Paul, 1986] . Gap junctions comprise clusters of transcellular channels that allow small signaling molecules and inorganic ions to transfer rapidly and directly from one cell to another. Recent studies have reported that gap junctions play key roles in the physiological processes and pathological conditions of several viruses, such as HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Borna disease virus, and Rous sarcoma virus [Eugenin, 2014] . Importantly, in order to increase virus production, infection with the latter two viruses above results in down-regulation of Cx expression. As a non-specific gap junction blocker, CBX inhibits various Cx proteins including Cx26, Cx32, Cx36, and Cx43 [Tonkin et al., 2015] . Therefore, the possibility that CBX inhibits DENV infection through blocking Cx proteins could not be ruled out.",

Further studies in suitable animal models would also be required to evaluate the reproducibility of the inhibitory effects of CBX in vivo. In conclusion, our work provides compelling data that CBX has inhibitory effect on DENV infection. Importantly, the antiviral activity of CBX is not limited to a specific cell type or a specific DENV serotype. Combined with its history as a clinical treatment for gastric ulcers or inflammation with a good safety profile [Turpie and Thomson, 1965; Ram et al., 2009] , CBX might potentially be developed as a promising antiviral drug for dengue infection.",
