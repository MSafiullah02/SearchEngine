            "text": "Our goal was to assess the effect of shifting the location of a virus in sequence space towards less \u2018hospitable\u2019 regions that increase its propensity to generate non-sense mutations. However, altering location in sequence space requires changes in nucleotide sequence, which can result in confounding factors such as changes in the amino-acid sequence or RNA structure, or the introduction of nucleotide and codon biases14,15. To minimize these factors, we introduced only synonymous changes, so that viral proteins retained the same amino-acid sequence and the same functions as wild-type virus. Furthermore, we only changed the codons for two amino acids with the highest codon redundancy (leucine and serine) to limit the overall change in nucleotide sequence to less than 5% and to focus on codons on which mutations would have the greatest impact on viability. Among the Leu and Ser codons, we defined a category termed \u20181-to-Stop\u2019, because point mutations on these codons could result in Stop mutations (Fig. 1a). We also defined a \u2018NoStop\u2019 category, which in contrast requires two nucleotide changes to reach Stop mutations. For Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3), we targeted the P1 structural protein-coding region (Fig. 1a), which lacks RNA structural elements required for replication and translation. Because this viral RNA is translated into a single polyprotein that is cleaved into individual viral proteins, a Stop mutation appearing in this region will inactivate the virus. We thus generated CVB3 in which all 117 Ser/Leu codons in P1 were synonymously changed to either 1-to-Stop or NoStop categories. To investigate if this strategy can be applied broadly, we also targeted a very different RNA virus, the influenza A virus, which has a segmented, negative sense genome. In this case, two genomic segments were targeted independently: the PA polymerase subunit protein (111 Ser/Leu codons) or the haemagglutinin glycoprotein HA (94 Ser/Leu codons) (Fig. 1a).",

            "text": "Large-scale codon reshuffling may attenuate viruses by introducing a bias in codon pairs that are under-represented in the human genome14, so we verified that this potentially confounding effect did not occur in our design. We compared our viruses (Fig. 1b) with those used by Coleman et al.14 (PV-Min, PV-Max and PV-SD) to link codon pair bias and attenuation. These poliovirus (a related enterovirus) constructs were codon-shuffled in the same P1 region. The change in codon pair bias in our viruses was significantly less than for the PV-Min virus, which had 1,000-fold reduced replication14. Even PV-SD, which was not attenuated in their study, presented more bias than our constructs. The attenuation obtained from codon reshuffling can also result from dinucleotide bias, where higher CpG content decreases replication15. Compared to the dinucleotide frequency described for the highly attenuated echovirus 7 by Tulloch et al.15 (CpG-high E7), no significant changes in CpG dinucleotide frequency were introduced in our 1-to-Stop and NoStop constructs (Fig. 1c). Subsequently, we investigated the production of infectious particles for these viruses at high (Fig. 1d,e) or low (Supplementary Fig. 1a,b) multiplicities of infection (MOI). All viruses grew to comparable final titres, although fewer infectious progeny were produced at some time points for the CVB3 1-to-Stop construct (Fig. 1d). To test whether this was due to defects in replication, we quantified RNA genome synthesis. All viruses generated the same amounts of RNA at every time point (Fig. 1f,g). We further confirmed these results in an in vitro RNA replication assay using replication complexes purified from infected cells, where yields for wild-type and 1-to-Stop viruses were equal (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, our data showed that, for both CVB3 and influenza A virus, the altered Leu/Ser codons had no discernible impact on RNA synthesis and replication kinetics. Finally, genetic and phenotypic stabilities were evaluated after 10 passages. No reversion in Ser/Leu altered positions was observed, and each virus retained its phenotype (growth titres, relative number of Stop mutations) (Supplementary Fig. 3).",

            "text": "The relative fitness of wild-type, 1-to-Stop and NoStop viruses was measured under normal and mutagenic conditions against a neutral, genetically marked competitor16,17. For CVB3 (Fig. 2a), five mutagenic conditions were used: three base analogues (ribavirin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-azacytidine (5-AZC)), amiloride (which perturbs intracellular Mg2+ and Mn2+ concentrations, essential cofactors of the viral polymerase18) and Mn2+ itself, which increases the polymerase error rate. In all cases, the 1-to-Stop virus presented significantly lower fitness than wild-type CVB3, while the NoStop virus presented the same or higher fitness (Fig. 2a). Using an alternative method to evaluate viral fitness, we measured mean plaque size for each viral population treated with the three base analogues. The 1-to-Stop virus produced significantly smaller plaques, while the NoStop virus produced larger plaques (Fig. 2b). The progeny viruses obtained during mutagenic treatments were then deep-sequenced, and sequence data were computationally treated to reduce noise (see Methods) and mathematically modelled to estimate error (see Supplementary Section \u2018Mathematical assessment of background noise\u2019). The number of reads presenting Stop mutations was then calculated. As expected, 1-to-Stop virus samples contained significantly more reads with Stop mutations than wild-type virus, whereas NoStop had significantly fewer (Fig. 2c). Finally, to further support that the 1-to-Stop viruses were sensitive to the increased mutational load on these codons, we coupled the 1-to-Stop virus with a high-fidelity polymerase19. This virus would have an intrinsically lower error rate to counter the extrinsically higher error resulting from mutagen treatment. Indeed, 1-to-Stop high-fidelity viruses recovered the wild-type virus phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 4).",

Under each mutagenic condition, the 1-to-Stop PA and HA viruses were more sensitive to mutation, presenting lower titres than the wild type and their NoStop counterparts. In fact, 1-to-Stop viruses exhibited up to 50-fold reduction in viral titres with ribavirin treatment (Fig. 3a, left) and a 100-fold decrease after high concentrations of Mn2+ (Fig. 3c, left). We then quantified the number of Stop mutations in the mutagen-treated progeny viruses for each replicate and at each concentration. The 1-to-Stop PA populations presented a dose-dependent and significantly higher increase in the number of Stop mutations along the PA gene compared to wild-type virus (Fig. 3a\u2013c, middle panels). As a control, the 1-to-Stop HA virus, which has a wild type-like PA sequence, did not present more Stop mutations in the PA gene. Instead, the 1-to-Stop HA virus presented more Stop mutations in the HA gene (Fig. 3a\u2013c, right panels).

Previously, we have described CVB3 polymerase variants with intrinsically increased error rates that resemble mutagenic treatment17. We therefore engineered the low-fidelity viral polymerase I230F into the 1-to-Stop virus to generate a \u2018SpeedyStop\u2019 virus. We infected mice with wild-type, 1-to-Stop or SpeedyStop viruses and quantified virus titres in pancreata (Fig. 5a) and hearts (Fig. 5b). The degree of attenuation significantly increased for SpeedyStop virus compared to its normal-fidelity counterpart. Virus was undetectable in some mouse organs as early as three days after infection, and no longer detectable in any organ by day 7. Accordingly, a survival curve of mice receiving a lethal dose of wild type and equivalent doses of 1-to-Stop and SpeedyStop viruses revealed the latter to be completely attenuated (Fig. 5c). Finally, we deep-sequenced virus from infected tissues and confirmed that SpeedyStop presented a higher number of Stop mutations in sequencing reads than the other viruses (Fig. 5d).",

A range of low to high mutagenic conditions was used to accelerate evolution in sequence space and to increase the mutational load. Under normal conditions, both viruses presented mostly positive fitness values (Fig. 6a). Under mutagenic conditions, a greater proportion of wild-type samples presented positive fitness compared to 1-to-Stop virus (Fig. 6a), and the relative decrease in fitness for 1-to-Stop virus was significant under every growth condition. In fact, only 3 populations out of 45 presented positive fitness values with respect to wild-type (Fig. 6b). We then characterized the mutant spectra of each sample by whole-genome deep sequencing to calculate the mean entropy of each population, as a general measure of sequence space exploration. For illustrative purposes, we generated a fitness landscape-like model based on the entropy values coupled with their empirical fitness values (Fig. 6c). The landscape reveals that for similar mean entropy values, 1-to-Stop populations consistently present a lower fitness and are unable to \u2018climb back up\u2019 to the fitness landscape occupied by wild-type virus.",

            "text": "In this work, we present a strategy to attenuate viruses based on evolutionary principles, by restricting their evolutionary potential. Our experimental design is based on the rational relocalization of viral populations in sequence space to redirect them towards detrimental regions of the fitness landscape. Sequence space is a conceptual framework that can help monitor adaptive walks and evolutionary trajectories. For RNA viruses rapidly expanding in sequence space, emerging minority mutations can foretell the directionality of evolution well before the entire population shifts2,20. In theory, however, sequence space is immensely larger than the subregions occupied by biologically viable genotypes. For RNA viruses, these constraints derive from the compact nature of their genomes, and the likelihood that a mutation will hit an essential function is high. Indeed, the majority of mutations are deleterious, as evidenced in many studies that intrinsically or extrinsically increase mutation rates3,10,21\u201323. Despite this, viruses retain high mutation rates to facilitate adaptation. Consequently, mutational robustness has been suggested as an important counter-mechanism24. Although better characterized in theoretical and in silico work25\u201327, some of the best experimental data have been obtained with non-coding RNA structures that assessed the retention of folding capacity or ribozyme activity in light of mutation28. Some evidence for mutational robustness has also been observed in RNA viruses29\u201331. A more recent study that analysed the large-scale codon reshuffling of poliovirus reported the impact of altering mutational robustness4. However, the extent of codon changes was such that robustness could not be decoupled from other effects, such as CpG dinucleotide bias15,32 or codon pair bias14,33.",

            "text": "Redesigning the genomic architecture of an RNA virus, as performed here, relies on using its evolutionary potential to its own detriment. Other studies have recoded all amino acids to achieve viral attenuation, but we focused on two amino acids\u2014leucine and serine\u2014for two main reasons. The first was to minimize the confounding effects of manipulating the genome. In contrast to previous strategies14,34, we targeted less than 5% of the genome. These viruses were designed to minimize or exclude the effects of codon deoptimization35\u201338, codon pair deoptimization14,33,34 and CpG/UpA dinucleotide bias15,32,39. We thus modified a minimum number and class of codons to retain as much as possible of the wild-type identity. However, it should be noted that although the aforementioned effects were minimized, we cannot be certain that some of these factors cannot, at least partially, account for some of the observed attenuation. The second reason for focusing only on leucine and serine was to take advantage of the unique properties of the Leu and Ser codons. These codons are the most redundant, with the greatest range of exploration of sequence space. This feature was addressed in the mathematical framework designed by Archetti40 and based on McLachlan's chemical similarity matrix41, which predicts the potential effect of point mutations over synonymous codons. These codons could be clustered into three groups, among which two were of particular interest for our design. The 1-to-Stop group presented the highest likelihood of changes into non-sense mutational targets (NSMTs). The other set contained the NoStop Ser/Leu codons, which are two mutations away from becoming a Stop codon, and made ideal controls with the same number of modifications.",

Consequently, proximity to \u2018hostile\u2019 regions in sequence space may drive viruses to regions of lower fitness than a normal, more evolvable population42. It should be noted that, in addition to affecting mutational robustness, changes in adaptability and evolvability may also play into the attenuated phenotypes observed here. In addition, our findings experimentally support the notion that viruses may avoid volatile codons that neighbour Stop codons, as was proposed by Plotkin and Dushoff for influenza HA genes43. Moreover, deep sequencing supported the proposed mechanism of attenuation: an increase of three- to sixfold in Stop mutation frequencies. It should be noted that the absolute number of Stop mutations made during infection is probably higher than that captured at the moment of sampling, because such genomes cannot replicate and would thus be degraded and cleared.",

In vivo attenuation was also associated with higher frequencies of Stop mutations in target organs and a higher loss of infectivity. Additionally, translation of RNAs containing Stop codons would result in truncated proteins that may contribute to a better activation of the immune system44,45.

We took several measures to reduce this concern. From a mathematical standpoint, we modelled the noise in our samples and confirmed that our data were unlikely to be affected (see Supplementary Information). In addition, the background noise was further reduced by the maximum likelihood estimation of the frequencies, which takes base Phred quality scores into account. From an experimental and biological standpoint, we implemented many controls, such as the NoStop viral genomes that are as genetically modified as the 1-to-Stop genomes. We also increased sample sizes and biological replicates, performed work in two different RNA viruses, intrinsically (fidelity variants) and extrinsically (mutagenic treatment) altered mutation pressure, and performed work in different cell types and animals. In total, 25 independent experiments, in vitro and in vivo, produced 420 sequencing samples to determine Stop mutations. In all cases, 1-to-Stop generated more Stop mutations than wild-type virus and NoStop controls. Nevertheless, one must consider the noise within the data and must not rely on the absolute values of the measures, but rather their relative values within each experiment with respect to the controls.",

Our data suggest that this strategy could be broadly applied to potentially any RNA virus.

The Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) genome illustrates RNA structures required for replication (5\u2032untranslated region (UTR), IRES, CRE and 3\u2032UTR) and the single open reading frame encoding structural proteins (P1 region) and non-structural proteins (P2, P3 regions). The 117 Ser/Leu codons of the P1 region were altered to construct the 1-to-Stop viruses and NoStop viruses. The influenza A virus genome is composed of eight gene segments. The HA and PA genes were altered at 94 and 111 Ser/Leu codons, respectively, to generate the 1-to-Stop and NoStop viruses. An, polyA tail. b, Codon pair bias of wild-type, 1-to-Stop and NoStop CVB3 and influenza A viruses compared to previously published wild-type poliovirus (PV-WT) and constructs engineered to attenuate viruses through codon pair deoptimization: PV-Max, in which codon pairs over-represented in the human genome were maximized (no reduction in replication); PV-Min, in which codon pair bias was maximized by using codon pairs under-represented in the human genome (1,000-fold reduction in replication); and PV-SD, with randomly shuffled codons (no reduction in replication). c, CpG dinucleotide frequencies in wild-type, 1-to-Stop and NoStop CVB3 and influenza A viruses, relative to previously published wild-type Echovirus 7 (E7) and its high-CpG content construct shown to be attenuated. d, Production of infectious viral progeny over time of wild-type, 1-to-Stop and NoStop CVB3 viruses in HeLa cells infected at MOI = 1. e, Production of infectious viral progeny over time of wild-type, 1-to-Stop PA and HA, and NoStop PA influenza A viruses in MDCK cells infected at MOI = 1. f, Replication kinetics of wild-type, 1-to-Stop and NoStop CVB3 viruses in HeLa cells infected at MOI = 1. g, Replication kinetics of wild type, 1-to-Stop PA and HA, and NoStop PA influenza A viruses in MDCK cells infected at MOI = 1.
