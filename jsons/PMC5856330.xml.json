The Ebola crisis has put the spotlight on the importance of reducing the vulnerability of societies to infectious disease threats that spread across national borders. This aspect of health security\u2014collective health security\u2014has been the focus of attention and the commonly understood conceptualisation of health security for centuries. The paradigm today is rapid detection of these events, and rapid response. But there is a second, equally important aspect to health security that is less appreciated that the west Africa Ebola outbreaks have also tragically highlighted: individual health security. This is security that comes from access to safe and effective health services, products, and technologies. Ebola-infected health workers from developed countries have been repatriated from west Africa for care in their own countries where there is health security for individuals\u2014hospitals that provide safe and effective access to life-saving medicines and services. Meanwhile, Ebola-infected west Africans have had to accept that health care is not always safe, not always effective, and not always accessible\u2014that their own health security is yet again at risk. As the Ebola epidemic has unfolded, the part that has been played by substandard infection control and inadequate access to effective health products and services has clearly demonstrated a wider scope of health security\u2014the intertwining of collective and individual health security.",

This security comes from personal access to safe and effective health services, products, and technologies.\u2022This conceptualisation constitutes only one of many perspectives on the scope of global health security, which constitutes only one part of a broader set of human security threats. Irrespective of the threat, what matters is the centrality of people\u2014not borders, not economies, and not even international relations.\u2022The crisis revealed countries' lack of political commitment to global health security, battered WHO's credibility and highlighted non-compliance with international health law. It has nonetheless resuscitated interest in global health security, but whether the epidemic can rejuvenate global health security as a prominent world affairs issue is unclear.\u2022The epidemic has shown how we are only as safe as the most fragile states and is a reminder that improvement of the capacity of every country to find, stop, and prevent health threats is both in the world's self-interest, and a moral imperative. Far too many blind spots remain around the world.\u2022Health security applies not only to infectious diseases, but also to non-communicable diseases. The anticipated unaffordable costs of non-communicable diseases threaten individual and collective health security.\u2022The Ebola outbreak is only the most recent illustration of how ill suited the medical research and development model is to addressing the world's health priorities. Research and development and access to diagnostics, vaccines, and treatments are crucial to health security, and cannot be left to market forces.\u2022Substandard and falsified drugs pose formidable social, economic, and political challenges to health security. They greatly undermine capabilities to curb both infectious and non-communicable diseases, while eroding public confidence in governments and international institutions.\u2022Setting of priorities and allocation of resources to mitigate the effect of, and recovery after, conflict and natural disaster is a quintessentially political challenge, not merely a technical one. Both individual and collective health security are intimately tied up with successfully meeting this challenge.\u2022In safeguarding of global health security, it is important to pay attention to migration. Fuller implementation of the International Health Regulations in west Africa would have been a far more effective safeguard against migration than travel restrictions. Action can be taken to reduce the risk of, or pre-empt, unwarranted decisions to close borders and detain or deport migrants who have fled health crises.\u2022Collective health security is the sum of individual health security, and compels global action to provide individuals in all countries with access to essential health care. Universal health coverage\u2014universal, equitable access to health care with financial protection\u2014is indispensable for achievement of individual health security and, therefore, collective health and human security. In effect, the international response to the Ebola outbreak reflects this approach.\n\n",

Individual health security, according to Heymann, surfaced with the 2007 Indonesian withholding of avian influenza strains, insisting that poor countries be able to share in the benefits of the vaccines developed for rich markets. He argues that individual health security is dependent on access to vaccines, drugs, and health services.

Ebola illuminates not only the importance of protecting people's lives through disease control but also of the essentiality of a strong health-care system embedded in a prosperous economy and a peaceful society. Even as current control efforts attempt to reach zero cases, there is the reminder that our failure to share the benefits of global economic growth leaves many societies without a health-care system, thus vulnerable to the devastating effect of Ebola and yet another epidemic.

Had systems been in place in the west African countries, the past year would have looked very different. Although the threat of Ebola importation contributed to preparation of an effective response, the other countries already had components of the GHSA in place, and although not fully developed it showed that even nascent capacity was crucial in facilitation of a timely response. In Nigeria, a dedicated public health emergency operations centre for polio eradication and a cadre of Field Epidemiology Training Program-trained56 epidemiologists facilitated the multisectoral coordination and extensive contact tracing efforts needed to control the outbreak once it spread as it spread within Lagos, and from Lagos to a second city.51 A common theme in quelling the Ebola importation events has been the ready availability of trained ministry of health staff who used existing surveillance systems, laboratories, and public health emergency operations capabilities to quickly control Ebola. Unfortunately, there remain far too many blind spots around the globe where public health systems lack trained disease detectives, functional laboratories, and quality surveillance data to make timely decisions about the use of resources to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats within their borders.",

That debate needs deeper insights into the real politic of change possible within government (as opposed to the health department); substantially more sophisticated approaches to interaction with markets and corporations with a view to finding ways to make markets work for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases; and the establishment by leading non-governmental organisations of mutual accountability systems supported by global investors in ways that the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) has achieved.

First, the Ebola crisis has reinforced that more research is needed on the effect of health crises on international migration, to inform more effective policy making. An historical review of health crises has indicated that they rarely result in large scale migration.114 When it has occurred, as for example from Beijing during the 2003 SARS outbreak, migration tends to be internal, temporary, and early on in the health crisis. It has been difficult to discern disease from other underlying factors such as poverty and persecution where international migration has occurred during health crises, for example during the cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe in 2009.115 Overall the evidence is scarce, anecdotal, and hard to verify. Empirical challenges involve identification of and access to affected populations; conceptual challenges include attribution and distinguishing of health from other motivations to migrate.",

In the current Ebola crisis, the longstanding lack of access to basic primary care, laboratories with insufficient capacity, and shortage of existing hospital infrastructure to isolate and treat infected people left communities with little trust in the health system, families with no help to tend for their seriously ill members, and fuelled the spread of the epidemic and its resulting death toll.",

Additionally, the health security threat of non-communicable diseases cannot be mitigated without provision of horizontally integrated primary care that can prevent, diagnose, and manage a wide range of illnesses. Unless all countries have effective universal health coverage, populations will also be inclined to travel across borders to seek care, increasing the potential for infection to spread and posing social and economic burdens and possible threats to law and order in other nations.
