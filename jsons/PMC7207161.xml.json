            "text": "There are many other theories to explain the low number of COVID\u201019 cases in Japan, yet we still do not have enough information to determine the cause of this striking discrepancy. Clearly, we do not understand what causes these differences. Many of these hypotheses can be tested as suggested above, such as examining ACE2 expression levels in the respiratory tract, GWAS data on COVID\u201019 susceptibility, and whether BCG vaccines indeed confer long\u2010term innate immune resistance to SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. The three\u2010pronged approach by the Cluster Response Team of the Japanese Ministry of Health has thus far contained the spread of COVID\u201019 by quickly identifying clusters of infections, testing, and quarantine of the infected individuals. A word of caution is whether this approach will work in cases where super\u2010spreaders ignite a large\u2010scale transmission, or when there are multiple clusters that occur throughout the country at once. Perhaps one of the reasons for the low number of cases in Japan might relate to lack of super\u2010spreader events to date. Just within the last 24 h, Japan has declared the state of emergency, as Tokyo faces more than 1,000 confirmed cases, more than double the number a week ago. Perhaps stronger social distancing measures are required to keep the curve flattened in Japan.",
