            "text": "The rate of spread of an epidemic and whether it is self-sustaining depend on the basic reproduction number (R0). R0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by 1 primary case in a susceptible population [10]. This quantity determines the potential for an infectious agent to start an outbreak, the extent of transmission in the absence of control measures, and the ability of control measures to reduce spread. During the course of an epidemic, Rt the effective reproduction number, decreases in comparison with R0 as a result of the depletion of susceptible persons in the population, death or recovery with subsequent immunity, and the implementation of specific control measures. To stop an outbreak, Rt must be maintained below 1. Mathematical modeling of the early phase of the Singapore and Hong Kong outbreaks, before the institution of control measures and during which time it was occurring primarily in the hospital setting, estimated that the R0 was 2.2\u20133.7, indicating that the virus is moderately infective [11, 12]. The attack rate for SARS-CoV ranges from 10.3% to 60% or 2.4 to 31.3 cases/1000 exposure-hours, depending on the clinical setting and the unit of measurement [13]. A significant limitation of these calculations is that these data are based on diagnoses made with a clinical case definition. Reanalysis will be required once the results of seroprevalence studies are completed and will provide a more accurate estimate of R0.",

Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV is transmitted by contact and/or droplets [6, 15] and that the use of any mask (surgical or N95) significantly decreases the risk of infection [16]. However, there are cases that defy explanation based on these modes of transmission, suggesting that alternative modes of transmission may also exist [13, 17]. SARS-CoV remains viable in feces for days [18], and the outbreak at the Amoy Gardens apartments highlights the possibility of a fecal-oral or fecal-droplet mode of transmission [19, 20]. A number of cases occurred in health care workers wearing protective equipment following exposure to high-risk aerosol- and droplet-generating procedures, such as airway manipulation, administration of aerosolized medications, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and bronchoscopy or intubation [17, 21, 22]. When intubation is necessary, measures should be taken to reduce unnecessary exposure to health care workers, including reducing the number of health care workers present and adequately sedating or paralyzing the patient to reduce cough. Updated infection control precautions for patients who have SARS are available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/index.htm.",

Fever can vary from low to high grade and can occasionally be absent at presentation, particularly in older patients. The typical respiratory phase starts 2\u20137 days after the prodrome and can be associated with watery diarrhea [14, 21, 28]. The early respiratory stage includes a dry, nonproductive cough and mild dyspnea. Early-phase chest radiographs often show subtle peripheral pulmonary infiltrates that can be more readily detected as consolidations having a ground-glass appearance with high-resolution CT of the lung [29, 30]. Atypical presentations of the disease have been described elsewhere [31, 32], including cases involving fever but no respiratory component [33]. Asymptomatic cases have also been described, but only in small numbers [34]. Of interest, the disease has been rare in children and, when present, has appeared to be milder [33, 35].",

In 10%\u201320% of hospitalized patients, persistent or progressive hypoxia results in the requirement of intubation and mechanical ventilation [28, 36, 37]. Among patients developing respiratory failure, intubation is required at a median of 8 days after onset of symptoms [35, 36]. Subtle but progressive decreases in oxygen saturation are often indicative of impeding respiratory failure and should trigger more-intensive monitoring and preparation for intubation under controlled circumstances.

The sensitivity of culture is lower than that of RT-PCR [43]. The specificity of the RT-PCR assays can be assured by using specific probes, sequencing the RT-PCR product, or completing a second RT-PCR assay using primers amplifying a different genome region. Quality-control measures should be in place to prevent false-positive results due to laboratory contamination. The analytic sensitivity of these assays has been shown to be high, with reproducible detection limits of 10 copies of viral RNA [44]. However, on the basis of the results of first-generation assays, the clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV RT-PCR has been estimated to be as low as 50%, depending on the type of specimens tested and the timing of collection relative to the onset of symptoms of SARS [6, 42]. Specimens that have the highest proportion positive for SARS-CoV using first-generation assays include nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat swabs, and stool (highest yield) [14, 42, 43]. Specimen obtainment \u223c10 days from symptom onset is associated with the highest yield for all specimen types, which correlates with the timing of peak virus loads [14]. Optimization of SARS-CoV RT-PCR assays with regard to the targeted genomic region, the timing of specimen obtainment, the type of specimens, and the extraction methodology is ongoing. A recent report describes a second generation assay with a clinical sensitivity of 80% using a modified extraction method on nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained in the first 3 days of illness [45].",

These studies were not controlled, and most patients also received corticosteroids [15, 21, 50]. Other reports failed to identify improvement with ribavirin [28, 51], and one report identified a high frequency of adverse events among patients treated with high-dose ribavirin, including severe hemolysis (in 49% of patients) [28]. In vitro testing of SARS-CoV indicated that ribavirin does not have activity against this virus at clinically achievable concentrations [52].

Preliminary results demonstrate decreasing virus loads and increasing antibody titers during the second week of illness, at a time when the respiratory disease typically progresses [14]. These results suggest that lung damage in patients with SARS-CoV infection may be immune mediated and provides the rationale for corticosteroid therapy. Pathological findings are consistent with cytokine dysregulation and provide further support for the theory that lung damage is immune mediated [52]. Initial case reports described resolution of fever and improvements in oxygenation and radiographic appearance in some patients treated with ribavirin and corticosteroids [59]. Subsequently, clinicians noted that cases in many patients progress despite receiving treatment with corticosteroids, and higher doses or pulsed steroid regimens were required as rescue therapy [60, 61]. A trial comparing early use of pulsed versus nonpulsed corticosteroids did not note any difference in the requirement for ventilation or mortality, but it did reveal improvements in oxygenation and radiographic appearance [62].",

Pathological studies have detected high virus loads in patients who died >50 days into their illness and suggest that persistent viral replication is occurring and likely contributes to the pathophysiology of lung damage in SARS-CoV infection [53]. The use of corticosteroids could potentially increase or prolong viral replication and thereby worsen disease. Corticosteroids are also associated with a number of well-known adverse outcomes including immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens, particularly those causing invasive fungal infections [63, 64]. In one multivariate analysis of 218 patients with SARS, use of pulsed corticosteroid therapy was strongly associated with mortality, although the results are difficult to interpret, because the sickest patients typically received pulsed corticosteroids as salvage therapy [65]. There have also been reports from China of avascular necrosis\u2014a well-recognized complication of steroid therapy\u2014occurring in patients who recovered from SARS [66]. IVIG consists of pooled antibodies from multiple donors. Although IVIG would not be expected to contain antibodies directed against SARS-CoV because of the low rate of background immunity in the population, it has been demonstrated to have other immunomodulatory properties and may down-regulate cytokine expression [67]. Convalescent-phase plasma samples have been used to treat SARS in Hong Kong and China and may be of value because, unlike standard IVIG preparations, high levels of anti\u2013SARS-CoV antibodies would be present [68]. Finally, plasma exchange was used as salvage therapy in Hong Kong, but no data exist with which to assess its efficacy [69].",
