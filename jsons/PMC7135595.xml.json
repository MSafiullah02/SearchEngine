            "text": "Clinical features of uncomplicated acute bronchitis develop in sequential phases. Acutely, there is direct inoculation of the tracheobronchial epithelium, characterized clinically by variable constitutional symptoms, including fever, malaise, and myalgias. These symptoms usually last 1 to 5 days, depending on the infectious agent. This phase of illness is often indistinguishable from other acute upper respiratory tract infections. Most uncomplicated upper respiratory infections improve substantially within 5 to 7 days [19], [20]. In patients for whom the diagnosis of acute bronchitis would be appropriate, however, the acute phase is followed by a second, protracted phase characterized by persistent cough, often accompanied by phlegm production or wheezing. This second phase usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks, and has as its underlying pathophysiology the hypersensitivity of the tracheobronchial epithelium and airway receptors (reactive airway disease).",

Vagal-mediated airway hyperresponsiveness has been shown to coincide with repair of the bronchial epithelium [26]. Other mechanisms of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, such as adrenergic-cholinergic tone imbalance and IgE-mediated histamine release, also may be present. PFT abnormalities seem to be common in acute bronchitis, with approximately 40% of patients demonstrating significant abnormalities by forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or histamine challenge [27], [28]. PFT abnormalities are usually transient, typically resolving after 2 to 3 weeks, although they may last as long as 2 months [27], [28], [29]. Recurrent episodes of \u201cacute bronchitis\u201d may suggest underlying asthma [30], [31]. Although undiagnosed asthma should be considered in patients who have acute cough illness, this diagnosis is difficult to establish because bronchial hyperresponsiveness and PFT abnormalities are frequent in patients who have acute bronchitis. Suspicion and work-up for asthma should be reserved for patients with cough lasting longer than 3 weeks [17].",

Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are the only bacterial pathogens that have been established as causes of acute bronchitis. Although studies have reported the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in adults with acute bronchitis, these studies generally failed to exclude patients who had underlying lung disease, failed to distinguish between colonization and infection [49], or did not differentiate adequately patients who had pneumonia from those who had acute bronchitis when determining causative agents [33]. Furthermore, acute viral respiratory infections seem to increase the proliferation of these bacteria among the oropharyngeal flora [50], further complicating the issue of colonization versus infection. Therefore, sputum Gram stain and culture for common bacterial pathogens have no clinical usefulness in patients who have acute bronchitis.",

Attack rates vary highly, reflecting the seasonal, geographic, and epidemic nature of these infections [21], [27], [33], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60]. Studies attempting to distinguish these atypical bacterial pathogens from viral etiologies have shown that patients infected with atypical bacterial pathogens tend to present to medical attention much later than those with confirmed viral bronchitis [21], [60], [61], and are more likely to have wheezing on clinical examination [21]. In several studies, although these pathogens were present by antibody titer or gene amplification, treatment with antibiotics appropriate to atypical pathogens did not change outcome [33], [62], [63], [64], [65]. This suggests that in acute bronchitis, C pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae may reflect copathogens or inciting factors for secondary infectious processes, rather than the etiologic agent. Alternatively, because patients with atypical bacterial pathogens present late in the course of illness, the acute infectious process may have resolved with only residual reactive airway disease present at the time of presentation for medical care.",

Because of the small sample size of the trial, few pertussis cases were reported (n = 12), and no point estimate of efficacy could be given. The incidence of primary pertussis cases was decreased in the aP group (0.8 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI 0.0\u20132.1), however, compared with the control group (3.7 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI 1.2\u20136.2).

Studies have failed to show any meaningful benefit from antibiotics in the treatment of acute bronchitis, however. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of nine randomized placebo-controlled trials conducted between 1970 and 2000 conclude that routine antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis has no consistent effect on either the duration or severity of illness. In one meta-analysis, there was no significant impact on the duration of cough [126], but two other meta-analyses reported a small but statistically significant decrease in cough duration (one third days fewer of cough after 7 days) associated with treatment with antibiotics [127], [128]. In all three meta-analyses, there was no significant impact on overall illness duration, activity limitation, or work loss. A recent randomized, double-blind, controlled study comparing azithromycin with vitamin C has addressed concerns that the earlier trials were performed with older antibiotics, some of which had no activity against the atypical agents implicated in acute bronchitis [129]. This study found no advantage to antibiotic treatment on illness outcomes or return-to-work status.",

Treatment for high-risk exposed individuals and those who present within 48 hours of symptom onset is also possible. Amantadine, rimantidine, zanamivir, and oseltamivir decrease illness duration by approximately 1 day and lead to a 0.5-day quicker return to normal activities [157]. The primary difference between the agents is that the neuraminidase inhibitors are effective against influenza A and B, whereas amantadine and rimantidine are effective only against influenza A. The relative proportion of cases caused by each type of influenza virus varies from year to year, and is determined best through consultation with local public health agencies. Adverse events are modestly more common with rimantidine (32% of patients, most commonly central nervous system) than with the neuraminidase inhibitors (24% of patients, mostly gastrointestinal) [157]. Because each of these therapies is only effective if initiated within the first 48 hours, and preferably 30 hours, of symptom onset, rapid diagnosis is key. During documented influenza outbreaks, the positive predictive value of clinical diagnosis based on clinician judgment is good (correct approximately 70% of the time) [158], and compares favorably with rapid diagnostic tests for influenza (sensitivities of 63%\u201381%) [158], [159], [160]. Diagnosis of influenza in a nonoutbreak period is more difficult and diagnostic testing should be considered.",

In the recent study, adult patients who had acute bronchitis of greater than 48 hours' duration and a bronchial severity score (BSS) of at least 5 points were enrolled. Patients were excluded if they were to receive or recently had received antibiotics or had other serious illnesses. Patients were randomized to receive active ingredient or color-, smell-, viscosity-, and taste-matched placebo. Among patients receiving pelargonium, decrease in BSS on day 7 was 5.9 points compared with 3.2 points for placebo (P < .0001). Duration of illness (P < .001) and inability to work (16% versus 43%, P < .0001) were significantly less in the pelargonium group compared with placebo.
