According to Hayashi (2009), Hayashi and Sudo (2009), G. glabra is found in South Europe (Spain, Italy), Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Central Asia and the north-western part of China, while G. uralensis is found in Central Asia, Mongolia and north-western and north-eastern parts of China, and G. inflata is found only in the north-eastern part, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China. G. glabra is divided into two varieties: G. glabra var. typica (Spanish licorice) and G. glabra var. glandulifera (Russian licorice) (Hayashi and Sudo 2009). Three varieties of G. glabra have been reported; the Spanish and Italian licorice, assigned to G. glabra var. typica; Russian licorice to G. glabra var. glandulifera; Persian and Turkish licorice to G. glabra var. violacea (Nomura et al. 2002).\n\n",

Dried liquorice root can be chewed as a sweet. The extract of liquorice in rolls is glossy black in colour, often used in cough lozenges and pastilles. In Calabria a popular liqueur is made from pure liquorice extract. Liquorice is also very popular in Syria and Egypt, where it is sold as a drink, in shops as well as by the street vendors. Liquorice is used by brewers to flavour and colour porter classes of beers, and the enzymes in the root also stabilize the foam heads produced by beers brewed with it. Licorice powder used in sweets, baked goods, ice cream, soft drinks, etc., and the powdered root is also used as a sweetener in other herbal teas (Facciola 1990). The leaves are used as a tea substitute in Mongolia (Facciola 1990).",

            "text": "The licorice root contains glycyrrhizin, a substance that is 50 times sweeter than sucrose (Hill 1952; Facciola 1990; Bown 1995). Glycyrrhizin imparts a sweet taste to foods; moreover, it has salt-softening and flavour-enhancing properties and is also heat stable (Hayashi and Sudo 2009). Most Japanese people do not like the long-lasting sweet taste of glycyrrhizin; however, a more acceptable sweetness can be created by using a combination of glycyrrhizin and natural sugars or other sweeteners. Therefore, glycyrrhizin and licorice extracts are used as food additives in a variety of foods such as snacks, instant noodles, sausages and sauces. Glycyrrhizin is used in sweet foods such as sweet snacks, sweets and candies, ice creams and sherbets to enhance their sweetness. It is also used to reduce the saltiness of salty foods such as soy sauce, other sauces, savoury snacks, \u2018kamaboko\u2019 (boiled fish paste), tsukudani (fish boiled in soy sauce), \u2018tsukemono\u2019 (Japanese pickles) and sausages in Japan. In Japan, enzymatically modified licorice extract (a-glycosyl-glycyrrhizin) and enzymatically hydrolysed licorice extract (glycyrrhetinic acid 3-O-glucuronide) are also used as sweeteners (Hayashi and Sudo 2009). Most liquorice is used as a flavouring agent for tobacco. Licorice not only imparts a sweet taste but also an aroma of tobacco, which makes it mild (Nieman 1959). It also prevents the desiccation of tobacco. The licorice extracts used in the tobacco industry are supplied by an American company, namely, MAFCO. Licorice extracts were first used for flavouring confectionery products in England during the eighteenth century in Pontefract in Yorkshire; it was blended with sugar, flour and other ingredients to make Pontefract cakes (Nieman 1959). Nowadays, licorice confectionery is widely available in western countries, and large quantities of licorice are used in the confectionery industry. In the Netherlands, where liquorice candy (\u2018drop\u2019) is one of the most popular forms of sweets, only a few of the many forms that are sold contain aniseed, although mixing it with mint, menthol or with laurel is quite popular. Glycyrrhiza glabra root is one of the common traditional Chinese medicines and used as flavouring and sweetening agents for tobaccos, chewing gums, candies, toothpaste and beverages (Dong et al. 2007).",

The chemical constituents of the roots include several bioactive compounds such as glycyrrhizin (\u223c16 %), different sugars (up to 18 %), flavonoids, saponoids, sterols, starches, amino acids, gums and essential oils. Licorice roots were reported to contain 25\u201330 % starch, 3\u201310 % d-glucose and sucrose, 3\u20135 % glycyrrhizin and traces of flavonoids, saponoids, sterols, amino acids, etc. (Fenwick et al. 1990).

            "text": "The roots of G. glabra were reported to contain 1.6 % of water soluble polysaccharides consisting of rhamnose, arabinose, mannose, glucose and galactose, and also 9.7 % of total polysaccharides (Dzhumamuratova et al. 1978). Denisova et al. (2003) found that >50 % of the ethanol extract of licorice root consisted of monosaccharides and disaccharides (7\u20138 mass % of the dry raw material). The principal component was saccharose (46.78 %). Significant quantities of d-mannopyranose (9.06 %), \u03b2-d-glucopyranose (7.06 %) and 2-O-hydroxyethylglucose (12.84 %) and smaller quantities of sorbose (4.12 %), \u03b1-d-fructose (2.01 %), \u03b2-d-fructose (2.56 %) and \u03b2-d-galactofuranose (1.88 %) were observed among the identified sugars. The sugar alcohols mannopyranosyl-d-glucitol (3.49 %), ribitol (0.95 %), mannitol (1.33 %), and myo-inositol (0.33 %) were present in insignificant amounts. Rhizomes were reported to contain alkaloids, triterpenes, saponins, flavonoids, polysaccharides, steroids and tannins (Meena et al. 2010). An acidic polysaccharide, named glycyrrhizan GA, was isolated from the stolon of Glycyrrhiza glabra var. glandulifera (Shimizu et al. 1991). Its molecular mass was estimated to be 85,000 and it comprised l-arabinose: d-galactose: l-rhamnose: d-galacturonic acid: d-glucuronic acid in the molar ratio of 22:10:1:2:1, in addition to small amounts of O-acetyl groups. Glycyrrhizan GA, a representative polysaccharide with remarkable phagocytosis-enhancing activity, was isolated from the stolon of Glycyrrhiza glabra var. glandulifera (Takada et al. 1992). The core structural features of glycyrrhizan GA included a backbone chain composed of \u03b2-1,3-linked d-galactose residues. Three-fifths of the galactose units in the backbone carry side chains composed of \u03b2-1,3- and \u03b2-1,6-linked d-galactosyl residues at position 6. Monosaccharide composition of the polysaccharides isolated, measured as alditol acetates, of Chinese and Hungarian G. glabra roots was very similar, but the Lithuanian G. glabra and the G. echinata were quite different (Gy\u00e9m\u00e1nt et al. 2001). All investigated samples contained glucuronic acid, the G. echinata contained also galacturonic acid. Although the yield of Hungarian origin species was found lower than the yield of eastern species, the uronic acid content was similar (Kiss et al. 1998). The water-extracted arabinogalactan protein enriched fraction of Glycyrrhiza glabra was found to consist mainly of 3- and 3,6-linked galactopyranosyl, and 5- and 3,5-linked arabinofuranosyl residues (Saha et al. 2011). The hexane extract of G. glabra was found to contain 70 % neutral and 30 % polar lipids (Denisova et al. 2007). Among neutral lipids, the main components were sterol esters (SEs), which accounted for about half of this fraction. Triacylglycerides (TAGs), free fatty acids (FFAs) and free sterols (FSs) comprised this fraction in approximately equal proportions, amounting to 10.0, 10.5 and 11.5 %.",

Glabric acid was isolated by Beaton and Spring (1956). Bogatkina et al. (1975) isolated 3,24-dihydroxy-ll, 13(18)-oleanadien-30-oic acid as a methyl ester. The following triterpenoid compounds were isolated from G. glabra roots, a pentacyclic triterpenoid, liquoric acid, was isolated as the methyl ester (Elgamal et al. 1965); another triterpenoid glabric acid (Elgamal and Fayez 1968), 7-hydroxy-4\u2032-methoxy-isoflavone (formononetin) (Reiners 1966; Elgamal and Fayez 1972), another triterpenoid, 28-hydroxyglycyrrhetic acid (Elgamal and El-Tawil 1975); a carboxylie-dialcoholic triterpenoid was isolated as the diacetate-methyl ester (Elgamal and Fayez 1975); five new pentacyclic triterpenoids 11-desoxoglycyrrhetic acid acetate methyl ester; 24-acetoxy-l 1-desoxoglycyrrhetic acid acetate methyl ester; 11-desoxo-glabrolide acetate; glabrolide acetate and 3 \u00df-acetyl-18 \u00df-hydroxy- 1 l-keto-olean-12-en-30-oic acid, 30,18 \u00df-lactone were isolated as minor constituents together with 24-hydroxy-11-desoxoglycyrrhetic acid methyl ester, 3 \u00df, 18 \u00df-dihydroxy-11 -keto-olean-12-en-30-oic acid, 30,18 \u00df-lactone and glabrolide (Elgamal et al. 1990).

            "text": "Glycyrol, glycyrin, isoglycyrol and glycycoumarin were isolated from the methanolic extract of licorice roots from northwest China, G. glabra var. glandulifera (Hattori et al. 1986). A new 2-arylbenzofuran derivative named licocoumarone with the structure 2-(2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)-6-hydroxy-4-methoxy-5-(3-methyl-2-butenyl) coumarone was isolated from commercially available xibei licorice (seihoku kanzo) along with a known 3-arylcoumarin derivative, glycycoumarin (Demizu et al. 1988). An anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) phenolic constituent, licopyranocoumarin, and two other new phenolics named licoarylcoumarin and glisoflavone together with glycyrrhisoflavanone, kaempferol 3-O-methyl ether and licocoumarone were isolated from Si-pei licorice (a commercial licorice; root and stolon of Glycyrrhiza sp. from the north-western region of China) (Hatano et al. 1989). Licuraside was isolated from G. glabra and on hydrolysis afforded liquiritigenin and isoliquiritigenin (Gorecki et al. 1991). From G. glabra (Xinjiang) roots the following were isolated five flavonoids and four coumarins, namely, liquiritin, isoliquiritin, liquiritigenin, isoliquiritigenin, glycycoumarin, isoglycycoumarin, licochalcone A, glycyrol and isoglycyrol (Zeng et al. 1990); glycyrrhizic acid, isoliquiritin, liquiritin, liquiritigenin, glycoumarin, isoglycoumarin and uralsaponin B (Zeng et al. 1991a); and three saponins glycyrrhizic acid (S-I), uralsaponin B and uralsaponin A (Zeng et al. 1991b). Five new flavonoid compounds named glucoliquiritin apioside (a flavonone bisdesmoside), prenyllicoflavone A (a bisprenylflavone), shinflavone (a prenylated pyranoflavanone), shinpterocarpin and 1-methoxyphaseollin (both pyranopterocarpans) were isolated together with eight known saponins (glycyrrhizin, licorice-saponins A3, C2, E2, G2, H2, apioglycyrrhizin and araboglycyrrhizin), and seven known flavonoid glycosides (ononin, liquiritin, liquiritin apioside, isoliquiritin, neoisoliquiritin, luciraside and isoliquiritin apioside) from the aqueous fraction of the methanol extract of G. glabra dried roots (\u2018Shinkyo-Kanzo\u2019 in Japanese) collected in Xinjiang province, China (Kitagawa et al. 1994). The ethyl acetate fraction yielded three known chalcones (licochalcone A and B, and echinatin), two new prenylated flavonoids (prenyllicoflavone A and shinflavanone) together with two known prenylated flavonoids (glabrol, licoflavone A), three known isoflavonoids (hispaglabridin A and B, and methylhispaglabridin B), two new pyranopterocarpans (shinpterocarpin and 1-methoxyphaseollin) and two known pterocarpans (medicarpin and ent-(\u2212)-hemileiocarpin). A new prenylated isoflavan derivative, kanzonol R, was isolated from G. glabra (Fukai et al. 1994). A large amount of glabridin, a prenylated flavonoid, was detected exclusively in the cork layer and the decayed part of the thickening roots while large amounts of flavonoid glycosides, liquiritigenin glycosides and isoliquiritigenin glycosides were mainly distributed in the woody part of the thickening roots (Hayashi et al. 1996b). The isoflavans hispaglabridin A, hispaglabridin B, glabridin, and 4\u2032-O-methylglabridin, the two chalcones, isoprenylchalcone derivative and isoliquiritigenin, and the isoflavone, formononetin were isolated from G. glabra roots (Vaya et al. 1997). Two new 3-arylcoumarin derivatives were isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra root and their structures were elucidated as 2\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxy-[6\u2033,6\u2033-dimethylpyrano(2\u2033,3\u2033:7,8)]-3-arylcoumarin and [6\u2032,6\u2033-dimethylpyrano(2\u2033,3\u2033:7,8)]-2\u2032-hydroxy-4\u2032-methoxy-3-arylcoumarin (Kinoshita et al. 1997). Two known isoflavonoids glabrene and glabrone were also isolated. From the ether soluble fraction of the crude licorice root, licoricidin, 1-methoxyphaseollin, 6,8-diprenylgenistein and 1-methoxyphaseollidin were isolated (Nagumo et al. 1999). Isoflavan derivatives, glabridin, hispaglabridin A, hispaglabridin B, 4\u2032-O-methylglabridin and 3\u2032-hydroxy-4\u2032-O-methylglabridin were isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra (Haraguchi et al. 2000). Yuldashev et al. (2000b) isolated the following flavonoids from above ground parts of G. glabra grown in Uzbekistan: 7-O-methylglabranin, glabranin (8-C-prenylpinocembrin) (5,7-dihydroxy-8-(\u03b3,\u03b3-dimethylallyl)-flavanone), pinocembrin, galangin and a new isoflavanoid glabrisoflavone with the structure (E)-5,7,3\u2032-trihydroxy-6-(3-hydroxymethyl-2-butenyl)-isoflavone.",

Minor phenolic compounds comprising many isoprenoid-substituted flavonoids, chromenes, coumarins, dihydrostilbenes and dihydrophenanthrenes were isolated from Glycyrrhiza species. Ninety phenolic compounds were isolated from G. glabra. Fifty were substituted isoprenoid groups, for example, in Type I licorice Spanish and Russian, the main isoprenoid-substituted flavonoid was a pyronoisoflavan, glabridin. The 5-position of most flavonoids was unsubstituted, for example, glabrene, glabrol and 3-hyrdoxyglabrol. Type 2 licorice comprising Chinese and Kirghiz G. glabra, both 5-unsubstituted flavonoids and 5-oxygenated flavonoids, for example, 3,8\u2032-diprenylated dalbergioidin was isolated. Most flavonoids were 5-hyrdoxy-flavonoids or 5-methoxy-flavonoids. The main isoprenoid-substituted flavonoid of Kirghiz licorice was 3,8\u2032-diprenylated dalbergioidin but glabridin had not been isolated. Fourteen flavonoids were isolated and purified from the benzene extract (33 g) of the roots of Kirghiz licorice (G. glabra): 3\u2032,8-diprenyldalbergioidin (630 mg) 3\u2032,6-diprenyldalbergioidin (67 mg), licoisoflavanone (19 mg), glyasperin A (25 mg), glyasperin C (20 mg), glyasperin D (49 mg), isoderone (1 mg), semilicoisoflavone B (3 mg), 8-(\u03b3,\u03b3-dimethylallyl)-wighteone (13 mg), gancaonin G (2 mg), gancaonin H (27 mg), 1-methoxyphaseollidin (53 mg), edudiol (3,9-dihydroxy-1-methoxy-2-prenypterocarpan) (12 mg) and glabrene (5 mg), 3\u2032(\u03b3,\u03b3-dimethylallyl)kievitone, glisoflavanone (3\u2032,6-diprenyl-2,4\u2032,5,7-tetrahydroxyisoflavanone), isoderone (2,2-dimethylpyranol [4\u2032,3\u2032]-5,7-dihydroxyisoflavone), 1-methoxyphaseollidin (Fukai et al. 2001). From European G. glabra cultivated in Japan the following flavonoids were isolated: glabrene, glabridin, 4\u2032-O-methylglabridin, hispaglabridin A (3\u2032-prenylglabridin), glabrol, 3-hydroxyglabrol, glabrone, medicarpin (3-hydroxy-9-methoxypterocarpan), shinpterocarpin, euchrenone a5, glyinflanin K, glyinflanin G, two pyrano-2-arylbenzofurans, kanzonols U and V, a pyrano-3-arylcoumarin, kanzonol W, a diprenylated isoflavan, kanzonol X, a diprenylated \u03b1-hydroxydihydrochalcone kanzol Y ((\u03b1R)-3,5\u2032-diprenyl-\u03b1,2\u2032,4,4\u2032-tetrahydroxydihydrochalcone), kanzol Z (prenylated 3-hydroxypyranoflavanone) and 3-hydroxyparatocarpin (Fukai et al. 1996a, 1998). A new isoprenoid-substituted isoflavone, kanzonol T, was isolated from Chinese licorice, Glycyrrhiza glabra, along with eight known flavonoids (Fukai et al. 1996b). The structure of glabrene was revised. Seven constituents, isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra, were identified as the isoflavans hispaglabridin A, hispaglabridin B, glabridin and 4\u2032-O-methylglabridin, the two chalcones, isoprenylchalcone derivative and isoliquiritigenin, and the isoflavone, formononetin (Vaya et al. 1997). Two new isoflavones named glabroisoflavones A and B, and a 3-arylcoumarin derivative glabrocurmarin and a known isoflavene derivative 3,4-didehdyroglabridin were isolated from the dichloromethane extract of commercially available licorice root (Kinoshita et al. 2005). Licochalcone-A, a novel flavonoid, was isolated from licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra) (Fu et al. 2004). Licocalchone-C was isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra (Franceschelli et al. 2011). Two new flavonosides were isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra roots and identified as 5,8-dihydroxy-flavone-7-O-\u03b2-d-glucuronide, glychionide A and 5-hydroxy-8-methoxyl-flavone-7-O-\u03b2-d-glucuronide, glychionide B (Li et al. 2005).",

            "text": "Glycyrrhizin, a major bioactive compound in liquorice root, had been reported to be 50 times sweeter than sugar (Nitalikar et al. 2010). Licorice extracts had been widely used in pharmaceutical and confectionery industries because of the presence of glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizin was postulated to be most likely derived from the triterpene \u03b2-amyrin, an initial product of the cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene (Seki et al. 2008). CYP88D6, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450) gene, was successfully identified as a glycyrrhizin-biosynthetic gene. CYP88D6 was characterized by in-vitro enzymatic activity assays and shown to catalyse the sequential two-step oxidation of \u03b2-amyrin at C-11 to produce 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin, a possible biosynthetic intermediate between \u03b2-amyrin and glycyrrhizin. CYP88D6 expression was detected in the roots and stolons but not in the stem and leaves. A second relevant P450 (CYP72A154) was identified and shown to be responsible for C-30 oxidation in the glycyrrhizin pathway (Seki et al. 2011). CYP72A154 expressed in an engineered yeast strain that endogenously produced 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin (a possible biosynthetic intermediate between \u03b2-amyrin and glycyrrhizin) catalysed three sequential oxidation steps at C-30 of 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin supplied in situ to produce glycyrrhetinic acid, a glycyrrhizin aglycone.",

            "text": "Based on nucleotide sequences of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit gene (rbcL) sequences, six Glycyrrhiza species were divided into two groups: three, G. glabra, G. uralensis and G. inflata, producing glycyrrhizin as a major saponin, and the others, G. echinata, G. macedonica and G. pallidiflora, producing macedonoside C as a major saponin (Hayashi et al. 2000b). Among the three glycyrrhizin-producing species, only two nucleotide substitutions were observed between the rbcL sequences of G. glabra and G. uralensis, and the sequence of G. uralensis was identical to that of G. inflata, indicating G. uralensis and G. inflata to be closely related. Regarding six main constituents of licorice, glycyrrhizin, liquiritin, liquiritin apioside, isoliquiritin, isoliquiritin apioside and liquiritigenin, the constituent property of G. glabra was similar to that of G. inflata; both were dissimilar to G. uralensis which was characterized by a wide content variation of the six constituents compared to those of G. glabra and/or G. inflata (Kondo et al. 2007). The mean contents of liquiritin, isoliquiritin or liquiritigenin in G. uralensis were significantly higher than those of G. glabra or G. inflata. Additionally, glycycoumarin, glabridin and licochalcone A were reconfirmed as the species-specific typical constituents of G. uralensis, G. glabra and G. inflata, respectively. Hatano et al. (1991a) found that the root and rhizome of G. glabra, and the licorice specimens imported from the Soviet Union and Afghanistan (Type B) contained glabridin and glabrene; the roots and rhizomes of G. uralensis, commercial licorice specimens from the north-western region of China (Seihoku-kanzo) and from the north-eastern region of China (Tohoku-kanzo) in Japanese markets, and also several licorice specimens from Chinese markets (Type A) contained licopyranocoumarin, glycycoumarin and/or licocoumarone, which were not found in G. glabra and G. inflata. Root sample of G. inflata (Type C) contained licochalcones A and B, which were not found in the samples of the other two Glycyrrhiza species. Extracts of some licorice specimens of types A and B, and all of the licorice specimens of type C inhibited 40\u201356 % of the xanthine oxidase activity at the concentration of 30 \u03bcg/ml. Extracts of some licorice specimens of types A and B also showed inhibitory effects on monoamine oxidase (44\u201364 % inhibition, at the concentration of 30 \u03bcg/ml), which were slightly weaker than that of harmane hydrochloride. Hatano et al. (1991b) isolated two new phenolic compounds glicoricone and licofuranone together with echinatin, genistein and licopyranocoumarin from a licorice species imported from the north-western region of China. Chinese G. glabra root was found to contain the highest levels of glycyrrhizic acid, followed by those from Italy (Calabria) (Montoro et al. 2011). G. uralensis was found to contain quercetin but G. glabra did not (Liao et al. 2012). Fifteen bioactive components were found in both species. G. glabra provided by Brion Research Institute of Taiwan contained uralsaponin B, but G. glabra brought from herbal shops did not. The following mono- and di-prenylated flavonoids were extracted from the 70 % aqueous- ethanol, ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts of Glycyrrhiza glabra roots (Simons et al. 2009): liquiritin apioside, liquiritin, glabrol, 3-hydroxy-glabrol, isoliquiritin apioside, lichochalone B, glycyrrhizinic acid, glabrene, formononetin, glabrone, glabridin, 3\u2032-hydroxy-4\u2032-O-methylglabridin, 4\u2032O-methylglabridin, hispaglabridin A and hispaglabridin B. Khalaf et al. (2012) found phenol carboxylic acids were present in larger quantities than flavonoids in G. glabra tincture. p-Coumaric acid, ferulic acid, luteolin and apigenin were found and quantified in both hydrolysed and unhydrolysed samples. Kaempferol, fisetin, myricetin, hyperoside, quercitrin, isoquercitrin and rutoside could not be found in the analysed samples. Regarding the phytoestrogens content, significant quantities of ononin and its aglycone formononetin were detected. Among sterols, the largest amount recovered in the tincture was \u03b2-sitosterol and the smallest ergosterol.",

Drought stress was found to enhance the levels of secondary metabolites and key gene expression involved in the biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins in liquorice (Nasrollahi et al. 2014). Due to osmotic stress, the gene expression levels of squalene synthase (SQS) and \u03b2-amyrin synthase (bAS) were increased, whereas those of cycloartenol synthase (CAS) were relatively unchanged at the seedling stage. At the adult plant stage, the expression levels of SQS and bAS were increased under drought stress conditions, whereas the gene expression level of CAS remained relatively constant. The glycyrrhizin content in stolons was increased only under severe drought stress conditions (28 days).",

The green parts of the plant were shown to contain no glycyrrhizinic acid. Enzymatic hydrolysis of glycyrrhizinic acid with \u03b2-glucuronidase afforded the monoglucuronide of \u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid as intermediate. Biosynthetic studies with licorice roots showed that acetate was specifically incorporated into the aglycone moiety of the triterpene saponin and glucuronic acid mainly in the sugar moiety of the diglucuronide, respectively. Glycyrrhizin was found to be localized exclusively in the woody parts of thickened roots but not in the leaf, seed, stem, rootlets, or root nodules while soyasaponins were detected in all parts of the plants examined, and the contents were higher in the seeds, rootlets and root nodules than in other parts (Hayashi et al. 1988, 1993a, 2004, Hayashi 2009). The contents of soyasaponins were higher in younger parts of a growing stolon, whereas those of glycyrrhizin tended to be higher in the older parts. As the primary roots grew and became thicker, the soyasaponin content tended to decrease, while the glycyrrhizin content increased. On the other hand, betulinic acid was localized to the rootlets, root nodules and the cork layer of thickening roots (Hayashi et al. 1988, 2004). Since both soyasaponins and betulinic acid were produced in the rootlets, root nodules and cultured cells, the triterpenoid metabolism of the cultured licorice cells was similar to that of the rootlets and root nodules, whereas glycyrrhizin was detected exclusively in the thickening root and the stolon (Hayashi et al. 1993a). An inverse relationship was found between the soyasaponins content and the glycyrrhizin content in the growing stolon and in the roots at different stages of growth. The glycyrrhizin content in 1-year-old roots rapidly increased from October to November, whereas the isoliquiritigenin glycoside content increased up to October (Hayashi et al. 1998a). In 3-year-old plants, although the isoliquiritigenin glycoside content rapidly increased from June to July, the glycyrrhizin content did not show any significant increase from May to August. The glycyrrhizin content increased during the senescence of the aerial parts as well as during the early stage of shoot elongation. The incorporation of [14C]mevalonic acid into the glycyrrhizin fraction by the root segments was high in May, June and September, and low in August and winter",

Isomucronulatol was produced on inoculation with Helminthosporium carbonum. A new prenylated flavanone named licoflavanone was isolated, together with pinocembrin, from Glycyrrhiza glabra var. typica leaves (Fukui et al. 1988). Upon treatment with methanolic HCl, it was converted to cyclolicoflavanone. Coumarins xanthotoxin (8-methoxy(furano-7,6:2\u2032,3\u2032)coumarin) and bergapten (5-methoxy(furano-7,6:2\u2032,3\u2032)coumarin) were isolated from G. glabra leaves (Saleh et al. 1989). Flavonoids genistein, pinocembrin, prunetin, 6-prenylnaringenin, licoflavanone and wighteone were isolated from the leaves of Glycyrrhiza glabra collected on the west coast of Anatolia, whereas lupiwighteone was found only in the leaves of G. glabra growing in middle or east Anatolia (Hayashi et al. 1996d). Large amounts of flavonoids such as pinocembrin and licoflavanone were present on the outer surface of the young leaves, whereas isoquercitrin, a common flavonoid glycoside, was detected inside the leaves (Hayashi et al. 1996a). 7-O-Methylglabranin, 6-C-prenylpinocembrin, glabranin, pinocembrin, galangin and a novel isoflavonoid, (E)-5,7,4\u2032-trihydroxy-6-(3-hydroxymethyl-2-butenyl)isoflavone (glabrisoflavone) were isolated from the aerial parts of Glycyrrhiza glabra (Yuldashev et al. 2000a). A new flavanonglycoside pinocembroside, 2(S)-7-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl-5-hydroxyflavanone, was isolated from the aerial part of Glycyrrhiza glabra (Yuldashev 2001).

The structures of the three compounds were determined to be 3-O-\u03b2-d-glucuronopyranosyl-24-hydroxy-18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid; 3-O-\u03b2-d-glucuronopyranosyl-18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid and 3-O-\u03b2-d-glucuronopyranosyl-18\u03b2-liquiritic acid. Six major constituents were isolated from enzymatically modified licorice extract: glycyrrhizin (major sweet constituent, 1), 3-O-[\u03b2-d-glucuronopyranosyl-(1 \u2192 2)-\u03b2-d-glucuronopyranosyl] liquiritic acid (minor sweet component 2) and their derivatives glucosylated at the C-4 position of the terminal glucuronopyranose with additional one (compounds 3 and 4, respectively) and two (compounds 5 and 6, respectively) glucose moieties (Liu et al. 2000). Compound 2 was sweeter than compound 1. Compound 3, a monoglucosylated derivative of compound 1, was sweeter than compound 4. Compounds 5 and 6, with two additional glucose moieties, showed only slight sweetness.",

The major leaf flavonol glycoside of G. glabra collected in Turkey, Italy and Spain was isoquercitrin (IQ), but that collected in Kazakhstan was rutin (RT) (Hayashi et al. 2003b). In addition to these, the three flavanones, pinocembrin, licoflavanone and glabranin, were recognized as major compounds common to both types. G. glabra and G. uralensis were found growing together forming a mixed population, and intermediate-type plants between them were at three sites in Kazakhstan (Hayashi et al. 2003b). Although two nucleotide substitutions of the chloroplast rbcL gene were observed between G. uralensis and G. glabra, rbcL sequences of the intermediate-types were divided into G. uralensis -type (G-A type) and G. glabra-type (A-T type). Roots of G. glabra contained glabridin and no glycoumarin while that of G. uralensis glycycoumarin and no glabridin, but neither flavonoid was detected in underground parts of the intermediate-types. All three types contained glycyrrhizin, the rbcL genes for G. glabra plants having linear-oblong leaflets, and straight fruits from the three collection sites were identified as the A-T type sequence (G. glabra-type), and those of G. uralensis plants, having ovate leaflets and falcated fruits, were the G-A type sequence (G. uralensis-type). Leaves of G. glabra contained rutin, isoquercitrin, licoflavanone and pinocembrin, while G. uralensis contained rutin, isoquercitrin, 2 unidentified compounds and no licoflavanone and pinocembrin. Both G. glabra-specific and G. uralensis-specific compounds were detected in the leaves of the intermediate-type, thus suggesting that the intermediate plants were hybrids of G. glabra and G. uralensis.",

In Uzbekistan, HPLC analysis of the underground parts (root, stolon) of G. glabra indicated that glycyrrhizin contents varied from 3.3 to 6.1 % of dry weight, and that glabridin, a species-specific flavonoid for G. glabra, was detected in all underground samples (0.08\u20130.35 % of dry weight). All the G. glabra plants in Sicily and Spain were morphologically similar to each other, and their fruits had no glandular hairs on the capsule (Hayashi et al. 1998b). The glycyrrhizin content in the stolons ranged from 4.4 to 0.7 % of dry weight, and the stolons contained glabridin. A survey of the habitat of Glycyrrhiza glabra in the Mus district of East Anatolia, Turkey, revealed that G. glabra var. glandulifera and G. glabra var. glabra grew together forming a mixed population (Tabata et al. 1988). No significant morphological difference was observed between these two varieties except that the former had glandular hairs on the capsule. The glycyrrhizin content of the roots of these plants bearing fruits in early August was found to be from 0.6 to 3.5 % dw (dry weight), while that in the roots collected in spring in the same region was 3.0\u20136.1 % dw. In another study, HPLC analysis of leaves indicated a significant difference in the chemical composition between the G. glabra plants growing in the west and those in the other regions in Turkey (Hayashi et al. 1995). Pinocembrin (o.18\u20131.5 % dw), licoflavone 0.07\u20130.79 % dw and three unidentified compounds were found in the leaves. Root and stolon of all samples contained glabridin (0.15\u20130.70 % dw) and glycyrrhizin contents (1.1 to 8.0 % of dw). Nine samples of Glycyrrhiza glabra were collected in various sites of Calabria, Italy, which showed remarkable differences in chemical composition and biological activity (Statti et al. 2004).",

            "text": "The metabolites detected in licorice (G. glabra) single cell suspension culture included a volatile apple aroma, a polysaccharide pectin-like material, steroids and triterpenoids (Wu et al. 1974). The analyses of the licorice cell volatile apple aroma indicated the presence of ethanol and some related esters. The monosaccharides found in the pectin-like polysaccharide hydrolysate were glucose, fructose, galactose, arabinose, xylose, galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid. Glycyrrhizinic acid, the common licorice constituent found in the root, could not be detected in the suspension cultures. However, several other related compounds which gave typical steroid and triterpenoid reactions were found. Sorbitol, glucose and fructose were found to be the three major sugars which accumulated in free form in the licorice cell medium. Callus and cell suspension cultures of Glycyrrhiza glabra failed to produce detectable amounts of glycyrrhizin, the major oleanane-type triterpene glycoside of the thickening root, or of its 11-deoxoderivative (Hayashi et al. 1988). However, betulinic acid, a lupane-type triterpene, which was found in the root bark, and a small amount of \u03b2-amyrin, a possible precursor of oleanane-type triterpenes, were detected in cell suspension cultures in addition to lupeol, a fundamental form of lupane-type triterpenes. The biotransformation of papaverine with cell suspension cultures of G. glabra was not reported by Dorisse et al. (1988). The main metabolite of the transformation was a hydroxylated compound, papaverinol. G. glabra suspension cultures did not accumulate either glycyrrhizin of glycyrrhetic acid but did produce the isoflavonoid formononetin (Arias-Castro et al. 1993). The initial pH, sucrose concentrations, medium composition, auxin and cytokinins were found to affect the accumulation of formononetin. Mousa et al. (2007) reported regenerative callus and cell suspension system of licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) to be a prerequisite for the production of the sweetener glycyrrhizin in cell suspension.",

The soyasaponin content in the licorice cell cultures varied from 0.017 to 1.1 % of the dry weight of cells depending on culture strains and was also greatly influenced by plant growth hormones. Two biotransformation products formed from 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid by cell suspension cultures of Glycyrrhiza glabra were isolated and their structures determined as 3-O-[\u03b1-l-arabinopyranosyl-(1 \u2192 2)-\u03b2-d-glucuronopyranosyl]-24-hydroxy-18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid and 30-O-\u03b2-d-glycopyranosyl-18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (Hayashi et al. 1990a). The structures of seven triterpenoid metabolites including new compounds, 3-O-\u03b2-d-glucuronopyranosyl-24-hydroxy-18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid and 24-hydroxy-18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid 30-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl ester, derived from exogenous 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid administered to glycyrrhizin-free cell suspension cultures of Glycyrrhiza glabra, were determined (Hayashi et al. 1992a). 18\u03b2-Glycyrrhetinic acid 24-hydroxylase activity was detected in the microsomal fraction prepared from Glycyrrhiza glabra cell suspension cultures (Hayashi et al. 1993b). Cultured cells of G. glabra produced no detectable amount of glabridin, liquiritigenin glycosides, isoliquiritigenin glycosides, pinocembrin, licoflavanone and isoquercitrin but produced formononetin, an isoflavonoid (Hayashi et al. 1996b). Distribution of soyasaponin and betulinic acid triterpenoids was reported to be different in the intact plant of G. glabra (Hayashi et al. 1993a). Betulinic acid (0.01\u20130.17 %) was detected in all the callus cultures derived from various organs (hypocotyl, root, stem and leaf) of 1-month-old G. glabra seedlings. The presence of stigmasterol (0.04\u20130.07 % of cell dry weight), sitosterol (0.06\u20130.12 %) and small amounts of \u03b2-amyrin and lupeol were also detected. Both substrates [1- 14C]acetate and [2-14C]mevalonate labelled \u03b2-amyrin, an oleanane-type triterpene, and cycloartenol and 24-methylenecycloartanol, both intermediates of phytosterol biosynthesis in plant organs and tissue cultures of Glycyrrhiza glabra var. glandulifera (Ayabe et al. 1990). The label in esterified triterpenes was distributed mainly in phytosterol intermediates, but not in \u03b2-amyrin. The ratio of \u03b2-amyrin formation among the three triterpenes from [2- 14C]mevalonate was relatively high in stolon segments and in root cultures, but negligible in callus cultures. Administration of a specific inhibitor of squalene-2, 3-epoxide:cycloartenol (lanosterol) cyclase caused a marked increase of \u03b2-amyrin synthesis in root suspension cultures, and of 24-methylenecycloartanol synthesis in cell suspension cultures, from [2- 14C]mevalonate. Echinatin and glabridin were isolated from G. glabra callus tissues (Oda et al. 1995)",

            "text": "UDP-glucuronic acid:triterpene glucuronosyltransferase activities for soyasapogenol B, soyasapogenol C, 24-hydroxyglycyrrhetinic acid and 24-hydroxyglycyrrhetinic acid methyl ester were detected in cultured licorice cells (Hayashi et al. 1996c). The pH dependency of the activity for soyasapogenol B was different from that for 24-hydroxyglycyrrhetinic acid methyl ester. Hayashi et al. (1996a) isolated two cDNAs (GgSQS1 and GgSQS2) encoding squalene synthase of Glycyrrhiza glabra by cross-hybridization with that of Arabidopsis thaliana squalene synthase. Their nucleotide sequences contained an open reading frame for a polypeptide of 413 amino acids (GgSQS1) and 412 amino acids (GgSQS2), respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence of GgSQS1 exhibits 88 %, 81 %, 78 %, 45\u201344 % and 45\u201341 % identity to those of the GgSQS2, Nicotiana benthamiana, Arabidopsis thaliana, mammal, and yeast squalene synthases, respectively. The cell-free extracts of E.coli transformed with the respective plasmid converted 3H-farnesyl diphosphate into squalene. Two cDNAs (GgSQS1 and GgSQS2) encoding squalene synthase were isolated from licorice, Glycyrrhiza glabra (Hayashi et al. 1999). Squalene synthase activity was found in the cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli transformed with the recombinant plasmids for GgSQS1 and GgSQS2, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that GgSQS2 mRNA was mainly expressed during the exponential growth phase of the cultured licorice cells. A cDNA clone (GgCAS1) encoding cycloartenol synthase (CAS) was isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra by cross-hybridization with that of Pisum sativum CAS as a probe (Hayashi et al. 2000a). Southern blot analysis suggested that at least two CAS genes exist in the licorice genome. An oxidosqualene cyclase cDNA, termed GgbAS1, was isolated from cultured cells of Glycyrrhiza glabra by heterologous hybridization with cDNA of Arabidopsis thaliana LUP1 lupeol synthase (Hayashi et al. 2001). It was shown that the level of \u03b2-amyrin synthase mRNA was drastically changed in the cultured licorice cells, whereas the mRNA level of cycloartenol synthase was relatively constant. Exogenously applied methyl jasmonate (MeJA) stimulated soyasaponin biosynthesis in cultured Glycyrrhiza glabra cells (Hayashi et al. 2003c). mRNA level and enzyme activity of \u03b2-amyrin synthase (bAS), an oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) situated at the branching point for oleanane-type triterpene saponin biosynthesis, were upregulated by MeJA, whereas those of cycloartenol synthase, an OSC involved in sterol biosynthesis, were relatively constant. Two mRNAs of squalene synthase (SQS), an enzyme common to both triterpene and sterol biosyntheses, were also upregulated by MeJA. In addition, enzyme activity of UDP-glucuronic acid: soyasapogenol B glucuronosyltransferase, an enzyme situated at a later step of soyasaponin biosynthesis, was also upregulated by MeJA. Accumulations of bAS and two SQS mRNAs were not transient but lasted for 7 days after exposure to MeJA, resulting in the high-level accumulation (more than 2 % of dry weight cells) of soyasaponins in cultured licorice cells. The cultured cells and intact plants of Glycyrrhiza glabra produced betulinic acid and oleanane-type triterpene saponins (soyasaponins and glycyrrhizin) (Hayashi et al. 2004). They found that the mRNA expression levels of lupeol synthase and \u03b2-amyrin synthase were consistent with the accumulation of betulinic acid and oleanane-type triterpene saponins, respectively. The transcript of lupeol synthase was highly expressed in the cultured cells and root nodules. The transcript of \u03b2-amyrin synthase, an OSC responsible for oleanane-type triterpene biosynthesis, was highly expressed in the cultured cells, root nodules and germinating seeds, where soyasaponin accumulated, and in the thickened roots where glycyrrhizin accumulated. Yeast extract promoted betulinic acid accumulation in cultured cells of G. glabra whereas soyasaponin accumulation was suppressed (Hayashi et al. 2005). The results indicated that soyasaponin and betulinic acid production were differently regulated in cultured cells of G. glabra. Differential pathway of soyasaponin and betulinic acid production in G. glabra were proposed as follows:acetyl-CoA \u2192 mevalonic acid \u2192 squalene \u2192 squalene-2,3-epoxide \u2192 \u03b2-amyrin \u2192 glycyrrhetinic acid \u2192 glycyrrhizin;acetyl-CoA \u2192 mevalonic acid \u2192 squalene \u2192 squalene-2,3-epoxide \u2192 \u03b2-amyrin \u2192 soyasapogenol B \u2192 Soyasaponin I (R = galactose) and soyasaponin II (R = arabinose)acetyl-CoA \u2192 mevalonic acid \u2192 squalene \u2192 squalene-2,3-epoxide \u2192 lupeol \u2192 betulinic acid;acetyl-CoA \u2192 mevalonic acid \u2192 squalene \u2192 squalene-2,3-epoxide \u2192 cycloartenol \u2192 \u03b2-sitosterol.\n",

Licorice had been reported to possesses many therapeutic properties as to potentiate the action of cortisol, to reduce testosterone synthesis, especially in women, to exert an estrogen-like activity and to reduce body fat mass (Armanini et al. 2002). Licorice flavonoid constituents mainly comprised flavones, flavonals, isoflavones, chalcones, bihydroflavones and bihydrochalcones (Xing et al. 2003). Pharmacological investigation concluded that they had antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-tumour and anti-HIV activities. Glycyrrhiza Radix is a commonly used Chinese herbal medicine, derived from the dried roots and rhizomes of Glycyrrhiza uralensis, G. glabra and G. inflata (Gao et al. 2009). The main bioactive constituents of licorice comprised triterpene saponins and flavonoids. Various pharmacological properties of liquorice had been reported including anti-ulcer, anti-inflammation, spasmolysis, anti-oxidative, contravariance, antiviral, anticancer activities, hepatoprotective, expectorant and memory enhancing effects. Glabridin, a prenylated isoflavonoid of G. glabra roots had been associated with a wide range of biological properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, regulation of energy metabolism, estrogenic, neuroprotective, anti-osteoporotic and skin-whitening (Simmler et al. 2013). While glabridin is one of the most studied licorice flavonoids, both glabridin and standardized licorice extracts have significant impact on food, dietary supplements (DSs) and cosmetic markets, as evidenced by the amount of available patents and scientific articles since 1976, when glabridin was first described.",

The bioassay-directed chemical investigation of both licorices revealed glabrene, glabridin and licochalcones A and B as active principles. Glabrene showed most potent antioxidant, three times as potent as vitamin E, glabridin showed no significant activity. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of G. uralensis and G. glabra achieved approximately 72\u201375 % if 10 mg/mL or more licorice extract was used (Liao et al. 2012). G. uralensis had slightly better radical scavenging activity than G. glabra. G. uralensis also showed higher reducing ability than G. glabra. Cheel et al. (2013) found that the chemical profile of licorice quantitatively varied at different harvest times and these fluctuations determined changes in its bioactivities such as antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities. In general, the samples from May and November showed the most favourable free radical scavenging and antioxidant effects. Liquiritin and glycyrrhizin, the major constituents in the February and May licorice extract, appeared to contribute to the superoxide radical scavenging activity. Glabridin and glabrene, the compounds with the highest relative proportion in the November licorice extract, accounted for the antioxidant and DPPH scavenging activities of licorice.",

The isolated compounds were identified as the isoflavans hispaglabridin A (1), hispaglabridin B (4), glabridin (3) and 4\u2032-O-methylglabridin (2), the two chalcones, isoprenylchalcone derivative (5) and isoliquiritigenin (6), and the isoflavone, formononetin (7). The isoflavans (1\u20134) at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM inhibited \u03b2-carotene consumption, following 90 min of incubation at 50 \u00b0C, similar to the inhibitory effect of the whole licorice crude extract (at 16 mg/l). The chalcones (5 and 6) exhibited moderate inhibition and the isoflavone 7 was almost inactive, whereas vitamin E (50 \u03bcM) completely inhibited \u03b2-carotene consumption. Compounds 1\u20136 exhibited high inhibitory activity at a concentration of 30 \u03bcM on 2,2\u2032-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced LDL oxidation, but compound 7 and vitamin E were not active. A dose-dependent inhibitory effect of glabridin, on the formation of cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxide (CLOOH), in an AAPH-induced LDL oxidation system was also shown. Glabridin, at 5 or 40\u201360 \u03bcM concentration, inhibited the CLOOH formation by 62 % and 90 %, respectively. The results suggested that constituents 1\u20136 were very potent antioxidants toward LDL oxidation with glabridin (11.6 % wet weight) being the most abundant and potent antioxidant.",

After 3 months, at 25 \u00b0C and 45, the extract demonstrated more antioxidant activity than from two other commercial antioxidants at all concentrations, with about 43\u201353 % and 34\u201346 %, respectively, more hydroquinone remaining than in the control system.

Further, both extracts showed strong reducing power and iron-chelating capacities. In the Fe2+/ascorbate system, both extracts were found to inhibit mitochondrial fraction lipid peroxidation. In copper-catalysed human serum and low-density lipoprotein oxidation models, both extracts significantly lengthened the lag phase along with a decline in the oxidation rate, conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance formation.

Mitochondrial lipid peroxidation linked to respiratory electron transport and that induced non-enzymatically were inhibited by these isoflavans. Hispaglabridin A strongly inhibited both peroxidations and 3\u2032-hydroxy-4\u2032-O-methylglabridin was the most effective at preventing NADH-dependent peroxidation. 3\u2032-Hydroxy-4\u2032-O-methylglabridin protected mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities against NADPH-dependent peroxidation injury. Dihydroxyfumarate-induced mitochondrial peroxidation was also prevented by this isoflavan. At the concentration of 0.10, 0.25 and 0. 5 mg/mL, licorice glabridin inhibited microsomal free radical (ROS) formation by 67 %, 73 % and 83 %, respectively (Ablise et al. 2007). At lower concentration, the ROS inhibitory activity of glabridin was the same with those of Ginkgo biloba extract EGB761. Administration of Glycyrrhiza glabra polysaccharides (GGP) dose-dependently and significantly enhanced immune and antioxidant enzyme activities in the GGP-treated high-fat mice (Hong et al. 2009). Glycyrrhiza glabra root samples irradiated with 20 and 25 kGy doses gamma irradiation as a method of decontamination for food and herbal materials, increased phenolic contents and DPPH scavenging activity (Khattak and Simpson 2010). Licorice infusion weakly scavenged DPPH, and its compounds liquiritin and glycyrrhizin showed negligible effects (Cheel et al. 2010). Both licorice infusion and glycyrrhizin substantially scavenged superoxide radicals. The \u03b2-carotene bleaching was inhibited by licorice infusion, but liquiritin and glycyrrhizin showed no effect. The licorice infusion, liquiritin and glycyrrhizin exhibited no meaningful activities against hypochlorous acid, and they showed pro-oxidant effects in the myeloperoxidase-chlorinating system.",

Encapsulation efficiencies for liquiritigenin and liquiritin-loaded liposome-in-hydrogel were 69.39 % and 64.71 %, respectively. Liposome-in-hydrogel complex systems (LQG: 56.55 %, LQ: 66.99 %) had greater skin permeability than control (LQG: 4.92 %, LQ: 5.30 %) or a single liposome systems (LQG: 43.34 %, LQ: 48.97 %) and hydrogel systems (LQG: 38.21 %, LQ: 55.07 %). Liposome-in-hydrogel system could be a potential drug delivery system for topical delivery of antioxidants such as licorice flavonoids to construct antioxidative skin barrier. Licorice had been shown to have antioxidant properties and may play a role in the treatment and prevention of photo-ageing and a natural ingredient used in cosmetics (Bowe and Pugliese 2014). When licorice extract (LE) was also used in emulsion preparation, a remarkable synergistic oxidation inhibition was observed with pea protein hydrolysates (PPH) (Zhang et al. 2013, 2014\nb). Remarkable synergistic effects were observed on both Flavourzyme (Fla-PPH) or Protamex (Pro-PPH) with licorice extract (LE) (Zhang et al. 2013). The presence of LE enhanced the antioxidant potential by producing a more compact network apparently via PPH-LE complexation. LE adsorbed onto oil droplets either directly or through associating with PPH to produce a thick and compact interfacial membrane enabling the defence against oxygen species (Zhang et al. 2014\nb). Liquiritin apioside, neolicuroside, glabrene and 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetic acid were the predominant phenolic derivatives partitioning at the interface and most likely the major contributors to the notable synergistic antioxidant activity when coupled with pea protein hydrolysates.",

            "text": "Studies by Kobayashi et al. (1995) showed that the anti-angiogenic effect of licorice extract depended on the anti-tube formation effect of isoliquiritin. Isoliquiritin (0.31\u20133.1 mg/kg), a licorice-derived flavonoid, inhibited the carmine content of granuloma tissue 50-fold greater than licorice extract (Kobayashi et al. 1995). Glycyrrhizin (20\u201380 mg/kg), a licorice-derived saponin, inhibited carmine content with a weak potency. The licorice extract (0.01\u20131 mg/ml) also inhibited tube formation from vascular endothelial cells in a concentration-dependent manner. From the chemical structure-activities of used licorice-derived flavonoids (0.1\u2013100 \u03bcM), their potencies for anti-tube formation were in the order isoliquiritigenin > isoliquiritin > liquiritigenin > > isoliquiritin-apioside. Glycyrrhizin (0.1\u2013100 \u03bcM) and glycyrrhetinic acid (0.1\u201310 \u03bcM) increased tube formation. A glycyrrhizin (82 \u03bcg/ml)-induced increase in tube formation was inhibited by isoliquiritin. The combined effect of a mixture of 82 \u03bcg/ml glycyrrhizin and 4.2 \u03bcg/ml isoliquiritin, a similar concentration ratio to their yield ratio in the licorice extract, corresponded to the effect of 100 \u03bcg/ml extract. Various extracts of G. glabra and its constituents were found to be cytotoxic in-vitro (Rathi et al. 2009). The IC50 values of standard 18 \u03b2-glycyrrhetic acid was 0.412 \u03bcM and those for the three different extracts (chloroform, methanol and water) of G. glabra on MCF7 cancerous cell line were 0.4485, 0.9906 and 1.288 \u03bcM, respectively. HPTLC study indicated that the amount of 18 \u03b2-glycyrrhetic acid in three different extracts (chloroform, methanol and water extract) was 26.6, 12.5 and 5.6 \u03bcg/g, respectively. Glycyrrhiza extract exhibited antiangiogenic activity in the zebrafish antiangiogenic model (Li 2012). Of seven fraction form the ethyl acetate extract, Fr5 and Fr6 showed antiangiogenic activity. Results of studies suggested that licorice root extract could mitigate the tumorigenic effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a endocrine disrupting chemical in MCF-7 cell breast cancer cells by suppression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), AhR nuclear translocator and cytochrome P450 1A1 in a dose-dependent manner and cell cycle arrest (Chu et al. 2014). Thus, licorice could be used as a potential toxicity-alleviating agent against endocrine disrupting chemical-mediated diseases.",

            "text": "Glycyrrhetic acid inhibited the action of tumour promoter in-vitro and in-vivo (Nishino et al. 1984). Glycyrrhetic acid inhibited the increased phospholipid metabolism of cultured cells induced by tumour promoters, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or teleocidin, and it markedly suppressed the promoting effect of teleocidin on skin tumour formation in mice initiated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene. Application of glycyrrhetic acid, to Swiss 3 T3 mouse fibroblasts prior to the treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent tumour promoter, showed a time- and dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the TPA-stimulated 3-O-methyl-glucose transport (Kitagawa et al. 1984). Glycyrrhetic acid inhibited the specific binding of TPA to mouse epidermal membrane fractions in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Kitagawa et al. 1986). Glycyrrhizic acid, a glycoside of glycyrrhetic acid, exerted no inhibitory effect on TPA binding. The results of kinetic analysis suggested that glycyrrhetic acid directly bound to the TPA receptor, resulting in the competitive inhibition of the binding of TPA to its receptor without affecting the number of binding sites. The authors suggested that the inhibitory effect of glycyrrhetic acid on TPA binding to the membrane receptor may play a role in its antitumor-promoting activity in-vivo. Glycyrrhetic acid an anti-inflammatory agent isolated from licorice root inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-mediated tumour promotion in mouse skin (O\u2019Brian et al. 1990). It was demonstrated that glycyrrhetic acid inhibited the Ca2+-and phospholipid-dependent phosphotransferase activity of protein kinase C (PKC), the phorbol ester tumour promoter receptor. Therefore, inhibition of PKC may play a role in the anti-promoting activity of glycyrrhetic acid.",

Also it was shown that HUVEC tube formation was drastically reduced when cultured in conditioned medium of AGA-treated DU-145 cells. Additionally, AGA treatment prevented the invasion of DU-145 prostate cancer cells on matrigel coated transwells via downregulation of NF-\u03baB (p65), VEGF and MMP-9 expression. Further, AGA treatment also downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine/growth factor genes HMGB1, IL-6 and IL-8 in DU-145 cells. The results suggested that AGA may be a promising anticancer agent for the chemoprevention and treatment of prostate cancer. Non-polar compounds in the ethanol extract of roasted licorice (EERL) exerted potent anti-carcinogenic effects in inhibiting the growth of DU145 and MLL prostate cancer cells, as well as HT-29 colon cancer cells (Park et al. 2014a, b). In contrast aqueous extracts of un-roasted and roasted licorice showed minimal effects on cell growth. EERL potently inhibited growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast, B16-F10 melanoma, and A375 and A2058 skin cancer cells, whereas EERL slightly stimulated the growth of normal IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells and CCD118SK fibroblasts.",

The related compounds 18-\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid and carbenoxolone also caused communication inhibition. Glycyrrhetinic acid was shown previously to inhibit intercellular gap-junctional communication between human fibroblasts (Davidson and Baumgarten 1988). Of 31 derivatives of glycyrrhetinic acid tested for their ability to inhibit communication, eight of the compounds inhibited communication with high potency (IC50 less than 3 \u03bcM) and showed low toxicity, properties which suggested they may be useful pharmacological probes for studies of gap-junction function. Endogenous and exogenous factors which modulate intercellular gap-junctional communication may be efficiently used to prevent potential cancer cells deviating from normal cell society and homeostasis (Yamasaki 1990). 2-cyano substituted analogues of glycyrrhetinic acid, namely, methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18\u03b2-olean-1,12-dien-30-oate (\u03b2-CDODA-Me) and methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18\u03b1-olean-1,12-dien-30-oate (\u03b1-CDODA-Me) were found to be more cytotoxic to colon cancer cells (SW480, HT-29, HCT-15) than their des-cyano analogues and to have selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonist activity (Chintharlapalli et al. 2007). This selectivity in colon cancer cells was shown for the induction of two proapoptotic proteins, namely, caveolin-1 and the tumour-suppressor gene Kr\u00fcppel-like factor-4 (KLF-4). The data suggested that PPARgamma agonists derived from glycyrrhetinic acid induced cell-dependent caveolin-1 and KLF-4 expression through receptor-dependent pathways.",

            "text": "Glycyrrhetinic acid, the metabolite of the natural product glycyrrhizin, had been found to be a nonselective inhibitor of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD) type 1 and type 2 (Stanetty et al. 2010). 11\u03b2-HSD2 inhibitors may find therapeutic applications in chronic inflammatory diseases and certain forms of cancer, whereas 11\u03b2-HSD1 inhibitors may find use for treatment of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Several 3-amino and 29-hydroxamic acid derivatives of glycyrrhetinic acid (metabolite of glycyrrhizin) were synthesised and showed high selectivity for 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11\u03b2-HSD2) (Stanetty et al. 2010). The most potent and selective compound was active against human 11\u03b2-HSD2 in the low nanomolar range with a 350-fold selectivity over human 11\u03b2-HSD1. Kratschmar et al. (2011) found selected 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives potently inhibited 11\u03b2-HSD2 in intact SW-620 colon cancer cells, although the rank order of inhibitory potential differed from that obtained in cell lysates. The biological activity of compounds was further demonstrated in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transactivation assays in cells co-expressing GR and 11\u03b2-HSD1 or 11\u03b2-HSD2. Earlier novel 18\u03b2a-glycyrrhetinic acid analogues, 7 N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3\u03b2-hydroxy-11-oxo-18\u03b2-olean-12-en-30-oic acid amide (Su et al. 2004) and 5, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3\u03b2-hydroxy-11-oxo-18\u03b2-olean-12-en-30-oic acid amide (Vicker et al. 2004) were found to be very potent selective inhibitors of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 with IC50 values of 4pM. Gaware et al. (2011) described novel 29-urea- and 29-hydroxamic acid derivatives of glycyrrhetinic acid as well as derivatives with the Beckman rearrangement of the 3-oxime to a seven-membered ring, and the rearrangement of the C-ring from 11-keto-12-ene to 12-keto-9(11)-ene to have improved selective inhibition of 11\u03b2-HSD2 in the lower nanomolar range with up to 3600-fold selectivity. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) significantly suppressed the viability of NCI-H460 and A549 non-small lung cancer cells in-vitro (Song et al. 2014). Also, GA significantly increased the sub G1 population by cell cycle analysis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) positive cells in a concentration dependent manner in NCI-H460 non-small lung cancer cells. The results suggested that GA induced apoptosis via inhibition of PKC \u03b1/\u03b2II and activation of JNK in NCI-H460 non-small lung cancer cells. 18\u03b2-Glycyrrhetinic acid (18\u03b2-GA) suppressed cell proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer by inhibiting thromboxane synthase and its ERK/CREB signalling (Huang et al. 2014).",

            "text": "Isoliquiritigenin, one of the components in the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra, significantly inhibited the proliferation of DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (Kanazawa et al. 2003). Isoliquiritigenin induced S and G2/M phase arrest and enhanced the expression of GADD153 mRNA and protein associated with cell cycle arrest. Licochalcone from G. glabra roots inhibited growth and induced modest apoptosis of androgen-independent p53-null PC-3 prostate cancer cells but had more pronounced effect on cell cycle progression arresting cells in G2/M, accompanied by suppression of cyclin B1 and cdc2 (Fu et al. 2004). It also inhibited phosphorylation of Rb and decreased expression of transcription factor E2F concurrent with reduction of cyclin D1, downregulation of CDKs 4 and 6, but increased cyclin E expression. Kwon et al. (2009) found that isoliquiritigenin inhibited migration, and the metastatic and invasive capacity of human prostate cancer DU 145 cells possibly by decreasing Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activator protein (AP)-1 signalling. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a flavonoid isolated from licorice, inhibited human promyelocytic leukaemia (HL-60) cell proliferation and decreased the iROS levels in a dose-dependent manner, while the treatment did not increase the lethality rate (Li et al. 2009). Isoliquiritigenin (ISL) triggered the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent autophagic and apoptotic cell death in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) (Chen et al. 2012). The results suggested that induction of mTOR-dependent autophagic and apoptotic cell death may be an important mechanism in cancer chemotherapy by ISL. Wang et al. (2013\nc) found that isoliquiritigenin (ISL) significantly inhibited the VEGF-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at non-toxic concentration. A series of angiogenesis processes including tube formation, invasion and migration abilities of HUVECs were also interrupted by ISL in-vitro (Wang et al. 2013b). Additionally, ISL suppressed sprout formation from VEGF-treated aortic rings in an ex-vivo model. In-vivo studies further showed that ISL administration could inhibit breast cancer growth and neoangiogenesis accompanying with suppressed VEGF/VEGFR-2 signalling, elevated apoptosis ratio and little toxicity effects. Studies by Kang et al. (2010) demonstrated that isoliquiritigenin blocked JNK- or p38 MAPK-responsive pathways leading to direct matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activation of PMA-exposed endothelial cells. The results suggested that isoliquiritigenin inhibition of MMP may boost a therapeutic efficacy during angiogenesis. Li et al. (2013) found that isoliquiritigenin induced growth inhibition and apoptosis through downregulating multiple key enzymes in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic network and the deactivation of PI3K/Akt in human breast cancer cells. Isoliquiritigenin diminished cell viability, 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, and clonogenic ability in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, isoliquiritigenin inhibited mRNA expression of multiple forms of AA-metabolizing enzymes, including phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenases (COX)-2 and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4A, and decreased secretion of their products, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), without affecting COX-1, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Isoliquiritigenin suppressed the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells by inhibiting upstream signalling pathways (Wang et al. 2013\nc). It reduced the secretions and protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) and also inhibited the expression and gelatinolytic activity of matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 and MMP-9. In another study, isoliquiritigenin inhibited breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell metastasis by preventing anoikis resistance, migration and invasion through downregulating COX-2 and CYP 4A signalling (Zheng et al. 2014). The results suggested that isoliquiritigenin could be a promising multi-target agent for preventing breast cancer metastasis, and anoikis could represent a novel mechanism through which flavonoids may exert the anti-metastatic activities. Licorice flavonoid isoliquiritigenin diminished 7,12-dimethylbenz[\u03b1]anthracene (DMBA)-induced DNA (xenobiotic response element \u2013 XRE) binding of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Wong et al. 2014). Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay demonstrated that expressions of genes with XRE-containing promoters, including CYP1A1, 1A2 and 1B1, followed the same pattern of XRE transactivation. The present study illustrated that isoliquiritigenin might downregulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-induced expressions through antagonizing AhR translocation. Isoliquiritigenin was found to be a promising chemopreventive agent against oral cancer (Hsia et al. 2015). It caused DNA damage and inhibited ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) expression leading to G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma.",

Also microvascular density (MVD) of the tumour exposed to liquiritigenin was reduced in a dose dependent manner, especially in the high dose group. Moreover, the expression and secretion of VEGF were downregulated by liquiritigenin in-vivo and in-vitro. Liquiritigenin markedly reduced cell viability, enhanced apoptotic rate, induced lactate dehydrogenase over-release, and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and caspase 3 activity in both hepatocellular carcinoma PLC/PRL/5 and HepG2 cells (Wang et al. 2014b). It was found that liquiritigenin induced tumour cell death through mitogen-activated protein kinase- (MPAKs-) mediated pathway. This antitumor activity was further confirmed in PLC/PRL/5-xenografted mice model. In another study, liquiritigenin inhibited cell viability, caused G1 phase arrest and initiated apoptosis in both pituitary adenoma MMQ and GH3 cells via Ras/ERKs and ROS-dependent mitochondrial pathways, suggesting it to be a potential suppressor of pituitary adenoma (Wang et al. 2014c).

They found that DBM inhibited the growth of LNCaP, DU145 and PC-3 prostate carcinoma cell lines by induction of cell cycle deregulation. Frazier et al. (2004) investigated the proteomic changes induced by treatment of human prostatic LNCaP cancer cells with DBM in order to develop a model for the mechanism to elucidate how DBM induced cell cycle arrest and repressed androgen receptor expression. Dibenzoylmethane was reported to be a promising chemopreventive agent for colon, breast and skin cancer; it mediated the induction of phase II enzymes by Nrf2 activation and inhibited benzo[a]pyrene induced DNA adducts by enhancing its detoxification in lungs (Thimmulappa et al. 2008). Khor et al. (2009) demonstrated that DBM-fed TRAMP mice had a lower incidence of palpable tumour and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Their findings suggested that DBM blocked the growth and progression of prostate cancer in TRAMP mice via modulation of tumour cell cycle regulation. Dibenzoylmethane (DB), a minor constituent of the root extract of licorice, hydroxydibenzoylmethane and hydroxymethyldibenzoylmethane with an identical structure to DB, inhibited phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate-induced breast carcinoma cell migration and invasion through the protein kinase PI3K/PKC\u03b4-mediated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 pathway (Liao et al. 2015).",

On using the ribose-lysine mutagenic browning mixture, the desmutagenic activities of the Glycyrrhiza glabra extract, glycyrrhizinic acid, 18 \u03b1- and 18 \u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acids were observed. 18 \u03b2-Glycyrrhetinic acid was the most active compound. Glycyrrhiza glabra extract also exhibited antimutagenic activity against ribose-lysine. Glycyrrhiza extract and one of its components, glycyrrhizin, inhibited the mutagenicities of 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5 H-pyrido[4,3-b]-indole (Trp-P-1) and 3-amino-1-methyl-5 H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Tanaka et al. 1987). Glycyrrhiza extract and glycyrrhizin also inhibited the mutagenicities of benzo[a]pyrene, 3-methylcholanthrene, 2-naphthylamine, 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3\u2032,2\u2032-d]-imidazole, dimethylnitrosamine and dimethylaminoazobenzene. The mutagenicity of 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide (AF-2) was inhibited by the Glycyrrhiza extract but not by glycyrrhizin. A standardized licorice extract GutGard\u2122 did not show significant increase in number of revertant colonies in Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA98 and TAMix) with/without S9 fraction (Chandrasekaran et al. 2011\nb). In chromosome aberration and micronucleus studies, GutGard\u2122 did not show clastogenic effect at 4 and 18 h treatments with and without S9 fraction. The results indicated that GutGard\u2122 was not mutagenic in a battery of genotoxicity tests.",

            "text": "The antimutagenic and genoprotective activities of Glycyrrhiza glabra root extracts were demonstrated both on plant test systems \u2013 Allium fistulosum, Allium cepa, Vicia faba and on animals \u2013 Wistar rats (Agabe\u012dli 2012). Various genotoxic studies had indicated that glycyrrhizin was neither teratogenic nor mutagenic, and may possess anti-genotoxic properties under certain conditions (Isbrucker and Burdock 2006). Studies showed that licorice flavonoid oil (LFO) a functional food ingredient appeared not to present any genotoxic hazard to humans on dietary consumption (Nakagawa et al. 2008a) in a reverse mutation assay using four Salmonella typhimurium strains and Escherichia coli, LFO did not increase the number of revertant colonies in any tester strain with or without metabolic activation by rat liver S9 mix. In a chromosomal aberration test using Chinese hamster lung (CHL/IU) cells, LFO did not induce any chromosomal aberrations either in the short period test without rat liver S9 mix or in the continuous treatment (24 or 48 h) test. No significant or dose-dependent increases in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) were observed and the high dose suppressed the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) to total erythrocytes in the bone marrow micronucleus test using male F344 rats. No micronuclei induction either in hepatocytes or PCE was observed even at the highest dose of 5000 mg/kg/day. In-vitro studies found that isoliquiritin apioside, a chalcone oligoglucose isolated from G. glabra exhibited marked potential to combat oxidative stress-induced genotoxicity (Kaur et al. 2009). It exhibited modulatory effect against hydrogen peroxide and 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide induced genotoxicity in Escherichia coli PQ37 using SOS chromotest and in human peripheral blood lymphocytes using the Comet assay. Umbelliferone isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra rhizome exhibited moderate response by reducing the induction factor of mutagens hydrogen peroxide by 68.99 % (IC50 223.44 \u03bcM) and that of 4NQO (4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide) by 59.71 % (IC50 280.74 \u03bcM) in the SOS chromotest using PQ37 strain of Escherichia coli (Kaur et al. 2012a). In comet assay in human blood lymphocytes, it exhibited good activity by inhibiting the genotoxicity of both hydrogen peroxide and 4NQO by 61.64 % (IC50 330.02 \u03bcM) and 50.66 % (IC50 577.83 \u03bcM), respectively. None of licorice leaf (methanol, ethyl acetate and n-hexane) extracts exhibited genotoxic effects in the SOS (short term bacterial) chromotest assay used at doses up to 100ug/assay both in the presence and absence of enzymatic metabolization (Siracusa et al. 2011). Licorice fraction comprising glycyrrhizic acid inhibited the genotoxicity of oxidative mutagens, namely, H2O2 and 4NQO quite efficiently (Kaur et al. 2012b). In SOS chromotest, using Escherichia coli PQ37 tester strain, it inhibited induction factor induced by H2O2 and 4NQO by 75.54 % and 71.69 % at the concentration of 121.46 \u03bcM, respectively. In Comet assay, it reduced the tail moment induced by H2O2 and 4NQO by 70.21 % and 69.04 %, respectively, at the same concentration in human blood lymphocytes. The isolated fraction also exhibited DPPH free radical scavenging activity and was able to scavenge 85.95 % radicals at a concentration of 120 \u03bcM. The results showed glycyrrhizic acid to be a potential modulator of genotoxins as well as efficient scavenger of free radicals. In-vitro study demonstrated that G. glabra extracts protected against cadmium-induced genetic and oxidative damage in human lymphocytes (Dirican and Turkez 2014). Co-application of G. glabra extract (5, 10 and 20 ppm) and CdCl2 resulted in decreases of micronucleus and sister chromatid exchange formations as compared to the group treated with CdCl2 alone.",

Both glycoumarin and licocoumarone inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis as strongly as streptomycin. Both also inhibited yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida utilis and Pichia nakazawae, while streptomycin was inactive (Demizu et al. 1988). Pinocembrin, licoflavanone (from licorice leaves) and its converted product cyclolicoflavanone were weakly active against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, but were inactive against Escherichia coli (Fukui et al. 1988). Glabrene and glabridin, from Russian licorice (G. glabra var. glandulifera) showed potent antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis with IC50 values of 1.95\u20137.81 \u03bcg/ml, yeast \u2013 Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis (IC50 values of 7.81\u201331.3 \u03bcg/ml) and the fungus, Mucor pusillus (IC50 values of 3.91\u201315.6 \u03bcg/ml) (Okada et al. 1989). Seven licorice phenolic compounds showed induction activities of DNA damage in a recombinationless mutant of Bacillus subtilis M45 (Fukai et al. 1998). Glycyrrhiza glabra rhizome extracts exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans in-vitro with MIC values of 1.56 mg/ml (Motsei et al. 2003). Glycyrrhiza glabra rhizome extract exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans in-vitro with MIC values of 1.56 mg/ml (Motsei et al. 2003). G. glabra extracts from samples collected in various sites of Calabria, Italy, exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus and the fungus Trichophyton mentagrophytes, some samples inhibited Pythium ultimum (Statti et al. 2004). The hydroalcoholic extract of G. glabra exhibited antifungal activity in-vitro against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger (Tharkar et al. 2010). The ethanolic extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra showed good antifungal activity in-vitro against Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Mucor sp. and Penicillium marneffei (Geetha and Roy 2013). The in-vitro growth of the Candida albicans strains was markedly reduced, in a pH-dependent manner, by relatively low doses (6.2 \u03bcg/mL) of 18-\u03b2 glycyrrhetinic acid, from Glycyrrhiza glabra root (Pellati et al. 2009). The results demonstrated 18-\u03b2 glycyrrhetinic acid to be a promising biological alternative for the topical treatment of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.",

G. glabra extract at concentration higher than 7.5 % exhibited inhibitory effects in-vitro against Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi B, Shigella sonnei, S. flexneri and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (Shirazi et al. 2007). Antimycobacterial activity of Glycyrrhiza glabra root was found at 500 \u03bcg/mL concentration (Gupta et al. 2008). Bioactivity guided phytochemical analysis identified glabridin as potentially active against both Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra and H37Rv strains at 29.16 \u03bcg/mL concentration. It exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Raw polysaccharides from Glycyrrhiza glabra were shown to have strong anti-adhesive effects against Porphyromonas gingivalis, a major pathogen for induction of periodontal inflammations (Wittschier et al. 2009). Glabridin, from licorice roots, was found to be active against both yeast and filamentous fungi (Fatima et al. 2009). Glabridin also showed resistance modifying activity against drug-resistant mutants of Candida albicans at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 31.25\u2013250 \u03bcg/mL. The vegetative cell growth of Bacillus subtilis was inhibited dose-dependently by licochalcone A and was completely inhibited at a concentration of 3 \u03bcg/ml (Tsukiyama et al. 2002). Licochalcone A did not inhibit the germination of heat-treated spores of B. subtilis induced by l-alanine. Licochalcone A showed effects against all Gram-positive bacteria tested and was especially effective against all Bacillus spp. tested, with MICs of 2\u20133 \u03bcg/ml, but was not effective against Gram-negative bacteria or eukaryotes at 50 \u03bcg/ml. Glabridin and licochalcone A showed antifungal activity on C. albicans while glycyrrhizic acid had no effect (Messier and Grenier 2011). Biofilm formation was inhibited by 35\u201360 % in the presence of licochalcone A (0.2 \u03bc/ml/). A strong inhibitory effect (>80 %) on hyphal formation was observed with licochalcone A or glabridin (100 \u03bcg/ml).",

The ethanolic extract of the leaves was the most active extract against Gram-positive bacteria. Ether, chloroform, acetone extracts of liquorice roots showed significant antibacterial activities against two Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and two Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria (Nitalikar et al. 2010). The hydro-methanolic G. glabra root extract displayed antibacterial activities in-vitro against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis (Varsha et al. 2013). Shigella flexneri was the most sensitive. Aqueous and ethanolic licorice extracts were found to have antimicrobial activity (Ajagannanavar et al. 2014). MIC of aqueous and ethnolic licorice root extract against oral pathogens, Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus were 25 % and 12.5 %, respectively. The methanol licorice root extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity (Chopra et al. 2013). The extract was most potent against Staphylococcus aureus at 500 \u03bcg/mL (inhibition zone 13 mm) among bacteria and showed maximum potency against Rhizopus spp. at 500 \u03bcg/ml (inhibition zone 11 mm) among fungi. It was least active against Aspergillus awamori. Diethyl carbonate extracts of Glycyrrhiza glabra root from Astrakhan region (Russia) exhibited maximum activity against test bacterial strains Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis; activity of Astrakhan licorice was superior among 50 % ethanol extracts from Astrakhan (Russia) and Calabria (Italy) (Astaf\u2019eva and Sukhenko 2014). Antibacterial activity was directly proportional to the content of glycyrrhizin and 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid in the extracts. The content of these chemical components in Glycyrrhiza glabra root from Astrakhan region was higher than in licorice growing in Italy.",

            "text": "Recent research suggested that licorice and its bioactive ingredients such as glycyrrhizin, glabridin, licochalcone A, licoricidin and licorisoflavan A possessed potential beneficial effects against oral microbial pathogens and the host immune response involved in common ora-dental diseases (dental caries, periodontitis, candidiasis and recurrent aphthous ulcers) (Messier et al. 2012). A 1989 split-mouth clinical study on 21 dental subjects found that glycyrrhizin had a tendency toward a statistically significant effect for controlling dental plaque formation caused by cariogenic bacteria after just a few days (Steinberg et al. 1989). However, another pilot study involving 40 male and female volunteers showed that tooth brushing for up to 42 days with a toothpaste containing glycyrrhizin had no effect on the plaque index compared with using a control toothpaste (Goultschin et al. 1991). Possible explanations for the lack of efficiency in improvement of plaque, gingival and bleeding indices may have been an insufficient glycyrrhizin concentration and/or chemical incompatibility in a toothpaste containing a mixture of an anionic detergent and an organic antibacterial surface agent. In a more recent pilot study of pre-school children, clinical reduction of Streptococcus mutans was obtained by using a licorice root lollipop intervention twice daily for 3 weeks (Peters et al. 2010). High-risk children showed the steepest early decrease in mean log-Streptococcus mutan. At the end of a follow-up (9 week) period, the log Streptococcus mutans decrease moved the high-risk group down to moderate-risk level. Glycyrrhizol A extracted from licorice roots was found to have strong antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria like Streptococcus mutans (Hu et al. 2011). In two pilot human studies they found that a brief application of sugar-free licorice lollipops (twice a day for 10 days) led to a marked reduction of cariogenic bacteria in oral cavity among most human subjects tested. This herbal lollipop could be a novel tool to promote oral health through functional foods. Jain et al. (2013) conducted as a double-blind pilot study of paediatric patients (N = 60), aged 7\u201314 years, equally divided by randomization into three groups, namely, Group 1 using aqueous liquorice mouthwash (15 %), Group 2 using ethanolic liquorice mouthwash (3.75 %) and Group 3 using chlorhexidine gluconate (0.156 %) as positive control. They found the mean Streptococcus mutans colony counts in all three groups decreased significantly immediately after the oral rinsing. The reduction in colony counts was significant in ethanolic liquorice group as compared to the control. Liquorice extracts also led to an immediate rise in salivary pH. The study affirmed that both aqueous and ethanolic liquorice extracts were potent cariostatic agents and were palatable by child patients.",

            "text": "Glycyrrhizin exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of the replication of hepatitis A virus (HAV) in PLC/PRF/5 cells (Crance et al. 1994). It was shown to inhibit an early stage of the HAV replication. In in-vitro studies, glycyrrhizin suppressed the secretion of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) dose-dependently in PLC/PRF/5 cells (Takahara et al. 1994). It was found that glycyrrhizin suppressed the intracellular transport of HBsAg at the trans-Golgi area after O-linked glycosylation and before its sialylation. Glycyrrhizin administered intravenously in guinea pigs might bind to hepatocytes at the concentration at which glycyrrhizin could modify the expression of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related antigens on the hepatocytes and suppress sialylation of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) (Sato et al. 1996). Glycyrrhizin and its diastereoisomers were found to be inhibitory against two new human herpes virus: HHV-6 and HHV-7 (Ceremelli et al. 1996). Randomized controlled trials confirmed that the Glycyrrhiza glabra derived compound glycyrrhizin and its derivatives reduced hepatocellular damage in chronic hepatitis B and C (Fiore et al. 2008). In hepatitis C virus-induced cirrhosis the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was reduced. Animal studies demonstrated a reduction of mortality and viral activity in herpes simplex virus encephalitis and influenza A virus pneumonia. In-vitro studies revealed antiviral activity against HIV-1, SARS related coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, arboviruses, vaccinia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus. Mechanisms for antiviral activity of Glycyrrhiza spp. include reduced transport to the membrane and sialylation of hepatitis B virus surface antigen, reduction of membrane fluidity leading to inhibition of fusion of the viral membrane of HIV-1 with the cell, induction of interferon gamma in T-cells, inhibition of phosphorylating enzymes in vesicular stomatitis virus infection and reduction of viral latency (Fiore et al. 2008). Matsumoto et al. (2013) demonstrated that glycyrrhizin treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected Huh7 cells caused a reduction of infectious HCV production. The results suggested that glycyrrhizin inhibited the release of infectious HCV particles via its inhibitory effect on 1B phospholipase A2. Also combination treatment with glycyrrhizin augmented IFN-induced reduction of virus in the cell culture-produced HCV system.",

(1987) found that glycyrrhizin completely inhibited human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-induced plaque formation in molt-4 (MT-4 ) cells at a concentration of 0.6 mM, the 50 % inhibitory dose being 0.15 mM. Glycyrrhizin completely inhibited the cytopathic effect of HIV and the HIV-specific antigen expression in MT-4 cells at a concentration of 0.3 and 0.6 mM, respectively. Further, glycyrrhizin inhibited giant cell formation of HIV-infected Molt-4 clone No. 8 cells. The anti-HIV-1 activity of glycyrrhizin may be attributed to its inhibition of protein kinase activity and partly to an interference with virus-cell binding (Ito et al. 1988). Five phenolics licochalcone A, isolicoflavonol, glycycoumarin, glycyrrhisoflavone and licopyranocoumarin isolated from licorice inhibited the cytopathic activity of a human immunodeficiency virus (Hatano et al. 1988). An anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) phenolic constituent, licopyranocoumarin was isolated from Si-pei licorice (a commercial licorice; root and stolon of Glycyrrhiza sp. from the north-western region of China) (Hatano et al. 1989). Betulinic acid and dihydrobetulinic acid derivatives were reported to be potent anti-HIV agents (Kashiwada et al. 1996). The results of in-vitro studies indicated that glycyrrhizin had the potential to inhibit a non-syncytium-inducing variant of HIV (NSI-HIV) replication in HIV-infected patients peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures by inducing the production of \u03b2-chemokines CCL4 and CCL5 (Sasaki et al. 2002\u20132003). 18\u03b1-glycyrrhizic acid exhibited anti-HIV activity based on primary infection of MT-4 lymphoid cells with HIV (an acute HIV infection model) using strain HIV/EVK but its esters 18\u03b1-glycyrrhizic acid pentasulphate sodium disodium salt (III), 18\u03b1-glycyrrhizic acid di-O-nicotinate (IV) exhibited lower activity (Baltina et al. 2010).

            "text": "Glycyrrhizic acid inactivated herpes simplex virus particles irreversibly (Pompei et al. 1979). Studies by Utsunomiya et al. (1995) found that glycyrrhizin improved the resistance of thermally injured mice to opportunistic infection of herpes simplex virus type 1 through the induction of CD4+ contrasuppressor T cells. Glycyrrhizin was found to reduce morbidity and mortality of mice infected with lethal doses of influenza virus through stimulation of IFN-gamma production by T cells (Utsunomiya et al. 1997). In-vitro studies showed that soyasaponin II was more potent than soyasaponin I against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) as shown by reduction of HSV-1 production (Hayashi et al. 1997). When acyclovir and soyasaponin II were evaluated in combination for anti-HSV-1 activity, additive antiviral effects were observed for this virus. Soyasaponin II was also found to inhibit the replication of human cytomegalovirus, influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. The action was not due to inhibition of virus penetration and protein synthesis, but might involve a virucidal effect. Ghannad et al. (2014) found that aqueous licorice extract pretreatment of Vero cells infected with HSV-1 was efficacious. There was significant difference in the efficacy of the extract with regard to incubation period between 1 and 4 h, 1 and 8 h, 4 and 12 h and 8 and 12 h. When glycyrrhizic acid and rapamycin were added to HeLa cells together with the viruses, glycyrrhizic acid demonstrated a strong anti-herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) activity, whereas rapamycin had no activity (Laconi et al. 2014). However, if the compounds were added to the cells 24 h before the viruses, glycyrrhizic acid induced the production of an even higher amount of Beclin 1 and showed an improved antiviral effect; under these conditions, rapamycin was also able to exert a significant anti-HSV1 activity. The results suggested glycyrrhizic acid to be a strong inducer of the autophagy activator Beclin 1.",

When human embryonic fibroblast (HEF) cells were treated with glycyrrhizin after inoculation of virus (post-treatment), the average 50 %-inhibitory dose (ID50) for five VZV strains was 0.71 mM, and the selectivity index (ratio of ID50 for host-cell DNA synthesis to ID50 for VZV replication) was 30. Glycyrrhizin was also effective against VZV replication when HEF cells were treated 24 h before the inoculation (pretreatment). In addition, at a concentration of 2.4 mM glycyrrhizin inactivated more than 99 % of virus particles within 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. In combination with other anti-herpes drugs (acyclovir, adenine arabinoside, bromovinyldeoxyuridine and phosphonoformate) or human native \u03b2-interferon, glycyrrhizin had an additive or slightly synergistic effect on VZV replication. Glycyrrhizin, licorice and ammonium salt of glycyrrhizic acid exhibited antiviral activity on three strains of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Nakayama, P-20778 and 821564XY48 (Badam 1997). Purified glycyrrhizin inhibited plaque formation in all three strains of JEV at a concentration of 500 \u03bcg/ml at 96 h. Similar effect was observed at 1000 \u03bcg/ml concentration with licorice and ammonium salt of glycyrrhizic acid. The minimal inhibitory concentrations were not toxic to porcine stable kidney (PS) and human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cell lines. Glycyrrhizin inhibited the viral antigen expression of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in human monocytic cell line U-937 and human embryonic lung cell line MRC-5 in-vitro (Numazaki et al. 1994). Glycyrrhizin (GA) and primary metabolite 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA) pharmacologically active components of the medicinal licorice root had both been shown to have antiviral and immunomodulatory properties (Hardy et al. 2012). However, GRA, but not GA, exhibited significant antiviral activity against rotavirus replication in-vitro. GRA treatment reduced rotavirus yields by 99 % when added to infected cultures post-virus adsorption. In in-vivo studies, they showed that GRA delivered orally to mice with rotavirus infection augmented lymphocyte recruitment to the intestinal mucosa and induced maturation of B cell-rich ILF independently of ectopic antigenic stimulus (Hendricks et al. 2012). GRA reduced the duration of viral antigen shedding, and endpoint serum antibody titers were higher in GRA-treated animals.",

Licorice exhibited hypocholesterolaemic action and improved the impaired function of both liver and kidney. Administration of Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract to male rats at oral doses of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg for 4 weeks induced a significant decrease in food intake and significant increases in body weight gain and feed efficiency ratio as compared to the control (Shalaby et al. 2004). At doses of 400 and 800 mg/kg, the extract caused significant decreases in total cholesterol and triglycerides associated with non-significant reductions in HDLc, LDLc and VLDLc concentrations in the serum. The extract at all doses produced significant decreases in the levels of serum liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and urea nitrogen, while the creatinine concentration significantly decreased by the high dose only. Studies showed that feeding obese diabetic KK-A(y) mice with diets containing licorice flavonoid oil (LFO) suppressed body weight gain, weights of abdominal adipose tissues and blood glucose levels (Nakagawa et al. 2004). Furthermore, LFO and licorice ethanolic extract stimulated human adipocyte differentiation in-vitro. The results indicated that licorice hydrophobic flavonoids possessed abdominal fat-lowering and hypoglycaemic effects, possibly mediated via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma).",

Furthermore, significant increases in faecal cholesterol, neutral sterols and bile acid excretion along with an increase in hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity and bile acid production were observed in these animals. The root powder administration to hypercholesterolaemic rats also decreased hepatic lipid peroxidation with a concomitant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities and total ascorbic acid content. The antioxidant status of these animals also was improved upon treatment. Animal studies showed that G. glabra extract significantly decreased total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides levels, increased HDL cholesterol and reduced atereosclerotic lesion in the aorta of hypercholesterolemic rabbits (Asgary et al. 2007). This effect was ascribed to the effect of licorice on plasma lipoproteins and its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.",

The ethanolic extract, ethyl acetate soluble, water soluble and hexane soluble fraction increased the serum HDL-cholesterol level by 14.8, 34.3, 27.3 and 17.2 %, respectively. The ethanolic extract, ethyl acetate fraction, aqueous fraction and hexane fraction decreased the triglyceride level by 31.3, 37.2, 41.2 and 28.9 %, respectively. The reduction in LDL-cholesterol level by ethanolic extract, ethyl acetate soluble fraction and water soluble fraction were 43.9, 31.0, 33.4 and 24.6 %, respectively. Compared with obese mice in the control group, those fed a high-fat diet containing1% and 2 % licorice flavonoid oil (LFO) presented reductions in the weight of abdominal white adipose tissues and body weight gain (Aoki et al. 2007a). A histological examination revealed that the adipocytes became smaller and the fatty degenerative state of the hepatocytes was improved in the 2 % LFO group. The findings suggested that LFO prevented and ameliorated diet-induced obesity via the regulation of lipid metabolism-related gene expression in the liver. Their findings suggested that the decrease in abdominal adipose tissue weight by LFO was mediated by the transcriptional regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) (a transcription factor promoting hepatic fatty acid synthesis), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) (a transcription factor promoting hepatic fatty acid oxidation) in the liver (Honda et al. 2009). Among the isolated phenolic compounds from G. glabra root ethanol extract, 5\u2032-formylglabridin; (2R,3R)-3,4\u2032,7-trihydroxy-3\u2032-prenylflavane; echinatin; (3R)-2\u2032,3\u2032,7-trihydroxy-4\u2032-methoxyisoflavan; kanzonol X; kanzonol W; shinpterocarpin; licoflavanone A; glabrol; shinflavanone; gancaonin L; and glabrone all exhibited significant PPAR-\u03b3 ligand-binding activity (Kuroda et al. 2010). The activity of these compounds at a sample concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL was three times more potent than that of 0.5 \u03bcM troglitazone. Among 12 flavonoids isolated from G. glabra roots, isoliquiritigenin; 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-tetrahydroxy-2-methoxychalcone; licuroside and isoliquiritoside showed strong inhibition against pancreatic lipase in-vitro with IC50 values of 7.3 \u03bcM, 35.5 \u03bcM, 14.9 \u03bcM and 37.6 \u03bcM, respectively (Birari et al. 2011). In high fat diet (HFD) fed rats supplemented with isoliquiritigenin, the body weight increase was only 23.2 g as compared to 64.2 g in the HFD control group while rats treated with licuroside showed 23.2 g weight gain only. Isoliquiritigenin decreased the levels of plasma total cholesterol (TC) to 84.6 mg/dl and plasma total triglycerides (TG) to 128.8 mg/dl. Licuroside also lowered the plasma TC and TG levels considerably. The results indicated the potential of the chalcone scaffold as a source of pancreatic lipase inhibitors for preventing obesity.",

It was suggested that licorice could reduce fat by inhibiting 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 1 at the level of fat cells. In another study of 18 healthy women (age range 20\u201333 years) with normal BMI, topical application of a cream containing 2.5 % glycyrrhetinic acid to the thigh for a month reduced the thickness of subcutaneous layer of thigh fat in comparison to the contralateral untreated thigh and to control subjects treated with the placebo cream (Armanini et al. 2005). The effect of glycyrrhetinic acid on the thickness of subcutaneous fat was likely related to a block of 11\u03b2a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 at the level of fat cells; therefore, glycyrrhetinic acid could be effectively used in the reduction of unwanted local fat accumulation.",

It was concluded that the hepatocyte microculture system presented was suitable for the screening of hepatoprotective substances. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) exhibited protective effects against aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-induced cytotoxicity in human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) (Chan et al. 2003). Both CYP1A1 and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities were increased in cells after treatment with the GA. For cells without GA pretreatment, cell injury was implicated as indicated by the decrease in cell viability. It was found that GA pretreatment provided protective effects in terms of the enzyme activity and increase in cell viability. GA also protected against aflatoxin-induced oxidative stress. In a hepatocyte model of cholestatic liver injury in a hepatocyte model of cholestatic liver injury, pre-incubation with licorice glycyrrhizin exerted pro-apoptotic properties, whereas pre-incubation with its metabolite 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid potently inhibited bile acid-induced apoptosis and necrosis in a manner consistent with its antioxidative effect (Gumpricht et al. 2005). Pretreatment with glycyrrhizic acid (GA) (4 \u03bcg) protected the hepatocytes against t-BHP induced oxidative injury and the results were comparable to the pretreatment with positive control, that is, silymarin (Tripathi et al. 2009). The protective potential against cell death was achieved mainly by preventing intracellular GSH depletion, decrease in ROS formation as well as inhibition of mitochondrial membrane depolarization. GA was found to modulate critical end points of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and could be beneficial against liver diseases.",

Biotransformation of 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid by Absidia pseudocylinderospora, Gliocladium viride and Cunninghamella echinulata afforded seven metabolites, including three new ones 15\u03b1-hydroxy-18\u03b1-glycyrrhetinic acid; 13\u03b2-hydroxy-7\u03b1,27-oxy-12-dihydro-18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid and 1\u03b1-hydroxy-18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid and known metabolites 7\u03b2, 15\u03b1-dihydroxy-18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid; 7\u03b2-hydroxy-18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid; 5\u03b1-hydroxy-18 \u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid and 3-oxo derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid (Maatooq et al. 2010).

Administration of 18\u03b2-GA also significantly restored the expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclooxygenase 2, inducible nitric oxide synthase and nuclear factor \u03baB. Furthermore, histological observations also supported the preventive effects of 18\u03b2-GA. Their findings suggested that pretreatment with 18\u03b2-GA showed potential hepatoprotective effects via attenuation of oxidative stress, inflammation and hyperproliferation.",

Intragastric administration of liquiritigenin (20 mg/kg) for 15 days effectively inhibited the growth of transplanted H(22) hepatocarcinoma in mice (Zhou et al. 2010). It also decreased malondialdehyde content and increased thymus weight. The study by Kim et al. (2010) demonstrated that isoliquiritin, a licorice antioxidant flavonoid, had the ability to repress liver X receptor-\u03b1 (LXR\u03b1)-dependent hepatic steatosis through JNK1 inhibition and protected hepatocytes from oxidative injury inflicted by fat accumulation. In mice fed a high-fat diet, isoliquiritin treatment inhibited hepatic steatosis, as shown by a decrease in fat accumulation and repression of lipogenic genes. The results of blood biochemistry and histopathology confirmed attenuation of high-fat diet-induced liver injury by isoliquiritin. Moreover, isoliquiritin inhibited oxidative stress, as indicated by decreases in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance formation, iNOS and COX2 induction, and nitrotyrosinylation.",

            "text": "Studies showed that compared to glycyrrhizin (Gly) and matrine (Mat) alone, a combination of Gly + Mat reduced the mortality of acetaminophen overdosed mice more effectively, attenuated acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, and reduced the number and area of \u03b3-GT positive foci, thus protecting liver function and preventing hepatocellular carcinoma from occurring (Wan et al. 2009). Further, Gly + Mat had a protective effect on immunosuppression, a strong non-specific anti-inflammatory effect, and an effect of reducing the incidence of sodium and water retention. Glycyrrhizin (Gly) in combination with matrine (Mat) had a better effect in inhibiting the proliferation of activated rat hepatic stellate cell (HSC) line and diminishing collagen I and HA levels secreted by HSC as compared with Gly or Mat alone (Zhao et al. 2012a). The combination significantly reduced serum hexadecenoic acid and laminin and procollgan type-III levels in the rat model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis compared with Gly or Mat alone. Hepatic histological analysis also confirmed that Gly + Mat administration exhibited the recovery effect remarkably and could improve liver fibrosis in-vitro and in-vivo more effectively. El-Tahawy et al. (2011) found that pretreatment with glycyrrhizin protected against lipopolysaccharide/d-galactosamine-induced acute hepatitis in albino rats by its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. Studies by Tu et al. (2012) found that mice treated with glycyrrhizin prevented concanavalin A-induced liver inflammation and fibrosis. Glycyrrhizin was found to alleviate liver injury and fibrosis progression via regulation of CD4+T cell response in JNK, ERK and PI3K/AKT-dependent pathways. Results of studies by Tsai et al. (2013) suggested that glycyrrhizin pre-treatment decreased total parenteral nutrition-associated acute liver injury factors in rats by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress and reactive nitrogen stress. Results of animal studies by Kuroda et al. (2014) revealed that a single injection of LPS/GalN (lipopolysaccharide/d-galactosamine) might stimulate apoptosis of mouse hepatocytes through the binding of HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) protein to Gsto1(Glutathione S-transferase omega-1) promoter region and that glycyrrhizin-treatment might prevent the apoptosis and inflammatory infiltrates caused by LPS/GalN-injection in mouse liver by disturbing the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter sequence. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 200 mg/kg glycyrrhizin from licorice significantly protected lithocholic acid (LCA)-induced liver damage in mice, indicated by alleviated histology alteration and prevention of the alanine transaminase elevation (Han et al. 2014). Glycyrrhizin treatment significantly prevented LCA-induced reduction of the three phospholipid compounds, lysophosphatidylcholine LPC 16:0, LPC 18:0 and LPC 18:2. Glycyrrhizin and omega-3 fatty acids (\u03c9-3) alone or in combination protected rat liver from thioacetamide-induced hepatotoxic effects as they significantly decreased serum aspartate aminotransferase activity and serum total bilirubin level; they also significantly increased serum albumin and total protein levels (El Magd et al. 2015). The hepatoprotective effects of glycyrrhizin and \u03c9-3 were confirmed by the histopathological analysis as they significantly reduced the necroinflammatory scores and the extent of fibrosis. GL and \u03c9-3 significantly decreased liver malondialdehyde level.",

            "text": "In a clinical trial of 18 patients with subacute hepatic failure due to viral hepatitis, thrice weekly intravenously treatment of the interferon stimulator named Stronger Neo Minophagen-C (SNMC) derived from the plant G. glabra for 8 weeks increased survival rate (Acharya et al. 1993). The survival rate among these patients was 72.2 %, as compared to the earlier reported rate of 31.1 % in 98 patients who received supportive therapy. In a retrospective study, long-term administration of the Japanese medicine \u2018Stronger Neo-Minophagen C\u2019 (SNMC), which contained 0.2 % glycyrrhizin (GL), 0.1 % cysteine and 2.0 % glycine in physiologic saline solution, used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, was effective in preventing liver carcinogenesis (Arase et al. 1997). The 10th-year rates of cumulative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence for Group A (SNMC-treated) and Group B (vitamin K-treated) were 7 % and 12 %, respectively, and the 15th-year rates were 12 % and 25 %. HCC is caused by hepatitis C virus. By Cox regression analysis, the relative risk of HCC incidence in patients not treated with SNMC (Group B) was 2.49 compared with that of patients treated with SNMC (Group A). SNMC was also reported to be particularly helpful in patients who failed to respond to interferon and in patients who could not be treated with it for various reasons (Kumada 2002). In a prospective randomized controlled trial of 170 patients glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhizin plus ursodeoxycholic acid were compared for efficacy against chronic hepatitis C virus infection (Tsubota et al. 1999). It was found that the combined therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid and glycyrrhizin was safe and effective in improving liver-specific enzyme abnormalities and may be an alternative to interferon in chronic hepatitis C virus infection, especially for interferon-resistant or unstable patients. In a double\u2010blind, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled phase I/II trial of 57 patients with chronic hepatitis C, intravenous glycyrrhizin administration at a dose of 240 mg, thrice weekly for 4 weeks, lowered serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during treatment, but had no effect on hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA levels (van Rossum et al. 1999). The drug appeared to be safe and is well tolerated. The mechanism by which glycyrrhizin improved liver biochemistry and histology are not well elucidated (van Rossum and De Man 1998). In another clinical study of 69 European patients with chronic hepatitis C, glycyrrhizin treatment induced a significant decrease in ALT. Six times per week glycyrrhizin treatment for 4 weeks appeared more effective than three times per week. In another randomized phase II trial, HCV-RNA-positive patients with elevated ALT and marked fibrosis or necro-inflammation who were not eligible for interferon therapy were treated for 4 weeks with six infusions weekly of glycyrrhizin (Orlent et al. 2006). Seventy two patients with an ALT response at week 4 were randomized to continue treatment for 22 weeks in three dose frequency groups: 6\u00d7, 3\u00d7 or once weekly. They found that ALT responses induced by 4 weeks glycyrrhizin therapy could be maintained in a subset of chronic hepatitis C patients receiving at least three injections weekly. The observed ALT response did not translate in a significant histological improvement after 6 months treatment.",

Moreover, glycyrrhizic acid and 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid may modulate the ratio of the mitochondrial Bcl-2 family and influence PI3K/Akt signalling. Glycyrrhizin and its metabolite 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid in Glycyrrhiza, a constituent herb of yokukansan, a traditional Japanese medicine, ameliorated thiamine deficiency-induced dysfunction of glutamate transport in cultured rat cortical astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner (Kawakami et al. 2010). Studies indicated that extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and mitochondria-related pathways were essential for the neuroprotective effect of glycyrrhizic acid against glutamate-induced toxicity in DPC12 cells (Wang et al. 2014a). Glycyrrhizic acid pretreatment enhanced activation of ERKs but not AKT (protein kinase B). This was further confirmed by Teng et al. (2014a) who demonstrated the involvement of the ERK pathway in the neuroprotective effects of glycyrrhizic acid against the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced apoptosis of dopaminergic neuronal cells. Pretreatment with glycyrrhizic acid had no effects on the expression of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and total AKT (t-AKT).",

It was found that non-polar compounds containing glycyrrhizin-degraded products, such as glycyrrhetinic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid monoglucuronide, were increased in roasted licorice. In an in-vitro study, both raw and roasted licorice significantly reduced acetate dehydrogenase release from PC12 cells exposed to hypoxia. G. glabra root extract (250 and 500 mg/kg) promoted the locomotor activity and spatial behaviour significantly, which was impaired in hypoxic rats (Muralidharan et al. 2009). The extract administration restored the decreased levels of brain enzymes such as glutamate and dopamine and decreased acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity significantly. Levels of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and catalase were reduced due to hypoxia and were restored to near normalcy by administration of G. glabra extract. Oral administration of aqueous licorice root extract in the dose of 150 and 225 mg/kg to 1-month-old male Wistar albino rats showed a significant enhancement of dendritic arborization (dendritic branching points) and dendritic intersections along the length of both apical and basal dendrites in hippocampal (CA3) pyramidal neurons (Chakravarthi and Avadhani 2014). The results indicated that constituents present in aqueous licorice root extract had neuronal dendritic growth stimulating properties.",

            "text": "In-vivo studies by Zhang et al. (2014a) showed that glycyrrhizin had neuroprotective efficacy against brain ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury in mice through high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling pathway. Administration of glycyrrhizin (10 mg/kg) intravenously in rats at 3 or 6 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion reduced infarct volumes to 12.9 % and 46.2 %, respectively (Kim et al. 2012). This neuroprotective effect was accompanied by improvements in motor impairment and neurological deficits and suppressions of microglia activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine induction. The results indicated that glycyrrhizin had neuroprotective efficacy in the post-ischemic brain via its anti-inflammatory, anti-excitotoxic and anti-oxidative effects and in particular, it exerted anti-inflammatory effect, at least in part, by inhibiting HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) secretion. Song et al. (2013) found that oral administration of glycyrrhizin alleviated neuro-inflammation and memory deficit induced by systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in mice. Glycyrrhizin significantly reduced TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA, COX-2 and iNOS protein expressions and the elevated Iba1 protein expression and the average cell size of Iba1-expressing microglia induced by LPS. In the Morris water maze test, glycyrrhizin significantly prolonged the swimming time spent in the target and peri-target zones. Glycyrrhizin also significantly increased the target heading and memory score numbers. The neuroprotective effect of glycyrrhizin was found to be mediated through the inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators and microglial activation in the brain tissue. Glycyrrhizin exhibited neuroprotective effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat brains through the inhibition of inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptotic injury by antagonizing the cytokine activity of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) (Gong et al. 2014). Pretreatment with glycyrrhizin significantly reduced infarct volume and improved the accompanying neurological deficits in locomotor function. The expression levels of inflammation- and oxidative stress-related molecules including TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, which were over-expressed in I/R, were decreased by glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizin was found to reduce secondary brain injury and improved outcomes in rat following traumatic brain injury (TBI) by downregulation of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)/HMGB1 receptors (toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE))/NF-\u03baB-mediated inflammatory responses in the injured rat brain (Gu et al. 2014). Beam walking performance impairment and brain oedema were significantly reduced in TBI + glycyrrhizin group compared with TBI group. In separate studies, Okuma et al. (2014) found glycyrrhizin to be a novel for TBI through its interference with HMGB1 and RAGE interaction in rats. The beneficial effects of glycyrrhizin on motor and cognitive functions persisted for 7 days after injury.",

            "text": "In in-vivo studies in dogs, G. glabra extract was found to have anti-cholinergic action as it blocked the stimulatory effect of acetylcholine; the extract produced inhibition of the intestinal movements (Shihata and Elghamry 1963b). Studies with licorice-derived enzyme inhibitors indicated functional effects for 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD) in the adult brain, notably in the periventricular hypothalamus and limbic system (Seckl 1997). 11\u03b2-HSD catalyses the conversion of the active glucocorticoids corticosterone and cortisol to inert 11 keto-products (11-dehydrocorticosterone, cortisone), thus regulating access of glucocorticoids to receptors. Thus, 11beta-HSD represents a novel and potentially important level of control of glucocorticoid action in the CNS. Enzyme modulation by pharmacological or other agents may provide a useful means to target increased or attenuated glucocorticoid action to specific sites in the brain. Administration of Glycyrrhiza glabra aqueous extract (150 mg/kg) significantly improved learning and memory of mice in the elevated plus-maze and passive avoidance test (Dhingra et al. 2004). Furthermore, this dose significantly reversed the amnesia induced by diazepam (1 mg/kg i.p.) and scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg i.p.). Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of liquorice may be contributing favourably to the memory enhancement effect (Parle et al. 2004). As scopolamine-induced amnesia was reversed by liquorice, it was suggested that the beneficial effect on learning and memory may be because of facilitation of cholinergic transmission in brain. The results showed G. glabra to have promise as a memory enhancer in both exteroceptive and interoceptive behavioural models of memory. Administration of 150 mg/kg aqueous licorice extract significantly reduced the immobility times of mice in both forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), without any significant effect on locomotor activity of mice (Dhingra and Sharma 2006). The efficacy of extract was found to be comparable to that of imipramine (15 mg/kg i.p.) and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg i.p.). Liquorice extract reversed reserpine-induced extension of immobility period of mice in FST and TST. It was found that the antidepressant-like effect of liquorice extract appeared to be mediated by increase of brain norepinephrine and dopamine, but not by increase of serotonin (Cui et al. 2008). Oral administration of the higher doses (2 and 4 mg/kg) of glabridin and piracetam to mice significantly antagonized the amnesia induced by scopolamine in both the elevated plus maze test and passive avoidance test. Furthermore, glabridin (2 and 4 mg/kg per os) and metrifonate (50 mg/kg intra-perperitoneally), used as a standard drug, both remarkably reduced the brain cholinesterase activity in mice compared to the control group. The results suggested glabridin to be a promising candidate for memory improvement.",

In APP-PS1 double transgenic mice, treatment with 9 mg/kg/day of TDC markedly decreased A\u03b2 production and A\u03b2 plaque formation, while efficiently improving the memory impairment based on Morris water maze test. Their findings demonstrated that the natural product TDC as a new BACE1 inhibitor could ameliorate memory impairment in mice and could have potential as a lead compound for further anti-Alzheimer\u2019s disease reagent development. Studies showed that liquiritigenin treatment improved the behavioural performance of Abeta (25\u201335) hippocampal-injected rats and attenuated neuronal loss in the brain (Liu et al. 2010a). More importantly, liquiritigenin treatment decreased mRNA levels and protein expression of Notch-2, an effect that could promote the generation of new neurons. They found that treatment of brain-derived progenitor cell cultures with liquiritigenin increased the number of cells that differentiated into neurons; but the treatment did not alter the growth of astrocytes (Liu et al. 2010b). In addition, treatment with liquiritigenin decreased Notch-2 mRNA and protein expression, which could promote the growth of new neurons. In a subsequent study, they found that treatment with liquiritigenin improved the behavioural performance of transgenic mice and it attenuated the protein expression of oligomeric form of amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) (Liu et al. 2011). Furthermore, treatment with liquiritigenin inhibited astrocytosis in the hippocampus, through its inhibitory activities on Notch-2, an important molecular regulating neural proliferation and differentiation. These findings provided evidence for beneficial activity of liquiritigenin in a mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

The major flavonoid glabrol was isolated from the flavonoid-rich fraction of GGE; it inhibited [3H] flumazenil binding to the GABAA-BZD receptors in rat cerebral cortex membrane. Glabrol increased sleep duration and decreased sleep latency in a dose-dependent manner (5, 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg); its hypnotic effect was also blocked by flumazenil a well-known \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A-benzodiazepine (GABAA-BZD) receptor antagonist. The results implied that GGE and its flavonoid glabrol induced sleep via a positive allosteric modulation of GABAA-BZD receptors. Results of animal studies demonstrated that the anti-amnestic dose of Glycyrrhiza glabra extract (150 mg/kg for 7 days) resulted in prepulse inhibition (PPI) disruption; it augmented cortical, hippocampal and striatal monoamine levels in mice (Michel et al. 2013). It was concluded that liquorice extract (150 mg/kg)-induced PPI deficit was mediated through augmenting monoaminergic transmission in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum.",

Liquiritigenin and 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid potently inhibited the passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction as well as the scratching behaviour in mice induced by compound 48/80. These components inhibited the production of IgE in ovalbumin-induced asthma mice but liquiritigenin had little effect. The results suggested that the anti-allergic effects of licorice were mainly due to glycyrrhizin, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid and liquiritigenin, which could relieve IgE-induced allergic diseases such as dermatitis and asthma. At non-toxic \u226510 \u03bcM concentration, isoliquiritigenin blocked the induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin on activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and markedly interfered with THP-1 monocyte adhesion to TNF-alpha-activated endothelial cells (Kwon et al. 2007). Isoliquiritigenin abolished TNF-alpha-induced mRNA accumulation of VCAM-1 and E-selectin. Additionally, isoliquiritigenin attenuated platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) expression induced by TNF-alpha. In contrast, other components found in licorice, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, glycyrrhizin, formononetin and ononin did not downregulate the expression of VCAM-1 and/or PECAM-1 activated by TNF-alpha, implying that these components are inactive in modulating adhesion of leukocytes to stimulated endothelial cells. Isoliquiritigenin downregulated CAM proteins in TNF-alpha-activated HUVEC at the transcriptional levels by blocking degradation of IkappaBalpha and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. The results demonstrated that the induction blockade of VCAM-1 and E-selectin by isoliquiritigenin was directly mediated by its interference with the cell adhesion molecules (CAM) mRNA transcription through NF-kappaB-dependent mechanisms under inflammatory conditions. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages, isoliquiritigenin (ILG), more potently inhibited LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production than isoliquiritin (ILT) (Kim et al. 2008a). ILG dose-dependently reduced the LPS-induced expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) at the protein and mRNA levels via suppression of the transcription activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). The results suggested that the anti-inflammatory properties of ILG are caused by iNOS, COX-2, TNF-alpha and IL-6 downregulation due to NF-kappaB inhibition via the suppression of IKK, ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation in RAW 264.7 cells. Isoliquiritigenin and glycyrrhizin inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-\u03baB activation and interleukin IL-6 production in dose-dependent manners in RAW264.7 cells (Honda et al. 2012). They both modulated LPS sensor toll-like receptor 4/MD-2 complex at the receptor level, leading to suppress LPS-induced activation of signalling cascades and cytokine production, but their effects were exerted at different steps of TLR4/MD-2 signalling.",

These activities were postulated to be attributed to phenolic antioxidants involving isoflavan derivatives, coumarins and chalcones. Nonetheless, triterpene saponin glycyrrhizin exhibited no efficacy in the system of DPPH reaction and peroxidation of liposomal membrane, and negligible inhibition of chemiluminescence generated by inflammatory cells. These results indicate that the mechanism of anti-inflammatory effect of glycyrrhizin most probably did not involve ROS and this major constituent was not responsible for the inhibition effects of liquorice extract on neutrophil functions. The results of studies in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage model indicated that licorice glycyrrhizic acid and 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid may provide an anti-inflammatory effect by attenuating the generation of excessive NO, PGE(2) and ROS and by suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes through the inhibition of NF-\u03baB and PI3K activity (Wang et al. 2011). Kao et al. (2010) demonstrated that both glycyrrhizic acid (GA) and 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (18\u03b2GA) reduced inflammatory cytokine production and its resulting anti-inflammation (Kao et al. 2010). GA acted via PI3K/Akt/GSK3\u03b2 to reduce cytokine production, while 18\u03b2GA caused the dissociation of a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-HSP90 complex to block inflammation. They proposed that GA and 18\u03b2GA may be valuable biological inhibitors of lung inflammation. In-vitro studies using murine macrophages (J774A.1) and human neutrophil (HL-60) cells revealed that G. glabra and glabridin significantly inhibited prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane (TXB2), cyclooxygenase (COX), leukotriene (LTB4), leukotriene (LTB4) and lipoxygenase (LOX), while isoliquiritigenin exerted inhibitory effect only against COX products but failed to suppress LOX products (Chandrasekaran et al. 2011a). However, glycyrrhizin at the tested concentrations failed to exhibit inhibitory effect on both COX and LOX products. Umbelliferone isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra rhizome exhibited 95.68 % inhibition of COX-2 at 10 \u03bcM concentration with IC50 < 1 \u03bcM (Kaur et al. 2012a). In the xylene-induced ear oedema and ovalbumin-induced mouse paw oedema assay, extracts of the cell culture of Glycyrrhiza exhibited similar anti-inflammatory effects to those of its field cultivated equivalent, through the enhancement of the SOD activity of plasma and liver tissues (Man et al. 2013).",

(2011) showed that the inhibitory effect of G. glabra extract on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory mediators was influenced by glabridin and isoliquiritigenin and was not contributed by glycyrrhizin. G. glabra and isoliquiritigenin significantly inhibited LPS stimulated NO, IL-1 \u03b2 and IL-6 production. Glabridin showed significant inhibition of NO and interleukin IL-1 \u03b2 release, but failed to attenuate IL-6 levels at the tested concentrations. In addition, glycyrrhizin did not exhibit inhibitory response towards any of the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory mediators at the tested concentrations. Treatment of THP-1 (human myelomonocytic leukaemia) cells with licochalcone C attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-IFN-\u03b3-induced inflammatory response by significantly decreasing the expression and activity of inducible nitrate synthase (iNOS) via NF\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa-B), by influencing extracellular O2\n\u2212 production, and by modulating the antioxidant network activity of SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase) and GPx (glutathione peroxidase) activity. It was hypothesized that licochalcone C had antioxidant properties since it reduced the production of superoxide radicals and consequently reduced the activity of iNOS (Franceschelli et al. 2011). Licorice extract inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264 murine macrophage cells (Uto et al. 2012). However, treatment of glycyrrhizin alone could not show the suppression of NO production and iNOS expression. The combined treatment with glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhizin-removed extract (GC\u2013KO) extract enhanced the attenuated inhibition. The ethyl acetate leaf extract showed good dose-dependent ability to inhibit release of both thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in whole blood (Siracusa et al. 2011). The methanol leaf extract appeared to inhibit only the PGE2 release, suggesting a selective action on the cyclooxy genase COX-2 pathway. No effect on TxB2 and PGE2 was observed with n-hexane leaf extract.",

Effect at doses tested was comparable to that of hydrocortisone and butazolidin. The Streptococcus LJ-22-transformed product, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid-3-O-\u03b2-d-glucuronide (GAMG), of glycyrrhizin (18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid-3-O-\u03b2-d-glucuronopyranosyl-(1 \u2192 2)-\u03b2-d-glucuronide, GL) exhibited anti-allergic activity with IC50 values of 0.28 mM (Park et al. 2004). GAMG, which was sweeter than glycyrrhizin, and 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, a GAMG metabolite by human intestinal bacteria, also inhibited the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and skin contact inflammation. Licorice root extract lipids produced statistically significant suppression of inflammatory oedema growth induced by 1 % carrageenan and 3 % formalin solutions in mice compared to that in the untreated control (Denisova et al. 2007) and their antiphlogistic action was comparable with that of the reference drug ortophen. In animal studies, glyderinine, a derivative of glycyrrhizic acid isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra, was found to exert a pronounced anti-inflammatory effect exceeding that of hydrocortisone and amidopyrine (Azimov et al. 1988). Oral administration of Glycyrrhiza glabra root extract to rats caused a significant reduction in pedal inflammation and swelling induced by formalin compared to the control group (Shalaby et al. 2004). However, the anti-inflammatory effect was less marked than that produced by tenoxicam (a standard anti-inflammatory drug). Glycyrrhizin, a major constituent of G. glabra (5 mg/kg) markedly inhibited ovalbumin (OVA)-induced immediate airway constriction, airway hyper-reactivity to methacholine, lung inflammation and infiltration of eosinophils in the peribronchial and perivascular areas in BALB/c mice (Ram et al. 2006). It prevented the reduction of interferon IFN-\u03b3 and decreased interleukin IL-4, IL-5 and eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Also, it reduced OVA-specific IgE levels and prevented the reduction of total IgG2a in serum. Studies by Ma et al. (2013) demonstrated that glycyrrhizic acid exerted anti-asthmatic effects via modulation of Th1/Th2 cytokines and enhancement of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice. Glycyrrhizic acid inhibited OVA-induced increases in Raw and eosinophil count; interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13 levels were recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; and increased IFN-\u03b3 level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Separate studies demonstrated that liquiritigenin exerted anti-inflammatory effects, through inhibition of NF-kappaB activation in Raw264.7 macrophages, thereby decreasing production of iNOS and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Kim et al. 2008b). In rats, liquiritigenin treatment inhibited the formation of paw oedema induced by carrageenan. Administration of glycyrrhizin at 10 mg/kg i.p. 5 min prior to carrageenan exerted potent anti-inflammatory effects in mice (Menegazzi et al. 2008). Injection of carrageenan into the pleural cavity of mice elicited an acute inflammatory response and carrageenan-induced pleurisy which were attenuated by glycyrrhizin. It was found that prevention of the activation of NF-\u03baB and STAT-3 by glycyrrhizin reduced the development of acute inflammation. 18\u03b2-Glycyrrhetinic acid ameliorated acute Propionibacterium acnes-induced liver injury in C57BL/6 mice through reduced macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1 expression in Kupffer cells by downregulating MyD88 expression and inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation (Xiao et al. 2010).",

            "text": "In-vitro studies showed that glycyrrhizin inhibited saponin-induced haemolysis in washed erythrocytes (Segal et al. 1977). The saponins inhibited included digitonin, tomatin, saponin A and cscin. Licorice extract and its major polyphenol glabridin protected low-density lipoprotein (LDL) against lipid peroxidation: in-vitro and in ex-vivo dietary supplementation studies in humans and in atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (Fuhrman et al. 1997). These results could be related to the absorption and binding of glabridin to the LDL particle and subsequent protection of the LDL from oxidation by multiple modes as shown in humans and in E zero mice. They also found that glabridin or quercetin consumption by atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice resulted in a 53 and 54 % reduction in copper ion induced oxidation, respectively, and a 95 and 83 % reduction in 2,2\u2032-azobis\u20322-amidino propane hydrochloride (AAPH) induced LDL oxidation, respectively (Belinky et al. 1998a). In the in-vitro oxidation of LDL induced by AAPH (5 mM), glabridin inhibited the formation of TBARS, lipid peroxides and cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxide (CLOOH) at all the concentrations tested (5\u201360 \u03bcM), while in oxidation induced by copper ions (10 \u03bcM), glabridin exhibited a pro-oxidant activity at concentrations lower than 20 \u03bcM, and a clear antioxidant activity at concentrations greater than 20 \u03bcM. Glabridin (30 \u03bcM) inhibited the formation of cholest-5-ene-3,7-diol (7-hydroxycholesterol), cholest-5-ene-3-ol-7-one (7-ketocholesterol) and cholestan-5,6-epoxy-3-ol (5,6-epoxycholesterol) after 6 h of AAPH-induced LDL oxidation, by 55, 80 and 40 %, respectively, and after 6 h of copper ion induced LDL oxidation, by 73, 94 and 52 %, respectively. Glabridin also inhibited the consumption of \u03b2-carotene and lycopene by 38 and 52 %, respectively, after 0.5 h of LDL oxidation with AAPH, but failed to protect vitamin E. The in-vivo and in-vitro reduction of the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation obtained with glabridin may be related to the absorption or binding of glabridin to the LDL particle and subsequent protection of LDL from oxidation by inhibiting the formation of lipid peroxides and oxysterols, and by protecting LDL associated carotenoids. Results of further studies suggested that the antioxidant effect of glabridin on LDL oxidation appeared to reside mainly in the 2\u2032 hydroxyl, and that the hydrophobic moiety of the isoflavan was essential to obtain this effect. It was also shown that the position of the hydroxyl group at B ring significantly affected the inhibitory efficiency of the isoflavan derivatives on LDL oxidation, but did not influence their ability to donate an electron to DPPH or their peak potential values (Belinky et al. 1998b). Both mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) and the J-774 A.1 macrophage-like cells accumulated up to 1.5 \u03bcg of glabridin/mg of cell protein after 2 h (Rosenblat et al. 1999). In parallel, in glabridin-enriched cells, macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL was inhibited by up to 80 % in comparison with control cells. In glabridin-enriched macrophages, protein kinase C activity was reduced by approximately 70 % and in in-vivo studies, using the atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E-deficient (E0) mice, glabridin reduced capability to oxidize LDL by 80 % in comparison with placebo-treated mice. This latter phenomenon was associated with a reduction in the lesion oxysterols and a 50 % reduction in the aortic lesion size. It was concluded that glabridin accumulation in macrophages was associated with reduced cell-mediated oxidation of LDL and decreased activation of the NADPH oxidase system and these phenomena could be responsible for the attenuation of atherosclerosis in E0 mice, induced by glabridin.",

Glycyrrhizin significantly decreased the levels of serum HMGB1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Glycyrrhizin changed the distribution of Bax and cytochrome c expression between the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions in the heart tissue, resulting in inhibition of myocardial apoptosis. Studies showed that Glycyrrhiza glabra protected rats from myocardial ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury by improving hemodynamic, biochemical, histopathological and ventricular function (Ojha et al. 2013). Pretreatment with G. glabra significantly prevented the depletion of the antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and myocyte injury marker enzymes: creatine phosphokinase-MB isoenzyme and lactate dehydrogenase. It also prevented depletion of glutathione (GSH) and inhibited lipid peroxidation in the heart. In addition to improving biochemical indices of myocardial function, G. glabra also significantly reinstated mean arterial pressure, heart rate, (\u00b1)LVdP/dtmax and attenuated abrupt rise in left ventricular end diastolic pressure. Histopathological preservation evidenced by reduced infiltration of cells and myonecrosis depicted the myocardial salvaging effect of G. glabra. Basso et al.

These flavonoids also showed anti-H. pylori activity against a clarithromycin (CLAR) and amoxicillin (AMOX)-resistant strains. Glycyrrhetinic acid was as the most potent compound (MIC50 = 50 mg/L, MIC90 = 100 mg/L) inhibiting 79.3 % Helicobacter pylori strains at 50 mg/L or <. Krausse et al. (2004) exhibited rapid, concentration and strain-dependent bactericidal activity. Clarithromycin-resistant strains of H. pylori were susceptible at 12.5 and 25 mg/L, and metronidazole-resistant strains at 25\u201350 and at 200 mg/L. The MIC distribution (mg/L) of the lipophilic acetylated derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid monoglucuronide was \u22646.25 (29.2 %), 50 (4.2 %), 100\u2013200 (12.5 %) and \u2265400 (54.1 %). Extractum liquiritiae and glycyrrhizic acid were less active (MICs >400 mg/L). Studies by Malek Jafarian and Ghazvini (2007) showed that therapeutically administered concentrations of licorice extract (100\u2013400 mg/ml) could have growth-inhibiting effect on H. pylori in-vitro. Cheel et al. (2013) found that the chemical profile of licorice quantitatively varied at different harvest times and these fluctuations determined changes in its bioactivities including gastroprotective activity. Licorice samples in May gave the best gastroprotective effect. Liquiritin and glycyrrhizin, the major constituents in the February and May licorice extract, appeared to contribute to the superoxide radical scavenging and gastroprotective effects. GutGard\u00ae, a flavonoid rich extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra, exhibited anti-Helicobacter pylori activity in both agar dilution and microbroth dilution methods possibly by inhibiting protein synthesis, DNA gyrase and dihydrofolate reductase (Asha et al. 2013). Glabridin, the major flavonoid present in GutGard\u00ae exhibited superior activity against Helicobacter pylori while glycyrrhizin did not show activity even at 250 \u03bcg/ml concentration.",

Studies demonstrated that deglycyrrhinized liquorice (DGL) exerted a protective effect against aspirin and aspirin plus bile acid-induced gastric mucosal damage, and aspirin absorption in rats (Russell et al. 1984). In the first study, lesion scores were increased from 6(3;10) with aspirin alone to 12(5;16) by taurodeoxycholic acid (TDC) and reduced by DGL to 1(0;3.5) for aspirin alone and 3.5(0;6) for aspirin plus TDC. In the second study a slight reduction of aspirin absorption was found only at 20 min with a median level of 0.9 mmol/l for the DGL treated rats and 1.2 mmol/l for the aspirin alone group. Although DGL diminished aspirin (128 mg/kg)-induced gastric mucosal damage from 17(12;25) to 8(3;14) when the two were given together it did not do so significantly when DGL was given before aspirin -15(20;22). Intraperitoneal deglycyrrhinized licorice reduced lesion scores from aspirin (128 mg/kg) from 14(11;24) to 7(1;19), thus indicating a systemic as well as a local effect of deglycyrrhinized licorice. Bennett et al. (1985) concluded that in rats, carbenoxolone and deglycyrrhized liquorice may exert their anti-ulcer effect by a non-prostaglandin mechanism. This contrasted with the mechanism occurring in man with carbenoxolone. Aspirin coated with liquorice was found to reduce the number and size of gastric ulcers, reducing the ulcer index from 1.5 to 0.5 and the incidence from 96 to 46 % in rats (Dehpour et al. 1994). Coating with derivatives including the deglycyrrhized form, a high glycyrrhized form, carbenoxolone and enoxolone was less effective (ulcer index, 0.70\u20130.94; incidence 62\u201376 %). GutGard dose dependently decreased gastric content, total acidity, ulcer index and increased the pH of gastric fluid in pylorus ligated ulcer rats (Mukherjee et al. 2010). In cold-restraint stress and indomethacin induced ulcer rats all the doses of GutGard decreased the ulcer index and increased the pH of gastric fluid. GutGard exhibited potent antioxidant activity with high hydrophilic and lipophilic oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) value.",

In another clinical trial of 96 patients with gastric ulcer, after 4 weeks no differences were found between placebo or treatment with deglycyrrhizinated liquorice whether assessed by gastroscopy or radiology, or in the percentage reduction in ulcer area, or in clinical improvement (Bardhan et al. 1978).

This effect was related to the polysaccharides isolated from the extract, with one purified acidic fraction (0.25 SPB) as main active polymer. Purified polysaccharides did not exhibit direct cytotoxic effects against Helicobacter pylori and did not influence hemagglutination. In a double-blind clinical trial study of 60 patients with peptic ulcer disease, 4 weeks treatment with licorice was found to be as effective as bismuth in Helicobacter pylori eradication (Momeni et al. 2014). They suggested that in patients whom bismuth was contraindicated, licorice could be used safely instead. In a double-blind study of 40 patients with peptic ulcer, licorice was found to be a good a replacement for bismuth sub-nitrate in treatment of peptic ulcer in a quadruple therapy comprising amoxicillin (500 mg, 3 times/day after diet for 15 days), metronidazole (250 mg, 4 times/day after diet for 15 days), omeprazole (20 mg, 2 times/day \u00bd h before the diet for 30 days) and licorice (250 mg, 3 times/day \u00bd h before the diet for 30 days).

Glycyrrhizin was able to upregulate the expression of CD40, CD86 and MHC-\u0406\u0406 maturation markers on dendritic cells (DCs) (Bordbar et al. 2012). DCs treated with glycyrrhizin enhanced proliferation of allogeneic T cells along with the production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 cytokines and reduced IL-4 production. The data indicated that glycyrrhizin had the capacity to upregulate allostimulatory activity of professional antigen presenting DCs and conduct immune responses toward a T helper 1 response.",

Similar to estradiol-17\u03b2 (E2), glabridin stimulated DNA synthesis in human endothelial cells (ECV-304; E304) and had a bi-phasic effect on proliferation of human vascular smooth muscle cells. In animal studies, in intact females or after ovariectomy, glabridin similar to E2 stimulated the specific activity of creatine kinase in aorta and in left ventricle of the heart. Raloxifene inhibited glabridin as well as E2 activities. Glabrene, on the other hand, had only the stimulatory effect on DNA synthesis in vascular cells, with no inhibition by raloxifene, suggesting a different mechanism of action. The authors suggested the use of glabrene with or without E2 as a new agent for modulation of vascular injury and atherogenesis for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in post-menopausal women. In pre-menopausal human bone cells, the response to estradiol-17\u03b2 and glabridin (at higher concentration) was higher than in post-menopausal cells; whereas, glabrene (at higher concentration) was more effective in post-menopausal cells (Somjen et al. 2004a). At both ages, the response to estradiol-17\u03b2 and glabridin was enhanced by pretreatment with the less-calcemic Vitamin D analogue CB 1093 (CB) and the demonstrably non-calcemic analogue JK 1624 F(2)-2 (JKF). The response to glabrene was reduced by this pretreatment. Both glabridin and glabrene stimulated creatine kinase specific activity in diaphyseal bone and epiphyseal cartilage of prepubertal female rats. Daily feeding (3\u201314 days) of prepubertal female rats with glabridin, estradiol-17\u03b2 or their combination also stimulated creatine kinase specific activity. Glabridin, similarly to estradiol-17\u03b2, also stimulated creatine kinase specific activity in ovariectomized female rats. Raloxifene, in combination with glabridin or estradiol-17\u03b2, demonstrated the phenomenon of mutual annihilation of stimulation of creatine kinase specific activity in both epiphysis and diaphysis. Glabrene activity was not inhibited by raloxifene. They found that glabridin showed greater similarity to estradiol-17\u03b2 and thus greater potential, with or without Vitamin D, to modulate bone disorders in post-menopausal women. In a study, nine healthy women 22\u201326 years old, in the luteal phase of the cycle were given 3.5 g of a commercial preparation of licorice (containing 7.6 % w.w. of glycyrrhizic acid) daily for two cycles (Armanini et al. 2004). It was found that licorice could reduce total serum testosterone probably due to the block of 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17\u201320 lyase. It was concluded that licorice could be considered an adjuvant therapy of hirsutism and polycystic ovary syndrome.",

(2007) found that activation of rapid signalling pathways, including Erk1/2 and Akt, and the subsequent transcriptional regulation were involved in the proliferation of MCF-7 cells induced by the extract of G. glabra root. The extract had similar activity to that induced by 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), although glycyrrhizin did not show such an activity. Furthermore, the extract had estrogenic activity and a distinguishable profile of gene expression, suggesting the presence of potentially useful components other than glycyrrhizin in G. glabra root for hormone and anti-cancer therapies. In in-vivo studies, administration of alcoholic G. glabra extract at doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg exerted significant reduction of prostate weight, total serum testosterone and ventral prostate epithelium/stroma ratio in immature male rats (Zamansoltani et al. 2009). Increase in testosterone metabolism, downregulation of androgen receptors or activation of estrogen receptors could be the mechanisms involved. Most fraction of the ethyl acetate G. glabra root extract showed some estrogenicity on both human estrogen receptors (ER) \u03b1 and \u03b2 (Simons et al. 2011). A compound was considered a phytoestrogen when it activates the ER at concentrations \u2264104 times than that of estradiol (E2). The main flavonoids in the fractions were glabrene, glabrone, glabridin, glabrol 4\u2032-mehtyl-glabridin, 3\u2032-hydroxy-4-O-methyl-glabridin, hispaglabridin A and hispaglabridin B. Fractions F16-20, rich in glabrene, showed a predominant estrogenic activity on the ER\u03b1. Several fractions displayed higher responses than the maximum response obtained with the reference compound, the natural hormone 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2). In addition to glabrene, the estrogenic activity of licorice roots extract had been ascribed to the presence of glabridin and its derivatives. Glabridin did not exert agonistic activity to both ER subtypes. Prenylation of isoflavonoids had been suggested to induce antagonism towards the ER\u03b1. The estrogenic activities of all fractions, including this so-called superinduction, were clearly ER-mediated, as the estrogenic response was inhibited by 20\u201360 % known ER antagonists, and no activity was found in yeast cells that did not express the ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2 subtype. Prolonged exposure of the yeast to the estrogenic fractions that showed superinduction did not, contrary to E2, result in a decrease of the fluorescent response. Glabridin displayed ER\u03b1-selective antagonism, similar to the ER\u03b1-selective antagonist RU 58668. Whereas glabridin was able to reduce the estrogenic response of E2 by approximately 80 % at 6 \u00d7 10\u22126 M, glabrene-rich fractions only exhibited agonistic responses, preferentially on ER\u03b1.",

When the glycyrrhizin and dexamethasone groups were compared, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the histopathologic parameters, including thickness of basement membrane, subepithelial smooth muscle, and epithelium and number of mast and goblet cells. Oral administration of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) (50 and 100 mg/kg b.wt.) significantly protected against benzo(a)pyrene-induced debilities in lungs of Wistar rats against B(a)P induced debilities in lungs of Wistar rats (Qamar et al. 2012). GA protected lung epithelium by suppression of caspases activities in lung tissue and reduction of total protein, total cells, elastase activity, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase activities along with fortification of phospholipids in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Studies by Dai et al. (2013) found that liquiritigenin could protect human lung cells (A549) from Staphylococcus aureus \u03b1-haemolysin-mediated injury. Low concentrations of liquiritigenin remarkably decreased Staphylococcus aureus \u03b1-haemolysin production in a dose-dependent manner.",

The data indicated that GU-7 inhibited platelet aggregation by increasing intraplatelet cAMP concentration. Isoliquiritigenin, a new aldose reductase inhibitor purified from licorice (Glycyrrhizae radix), inhibited platelet aggregation (Tawata et al. 1992). It significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of 40,000- and 20,000-Da proteins, and inhibited the formation of 12 (S)-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and thromboxane B2. The inhibitory effect of isoliquiritigenin on platelet aggregation in-vitro was comparable to that of aspirin. It was suggested that isoliquiritigenin elicited an anti-platelet action by inhibiting not only cyclooxygenase but also lipoxygenase or peroxidase activity in platelets. Since the hyperaggregability of platelets had been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, isoliquiritigenin may offer a unique benefit as an aldose reductase inhibitor. Isoliquiritigenin, glabridin, licoarylcoumarin, glycycoumarin, glycyrol, licoricone and licoricidin were identified as strong inhibitors of adenosine 3\u2032, 5\u2032-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase in waste materials which were obtained during the industrial extraction of glycyrrhizin from licorice roots (Kusano et al. 1991).

It was also shown that UVB-induced pigmentation and erythema in the skins of guinea pigs were inhibited by topical applications of 0.5 % glabridin. Anti-inflammatory effects of glabridin in-vitro were also shown by its inhibition of superoxide anion productions and cyclooxygenase activities. By replacing each of the hydroxyl groups of glabridin with others, it was revealed that the inhibitory effect of 2\u2032-O-ethyl glabridin was significantly stronger than that of 4\u2032-O-ethyl-glabridin on melanin synthesis in cultured B16 cells at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. The 50 % tyrosinase-inhibitory concentration of the Glycyrrhiza glabra methanol extract was 21.2 \u03bcg/ml (Khanom et al. 2000). A glabridin derivative, 3\u2033,4\u2033-dihydroglabridin exhibited higher tyrosinase inhibitory activity than glabridin (IC50 value = 11.40 \u03bcM), which was probably due to the 4-substituted resorcinol skeleton and the lacking of double bond between carbon atom 3\u2033 and 4\u2033 on its structure giving more conformational flexibility to interact with the enzyme more effectively (Jirawattanapong et al. 2009). In addition, various acylated derivatives were synthesized as glabridin prodrugs. The chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis of prodrugs revealed that the diacetate ester was rapidly hydrolysed by porcine liver esterase with the half-life of 2.36 min, while that of the dihexanoate was 14.8 h.",

Pretreatment with DHC-1, a herbal formulation derived from Bacopa monnieri, Emblica officinalis, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Mangifera indica and Syzygium aromaticum protected arts against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction and cisplatin-induced renal damage (Bafna and Balaraman 2005). This beneficial effect may be attributed, at least in part, to its antioxidant activity. Glycyrrhizin was demonstrated to attenuate renal I/R injury in mice via administration of glycyrrhizin, which suppressed the serum levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen 6 h following reperfusion; furthermore, the superoxide anions as well as the activity of superoxide dismutase within renal tissues was reduced by glycyrrhizin pretreatment (Ye et al. 2014). Further, the protein level of cleaved caspase-3, as well as its activity in renal tissue, was suppressed as a result of the glycyrrhizin pretreatment, indicating that glycyrrhizin inhibited I/R-induced renal cell apoptosis. Additionally, glycyrrhizin pretreatment appeared to ameliorate I/R-induced renal injury via inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6. The results suggested that glycyrrhizin provided significant protection against I/R-induced renal injury in mice by inhibiting inflammatory responses and renal cell apoptosis.",

In another prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 10 haemodialysis patients, administration of cookies or bread rolls supplemented with glycyrrhetinic acid for 6 months significantly lowered serum potassium levels (Farese et al. 2009).

Moreover, glabridin (50 \u03bcM) decreased the TNF-alpha-induced production of prostaglandin E2 and nitric oxide in osteoblasts. The data indicated that the enhancement of osteoblast function by glabridin may result in the prevention for osteoporosis and inflammatory bone diseases. Liquiritigenin protected osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells from antimycin A-induced cell death (Choi et al. 2014). It was found that modulation of PI3K, antioxidant effects and the attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction by liquiritigenin represent an important mechanism for its protection of osteoblasts against cytotoxicity resulting from mitochondrial oxidative stress. Glabridin attenuated 2-deoxy-d-ribose(dRib)-induced oxidative cell damage in MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblastic cells (Kim et al. 2013). Treatment with glabridin resulted in a significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, collagen contents and osteoblast differentiation genes [ALP, collagen, osteopontin (OPN), osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteocalcin (OC)] and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) genes (BMP2, BMP4 and BMP7). Glabridin activated dRib-induced decreased expression of phosphatidylinositol 3\u2032-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B 2 (AKT2) genes, master regulators of survival-related signalling pathways. Glabridin also upregulated the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which were inhibited by dRib. The results suggested that glabridin may be useful for the treatment of diabetes-related bone disease.",

Twenty percent of women treated with spironolactone and none treated with the addition of licorice complained of symptoms related to volume depletion. Consistently, the activation of the renin-aldosterone system was significantly lower during spironolactone plus licorice than with spironolactone alone. The prevalence of metrorrhagia was lower in the combined therapy. The results suggested that in patients with PCOS the mineralocorticoid properties of licorice could reduce the prevalence of side effects related to the diuretic activity of spironolactone.",

However, the aqueous solution of \u03b2-glycyrrhizin formed an extremely rigid gel in acidic media, whereas \u03b1-glycyrrhizin showed no sign of gelation. \u03b2-glycyrrhizin could emulsify various oily materials over a wide range of required HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) values, while \u03b1-glycyrrhizin had solubilizing ability for several perfume materials. Results from a series of experiments on the solubilizing, emulsifying and gelling mechanisms of \u03b1- and \u03b2-glycyrrhizin suggested that the \u03b2-glycyrrhizin molecule which was found to be cyclically constructed constituted the micelies which in turn orient anisotropically to form a rigid gel and to stabilize the emulsion. Based on the already described properties, \u03b1-glycyrrhizin should be utilized as a solubilizer, and \u03b2-glycyrrhizin as an emulsifier and a stabilizer in cosmetics. Baltina et al. (1996) separated cis (18\u03b2) and trans (18\u03b1) isomers of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) from G. glabra root. The two GA isomers possess close physicochemical compositions, but trans-GA differed from the cis-isomer by higher solubility in water, higher stability of the aqueous solutions and lack of gel formation in these solutions. Trans-GA was of interest as a surfactant and solubilizing agent for the production of cosmetics and stabilized water-soluble medication forms.",

The excretion rates of nitrofurantoin were significantly higher in patients receiving the drug with liquorice and also side effects were minimal. There was no significant difference in the excretion rates of the drug with addition of liquorice in healthy volunteers. Lin et al. (2009) caution the licorice or its component glycyrrhetic acid with methotrexate, the immunosuppressant. They found the AUC (area under the curve) and MRT (mean residence time) of methotrexate were significantly increased by licorice and glycyrrhetic acid in rats. Hou et al. (2012) found that licorice and glycyrrhizin significantly decreased the peak blood concentration and the areas under the curves of the immunosuppressant cyclosporine in rats. It was concluded that liquorice significantly reduced the oral bioavailability of cyclosporine through activating P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). In a two-phase randomized crossover design, placebo controlled study of 16 healthy male subjects, volunteers were given placebo or glycyrrhizin for 14 days and midazolam on the 15th day (Tu et al. 2010a). Glycyrrhizin reduced the AUC of imidazole in blood plasma, indicating a modest induction of CYP3A by glycyrrhizin. In another two-phase randomized crossover study of healthy Chinese male volunteers with different CYP2C19 genotypes, eighteen healthy subjects (six CYP2C19*1/*1, five CYP2C19*1/*2, one CYP2C19*1/*3, five CYP2C19*2/*2 and one CYP2C19*2/*3) were given placebo or glycyrrhizin salt tablet 150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks followed by omeprazole on the 15th day (Tu et al. 2010b). After 14-day treatment of glycyrrhizin, plasma omeprazole significantly decreased, and those of omeprazole sulfone significantly increased. However, plasma concentrations of 5-hydroxyomeprazole did not significantly change. The ratio of AUC(0-infinity) of omeprazole to omeprazole sulfone decreased by 43.93 % in CYP2C19*1/*1; 44.85 % in CYP2C19*1/*2 or *3 and 36.16 % in CYP2C19*2/*2 or *3 while those of omeprazole to 5-hydroxyomeprazole did not change significantly in all three genotypes. No significant differences in glycyrrhizin response were found among CYP2C19 genotypes. Glycyrrhizin induced CYP3A4-catalysed sulfoxidation of omeprazole leading to decreased omeprazole plasma concentrations, but had no significant impact on CYP2C19-dependent hydroxylation of omeprazol. Glycyrrhetinic acid was found to be a mixed inhibitor of the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A), with an IC50 of 7.25 \u03bcmol/l, a Km of 4.3 \u03bcmol/l and a Ki of 6.4 \u03bcmol/l (Li et al. 2010). CYP3A activity was also affected by intragastric administration of glycyrrhetinic acid, which resulted in increases in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)0-t and in apparent elimination half-time (t1/2) and significant decreases in body clearance, as well as in the formation of 1-hydroxy-midazolam after intragastric or intravenous administration of midazolam. The results suggested the likelihood of an interaction between glycyrrhetinic acid and CYP3A-metabolized drugs in humans and indicated that liquorice root should be used with caution when taken concomitantly with other drugs that interact with CYP3A.",

The inhibitory action of glycyrrhetinic acid was observed in CYP2C9 for 4-hydroxylation of diclofenac, CYP2C19 for 4\u2032-hydroxylation of (S)-mephenytoin and CYP3A4 for 1\u2032-hydroxylation of midazolam.

Bernardi et al.

Female participants were slightly more sensitive to glycyrrhizinic acid than male participants. In a subsequent double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled study by Bijlsma et al.

The European Commission Scientific Committee on Food (2003) deemed that the NOAEL obtained in the study by Bijlsma and co-workers was more appropriate as the study encompassed a larger sample of volunteers (40 volunteers in contrast to 24 volunteers), a longer period of exposure (8 weeks in contrast to 4 weeks) and inclusion of a placebo control group.",

In these human studies at three dose levels, there were no clinically noteworthy changes in haematological or related biochemical parameters. All clinical events observed were mild and considered to be unrelated to LFO administration even after repeated administration for 4 weeks.

(1966) reported an obese patient striving to reduce weight ingested excessive amount of licorice leading to severe potassium depletion and acute myopathy and myoglobinuria. Hypertension, initially normokalaemic, was eventually associated with hypokalaemia, alkalosis, suppressed plasma renin activity and aldosteronopenia in a 58-year-old man who had ingested two to three 36-gm licorice candy bars daily for 6 years to 7 years (Conn et al. 1968). Metabolic balance studies recorded complete recovery upon cessation of licorice ingestion. Holmes et al. (1970) reported a case of a 63-year-old man with pseudohyperaldosteronism induced by habitual ingestion of liquorice (3.5 lb licorice for the last 15\u201320 years). Chamberlain (1970) described a case of a previously healthy 53-year-old male patient who presented with fulminant congestive heart failure (CHF) after ingesting large quantities of licorice for a week. Kuriyama et al. (1975) described a patient who developed marked hypokalaemia due to chronic administration of glycyrrhizin (150 mg daily). Bannister et al. (1977) reported a case of a 58-year-old women with cardiac arrest associated with hypokalaemia caused by ingesting 1.8 kg of liquorice a week. Three months after stopping liquorice, she remained well and all laboratory values were normal. Takeda et al. (1979) reported the natural recovery from the aggravated hypertension, hypokalaemia and suppression of the renin-aldosterone axis after the glycyrrhizin discontinuation in two mild hypertensive women aged 71 and 68 years, who had been administered 273\u2013546 mg glycyrrhizin daily for 1.5 and 6 months, respectively, for the treatment of liver disease. About one month after the glycyrrhizin discontinuation, acceleration of hypertension, hypokalaemia and suppression of the renin-aldosterone system still continued in both patients. About one and a half months later, the improvements of aggravated hypertension, hypokalaemia and suppressed renin-aldosterone system gradually occurred in both patients. The results demonstrated that both patients had a prolongation of the syndrome resembling primary aldosteronism except the low plasma aldosterone level about 1 month after the glycyrrhizin discontinuation. A man 85 years old, who habitually swallowed saliva while chewing tobacco leaf containing about 8.3 % (w/w) liquorice paste with a glycyrrhizinic acid content of 0.15 %, developed the classical syndrome of exogenous mineralocorticoid excess: hypokalaemia, hypertension, renal potassium wasting, metabolic acidosis, sodium retention and low plasma rennin (Blachley and Knochel 1980). Cuspidi et al. (1981) reported four female subjects with a form of severe systo-diastolic hypertension, recalcitrant to previous anti-hypertensive treatment, accompanied by marked hypokalaemia caused by habitual licorice ingestion. Abstinence from licorice led to normalization of kalemia in a period varying from 6 to 15 days, while arterial pressure values and all other essential parameters examined (plasma renin activity, etc.) recovered their balance more slowly. A 54-year-old man was admitted to hospital with acute rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria due to hypokalaemia caused by chronic licorice ingestion and diuretic treatment (Heidemann and Kreuzfelder 1983). The myoglobinaemia led to a glomerulopathy and tubulopathy, however there was no clinical evidence of acute renal failure. Four cases of pseudohyperaldosteronism due to chronic ingestion of liquorice-containing laxatives were described (Scali et al. 1990). All patients had hypertension and hypokalaemia with suppression of plasma renin activity and aldosterone.",

Okada et al. (1987) reported a case of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome associated with hypokalaemic myopathy due to glycyrrhizin. Chubachi et al. (1992) reported the case of a 72-year-old man who developed acute renal failure (ARF) following severe hypokalaemic rhabdomyolysis; the hypokalaemia was due to chronic glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizic acid) administration. Caradonna et al. (1992) reported a patient with acute rhabdomyolysis and absence of myoadenylate deaminase (MADA) associated with chronic licorice intoxication. These were completely reversed with potassium supplementation and licorice withdrawal. A case of a 55-year-old man of hypertension and hypokalaemia was reported by Kageyama (1992). He had been administered glycyrrhizin from 1 year before admission for the treatment of chronic hepatitis. His blood pressure, potassium, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration returned to normal within about 4 weeks after discontinuation of the glycyrrhizin. Re-administration of glycyrrhizin caused increases in plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA). His urinary cortisol excretion was increased and urinary cortisone excretion decreased, while his serum cortisol level remained unchanged. The results suggested that increased renal cortisol as a result of decreased conversion to cortisone might play an important role in the development of pseudoaldosteronism as well as in its own mineralocorticoid activity. Corsi et al. (1983) reported a 35-year-old man who had been ingesting one or two bags of tablets of pure licorice daily (20\u201340 g/day) for about 2 years, developed an acute myopathy with high levels of serum muscle enzymes and the typical features of mineralocorticoid excess: serious hypokalaemia, hypertension and metabolic alkalosis. Both plasma renin and serum aldosterone were below the normal values. Van der Zwan (1993) reported a 15-year-old boy who developed a hypertension encephalopathy after ingestion of 0.5 kg liquorice candy. He recovered completely in the course of 5 months.",

(1993) reported a case of chronic intoxication with glycyrrhizinic acid, at a dosage of 1000\u20131500 mg per month over a period of 11 months, in a former alcoholic. This intoxication was revealed by profound hypokalaemia and rhabdomyolysis but blood pressure remained constantly normal. A 78-year-old Japanese man hospitalized because of muscular weakness and acute renal failure was diagnosed to suffer from licorice-induced pseudoaldosteronism that produced hypokalaemic rhabdomyolysis, resulting in acute renal failure and profound deposition of calcium into the damaged skeletal and cardiac muscles (Saito et al. 1994). Brayley and Jones (1994) described a 29-year-old female patient who presented with acute severe hypokalaemia after increasing her licorice consumption from 300 to 600 g/day. She had a history of anorexia nervosa with bulimia. Berlango Jim\u00e9nez et al. (1995) presented the case of a 36-year-old patient who, as the result of the intake of five daily licorice sticks (25 g/day) for a month, developed analytical and clinical signs of acute rhabdomyolysis characterized by typical disorders of mineralocorticoid excess, such as severe hypokalaemia, arterial hypertension and metabolic alkalosis. Heikens et al. (1995) described of a 40-year-old female with severe hypertension and hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis, due to prolonged liquorice ingestion. They suggested that glycyrrhetinic acid, the hydrolytic metabolite of glycyrrhizic acid, was the active component of liquorice which caused inhibition of the peripheral metabolism of cortisol. Cortisol had been found to bind with the same affinity as aldosterone to the mineralocorticoid receptor resulting in a hypermineralocorticoid condition. Ingestion of liquorice may therefore result in retention of sodium and water, hypertension, hypokalaemia, alkalosis and suppression of the renin-aldosterone system.",

Doeker and Andler (1999) reported an 11-year-old boy who had hypoparathyroidism and Addison\u2019s disease. The boy reported an excessive daily intake of 300\u2013400 g liquorice corresponding to 600\u2013800 mg glycyrrhizic acid because of salt craving. After complete withdrawal of liquorice, all symptoms of hypermineralocorticoidism diminished and growth velocity increased. Ishikawa et al.

The patient presented with difficulty in holding her head up and proximal-dominant tetraparesis with significant laterality. The general reflexes were decreased, and the bilateral Chaddock\u2019s reflexes were repeatedly positive. They found that the pathologic reflex was caused by the aggravation of cervical spondylotic myelopathy due to neck weakness and that tetraparesis with laterality was caused by hypokalaemic myopathy.

Yorgun et al. (2010) reported a 50-year-old woman who was admitted to the emergency department with an aborted cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation and electrocardiographic changes consistent with Brugada syndrome due to liquorice-induced hypokalaemia. Licorice consumption was found to be the cause of a posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in a 49-year-old woman admitted to hospital because of thunderclap headache and blurred vision (van Beers et al. 2011). The combination of sequential computed tomography (CT) and the triad of hypertension, hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis in this patient suggested the diagnosis. Omar et al. (2012) reported a 35-year-old man from Egypt, with no past medical history, who presented to the emergency room with progressive weakness that started in his lower extremities and quickly progressed to involve the upper limbs. He was diagnosed with hypokalaemic myopathy due to excessive licorice ingestion. Celik et al. (2012) reported a case of an association of hypokalaemia, oedema and thrombocytopenia that was developed due to the excessive intake of licorice. Nielsen et al. (2012) described a 50-year-old woman with hypertension and hypokalaemia-induced limb paresis due to chronic liquorice ingestion. The patient was treated with potassium supplementation and spironolactone. Her blood pressure and electrolyte status normalized within a month after cessation of liquorice intake. A 47-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with a history of asthenia, periorbital and lower limbs oedema, associated with hypokalaemia and increased blood pressure levels (Robles et al. 2013). It was revealed that she had been consuming several sachets of raw liquorice lollies obtained from a herbalist a month ago and clinical tests established the cause to liquorice poisoning. During the patient\u2019s stay at the hospital, liquorice was stopped and potassium supplements were started. Subsequently, a week after, the patient fully recovered without any significant sequelae. O\u2019Connell et al.

All patients showed normal renin, angiotensin and aldosterone values 2\u20134 months later, however, indicating that long-term suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis was uncommon despite several years of liquorice ingestion. Ingestion of licorice, 100 g daily for 8 weeks, caused a rise of 81 % in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration in 12 healthy subjects (Forslund et al. 1989). The plasma concentrations of antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone and plasma renin activity decreased. Blood pressure increased transiently and two subjects developed reversible hypertension. The rise in plasma ANP concentration during ingestion of licorice may be considered a physiological response to prevent fluid retention and development of hypertension.",

Oral administration of carbenoxolone or glycyrrhizic acid caused saline polydipsia and polyuria typical of chronic systemic mineralocorticoid excess, and the icv licorice derivatives produced hypertension without affecting saline appetite. The findings provided additional evidence for a central role in blood pressure control by mineralocorticoids that was distinct from their renal effects. They also suggested that more was involved in licorice-induced hypertension than only inhibition of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Hayashi et al. (1992b) reported two patients with hypokalaemic myopathy induced by the administration of glycyrrhizin, 270\u2013273 mg per day for a period of 2 and 8 months, respectively. Myotonic and repetitive discharges were observed when the serum chloride level fell below 90 mEq/l, and these discharges disappeared following administration of KCl. The findings supported the causal role of hypochloremia in myotonic discharges. Shintani et al. (1992) reported 59 cases of glycyrrhizin (licorice)-induced hypokalaemic myopathy (GIHM). In many cases, conditions leading to the onset of GIHM were habitual licorice ingestion, ingestion of antituberculosis agents containing licorice and long-term ingestion of licorice-containing agents for chronic gastritis, chronic hepatitis or chronic dermatitis. The main clinical symptom was flaccid quadriplegia in almost all cases, with muscle pain in 32.2 % and peripheral dysesthesia in the extremities, manifested mainly by numbness (27.1 %). Muscle biopsy was performed in 17 of the 59 cases with resultant findings of myopathic changes consisting mainly of phagocytosis, necrotic fibres, vacuolar degeneration, together with sporadic neurogenic changes. Complete cure was attained in 57 of the 59 cases of GIHM by discontinued ingestion of glycyrrhizin (licorice) and potassium supplement.",

Glycyrrhizic and glycyrrhetinic acids administration to rats in-vivo (75 mg/kg. day for 5 days) resulted in inhibition of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2 HSD) activity, but also a significant reduction in steady state 11 \u03b2 HSD mRNA levels in both predominantly mineralocorticoid (kidney and distal colon) and glucocorticoid (liver and pituitary) target tissues (Whorwood et al. 1993). In-vitro, 11\u03b2HSD mRNA and activity were present in rat pituitary GH3 cells (81 % conversion of corticosterone to 11-dehydrocorticosterone/4 \u00d7 106 cells after 24-h incubation) and inhibited by glycyrrhizic and glycyrrhetinic acids. Oral administration of a water freeze-dried extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) at doses of 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg in rats induced dose-dependent and mostly significant decreases in the plasma concentration of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, aldosterone and potassium (K) (Al-Qarawi et al. 2002). The results suggested a strong and dose-dependent suppression of the adrenal-pituitary axis, accompanied by stimulation of renin production from the kidney. Cal\u00f2 et al. (2004) reported a direct, mineralocorticoid-mediated effect on the protein expression of two markers of oxidative stress after incubation of mononuclear leukocytes with 1 \u00d7 10\u22128 M aldosterone (p22(phox)/\u03b2-actin = 1.38 and PAI-1/\u03b2-actin = 1.80). The same effect was also found with 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 M glycyrrhetinic acid, the principal constituent of licorice root (p22(phox)/\u03b2-actin = 1.37 and PAI-1/\u03b2-actin = 1.80).

In a subgroup of 13 women the consumption of 50 g of liquorice daily also caused a significant rise in SBP of 5.6 mmHg (P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure of 3.4 mmHg. A significant change in the cortisol/cortisone ratio in urine was observed during 100 g liquorice consumption indicating inhibition of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in kidneys. In another study of healthy Caucasian volunteers, consumption of licorice in various doses, 50\u2013200 g/day, for 2\u20134 weeks, corresponding to a daily intake of 75\u2013540 mg glycyrrhetinic acid, was found to increase systolic blood pressure in a dose\u2013response relationship (Sigurj\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2001).

In a clinical study, six male volunteers taking daily 7 g of a commercial preparation of licorice for 7 days, corresponding to an intake of 500 mg/day of glycyrrhizic acid developed pseudohyperaldosteronism during the treatment characterized by increase of body weight, suppression of plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone and reduction of serum potassium (Armanini et al. 1996). The authors concluded that the pseudohyperaldosteronism from licorice was initially related to decreased activity of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase and afterwards also a direct effect of licorice derivatives on mineralocorticoid receptors becomes evident in some cases. Results of studies by Ohtake et al. (2007) suggested that accumulation of 3-monoglucuronyl-glycyrrhetinic acid (3MGA), a metabolite of glycyrrhizin, in the plasma may be involved in the pathogenesis of pseudoaldosteronism induced by chronic glycyrrhizin treatment. Studies by Makino et al. (2012) suggested that 3MGA was actively transported into tubules through organic anion transporters (OATs), resulting in the inhibition of type 2 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD2). As the plasma level of 3MGA depended on the function of hepatic transporters, monitoring 3MGA levels in plasma or urine may be useful for preventing pseudoaldosteronism when licorice or GL was prescribed to patients. Celik et al. (2012) presented a case report on an association of hypokalaemia, oedema and thrombocytopenia that was developed due to the excessive intake of licorice.",

Further they found that maternal prenatal licorice consumption altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPAA) function in children (R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen et al. 2010) and may increase risk of adult disease. Their findings lend support to prenatal \u2018programming\u2019 of HPAA function by overexposure to glucocorticoids.",

Highest levels of ochratoxin A were found in dry licorice root, averaging 63.6 ng/g, while mean contents in fresh licorice root were 9.2 ng/g. Licorice-confectionery (sweets) contained 3.8 ng/g of ochratoxin A. Ochratoxin A was also abundant in two licorice derivatives, liquid licorice extract (16.0 ng/g) and solid licorice block (39.5 ng/g). The ochratoxin levels found in licorice and derived products are higher than those reported in the literature for other food commodities. The experiments of ochratoxin A transfer into the tea beverages showed that almost 5 % of the ochratoxin A present in dry licorice root is transferred to the corresponding decoction tea, whereas only 1 % of ochratoxin A remains in infusion tea.",

Licorice is deemed emollient, expectorant, laxative, moderately pectoral and tonic (Grieve 1971; Launert 1981; Uphof 1968). Liquorice root is taken internally in the treatment of Addison\u2019s disease, asthma, bronchitis, coughs, peptic ulcer, arthritis, allergic complaints and following steroidal therapy (Bown 1995). Liquorice should be used in moderation and should not be prescribed for pregnant women or people with high blood pressure, kidney disease or taking digoxin-based medication (Bown 1995). Prolonged usage raises the blood pressure and causes water retention (Chiej 1984; Bown 1995). Externally, the root is used in the treatment of herpes, eczema and shingles (Bown 1995).",

Licorice is clinically used for the treatment of stomach ulcers 10, 11. Its preparations are used as a conditioning and flavouring agent in tobacco products. Aqueous extracts from the roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra are widely used for treatment of stomach ulcer (Wittschier et al. 2009). Glycyrrhizin has long been used in China in the treatment of various liver diseases to lower transaminases (Ren et al. 2013). Glycyrrhizin, a major component of a herb (licorice), has been widely used to treat chronic hepatitis B in Japan (Takahara et al. 1994). Licorice is the most common ingredient of traditional Japanese Kampo medicines (Hayashi and Sudo 2009). The minimum content of glycyrrhizin in these medicines should be 2.5 % according to the standards of the Japanese Pharmacopeia. Glycyrrhizin is a prescription drug used in the treatment of liver and allergic diseases in Japan. It is manufactured as an injectable preparation (Stronger Neo-Minophagen\u00ae C) and in a tablet form (Glycyron\u00ae) by a Japanese company, namely, Minophagen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Stronger Neo-Minophagen\u00ae C has been available in the Japanese market for over 60 years. Glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetinic acid and licorice extracts are used in various over-the-counter drugs, including anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory drugs. In addition, in England, the glycyrrhetinic acid derivative glycyrrhetinic acid 3-\u03b2-O-hemisuccinate (carbenoxolone) is a prescription drug used in the treatment of peptic ulcers.",
