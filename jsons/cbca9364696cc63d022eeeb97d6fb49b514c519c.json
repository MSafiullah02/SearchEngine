This family is made up of the genus Pneumovirus, which includes hRSV, and the genus Metapneumovirus, which includes two viral species: hMPV and avian pneumovirus.

The annual rate of hospitalization associated with hMPV infections is 1 per 1,000 children, which is lower than that reported for hRSV infections, but the same as the rate of hospitalization associated with the influenza virus. 19 The rates of clinic and emergency department visits due to hMPV infections are 55 per 1,000 and 13 per 1,000 children, respectively. 19 The rate of hMPV detection in adults is usually lower than that in children and is approximately 3% in the general community. 20 These data suggest that the majority of hMPV infections occur early in childhood with high susceptibility rates in children younger than 2 years old. 21 Heikkinen et al have found that the incidence of hMPV infections in children younger than 2 years is approximately twice the incidence observed in children between 2 and 5 years of age and ten times higher than the incidence among children older than 9 years. 22 The first hMPV infection appears to take place at the age of 6 months, although during this period, the documented presence of maternally derived specific antibodies seems to be protective against infection. 23 Compared with infections with hRSV, hMPV infections tend to occur in slightly older children. 8, 24 However, seroprevalence studies revealed that more than 90% of children younger than 5 years have already been infected by hMPV. 21 Most of the infected children were previously healthy, although the risk of severe disease appears higher in patients with an underlying medical condition. 8, 10, [25] [26] [27] Reports of hMPV infections in otherwise healthy adults are relatively rare; almost 100% of young adults are seropositive for hMPV with stable neutralizing titers. 5 Despite this fact, recurrences are most frequently observed in older adults (65 years) and in patients with a comorbid illness, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cancer, or lung transplantation.

Following membrane fusion, viral ribonucleoprotein containing the negative-sense viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm. Genomic RNA can serve as a matrix for viral transcription and replication. The newly produced proteins associate with viral genome copies to form nucleocapsids, which will be incorporated into the virions as they bud from the surface of the cell membrane. 32 Infected cells may also form syncytia via a mechanism similar to that observed for hRSV. 33 Several animal models have been developed to study hMPV infections, including mice, cotton rats, and primates. hMPV replicates to varying extents in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of these animals, but clinical symptoms have been observed only in chimpanzees. 34 hMPV infection increases perivascular and peribronchiolar infiltration and induces inflammatory changes and the formation of intra-alveolar foamy and hemosiderin macrophages. Moreover, alveolar damage and smudge cells have been observed. 35 One study reported histopathologic changes during hMPV infection in young patients. 33 The bronchoalveolar lavage samples and lung biopsy specimens of these patients displayed epithelial cell degeneration or necrosis with detached ciliary tufts and round red cytoplasmic inclusions, frequent neutrophils, and mucus.",

The inflammatory reaction following viral infection most likely leads to a partial or complete obstruction of the Eustachian tubes, which increases the risk for bacterial invasion of the middle ear. 45, 46 Williams et al have found that one-third of the pediatric hMPVassociated LRTIs have a diagnosis of AOM. 21 In another study, hMPV was detected in 6% of children who presented with AOM as the primary diagnosis; no bacterial pathogen was isolated from 25% of the patients in this study, suggesting that hMPV may be implicated as a unique infectious agent in cases of AOM. 47 hMPV infection has also been associated with febrile seizures, rash, diarrhea, vomiting, and altered liver function. 27 A few reports have suggested a connection with central nervous system diseases, such as encephalitis 48 and status epilepticus. 49 The overall rates of hMPV infection in adults are lower than those described in children. Asymptomatic infections in adults are common, accounting for at least 40% of cases, and young adults usually experience a mild cold or influenza-like symptoms. 50 However, elderly and immunocompromised patients may present with severe pneumonia that may be fatal in some circumstances. 28, 51 In addition, 6 to 12% of COPD exacerbations have been associated with hMPV, and the presence of an underlying lung disease is common in patients hospitalized with hMPV infection. 29, 52, 53 In long-term facilities, a high mortality rate due to hMPV infection is reported. Boivin et al observed a 50% fatality rate in patients of a long-term care facility who had a PCR-confirmed hMPV infection and a 9.4% fatality rate among elderly institutionalized persons with a possible hMPV infection. 54",

Contentin et al described a case of ARDS secondary to hMPV infection in a healthy 58-year-old woman.

Many studies evaluating hMPV infection have tested for the simultaneous presence of other viruses. hRSV was detected in 5 to 17% of patients infected with hMPV. 25,70-72 Most results have not described an exacerbation of the disease when multiple pathogens were detected. However, one study reported a 10-fold increase in risk of admission to the PICU in children coinfected with hRSV and hMPV, and the dual infection has been described as being capable of augmenting severe bronchiolitis. 73 On the other hand, bacterial coinfection is not commonly observed during hMPV infections. hMPV appears primarily as a respiratory pathogen, and the majority of respiratory diseases are not associated with bacterial agents.",

In this group, it is difficult to determine if the disease is more severe. 79 The association between children's ages and disease severity has also been investigated. In the pediatric population, being between 0 and 5 months in age is linked to a higher risk of hospitalization, whereas prematurity and low birth weight are associated with a more frequent occurrence of severe disease in hospitalized patients. 86 Edwards et al conducted surveillance for ARTIs among inpatient and outpatient children younger than 5 years in three U.S. states. 19 They found a correlation between hospitalization for hMPV infection and the presence of other children between 5 and 17 years old in the home. Moreover, members in households of hMPV-positive children fell ill significantly more and required more visits and drug prescriptions than did those in households of hRSV-positive children, with a frequency similar to that observed among members of households where influenza virus infections were present. 71 The presence of an underlying medical condition is a risk factor associated with increased disease severity. Hahn et al found that the chronic lung diseases of prematurity (i.e., bronchopulmonary dysplasia, respiratory distress syndrome), an anatomic or congenital lung disease (i.e., trachea-laryngomalacia), a congenital heart disease, a neuromuscular disorder (i.e., hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, spinal muscular atrophy), and trisomy 21 increase the risk for a more severe disease. 57 Moreover, children with comorbidities who present with an hMPV infection are significantly more likely to be admitted to the PICU. 57 In the case of asthma, a biunique association has been observed. It is known that the previous presence of asthma is a risk factor, predisposing an individual to severe respiratory disease during hMPV infection, but, in the acute phase, hMPV itself can cause wheezing in young children. [87] [88] [89] Bosis et al found that almost 26% of children with hMPV infections presented with wheezing, 71 and Jartti et al reported that hMPV has been detected in 8% of children who were admitted to the hospital with exacerbation of wheezing. 90 hMPV is also associated with an exacerbation of asthma in adult patients who required hospitalization. 88 According to some authors, hMPV plays a role not only in acute asthma exacerbation but also in the development of recurrent wheezing and asthma in the medium term. [91] [92] [93] One retrospective study showed an association between hMPV infection during infancy and the subsequent diagnosis of asthma or another bronchial obstructive disease. 91 The nature of this association remains to be determined, because it is difficult to establish a diagnosis of asthma in the first year of life when wheezing is commonly observed during viral ARTIs. In light of these reflections, further studies are required.",

Apart from advanced age, the major risk factor associated with hMPV infection is the presence of an underlying cardiopulmonary disease, especially COPD. 8, [28] [29] [30] 50, 53, 54, 88, [94] [95] [96] Infections in patients with COPD frequently evolve to become LTRIs, leading to development of fatal respiratory failure. The fundamental reasons for the higher morbidity in older adults have not been determined. The most likely explanation is that aging causes impairment of innate and adaptive immunity. 97 Moreover, inflammation as an exaggerated immune response to viral infection plays an important role in severe disease. 98 Finally, the existence of multiple hMPV lineages may lead to insufficient cross protection against different genotypes. The available data focusing on this aspect have reported conflicting results. 7, 99 Additional studies are necessary to determine the nature of age-related defects in the immune response during hMPV infections and to establish if, after infection with a virus belonging to a single subgroup, cross protection occurs. This last question has a significant implication for vaccine development.",

The development of multiplex RT-PCR has the advantage of supplying a complete panel of respiratory viruses, which allows the detection of coinfections with two or more pathogens, even those with very low VLs. [104] [105] [106] Direct immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are rapid methods to detect respiratory viruses, but they are not as sensitive as the molecular techniques. Because infections with hMPV are universal, serological tests used for the diagnosis of a recent infection are only useful if fourfold increases in antibody titers or a recent seroconversion are demonstrated. 107, 108 The option of serological tests may be useful in epidemiological evaluations to understand the worldwide seroprevalence of hMPV-specific antibodies in both pediatric and adult populations. 109",

            "text": "At present, only ribavirin and immunoglobulins have been used in humans for treatment of hMPV infections. Ribavirin is an analogue of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) that may limit viral transcription and lead to a reduction in the intracellular concentration of GTP. 112 Moreover, it appears to have an immunomodulatory effect in the containment of a viral infection. 112 Immunoglobulins are available in two types of preparations, specific and nonspecific: nonspecific polyclonal immunoglobulins have been administered in severely affected patients, usually along with ribavirin, with conflicting results. 113 Most of the treated cases were adults and children who were heavily immunocompromised because of a malignancy or an HSC or solid-organ transplant: all the patients received oral or, less frequently, intravenous (IV) ribavirin, usually with IV immunoglobulins. 77, [82] [83] [84] 86, [113] [114] [115] [116] The results obtained by Chu et al in a study of immunocompromised children affected by hMPV were negative: patients who received antiviral treatment demonstrated a 22% mortality rate. 85 Dokos et al reported the occurrence of fatal hMPV-associated pneumonia in a 10-year-old girl with chronic graft-versus-host disease despite the administration of IV ribavirin and IV immunoglobulins. 82 Another retrospective study, involving 145 hematologic adult patients infected with paramyxoviruses, suggested that oral ribavirin therapy may not improve clinical outcomes. 114 Positive results have been reported by other authors. Kitanovski et al presented the case of a 2-year-old girl undergoing intensive chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma who developed severe hMPV-associated pneumonia. 115 Rapid and complete recovery has been observed after treatment with oral ribavirin and IV immunoglobulins. Raza et al described a case of hMPV-associated pneumonia in a lung transplant recipient presenting with respiratory failure and sepsis syndrome. 116 The patient was treated with IV ribavirin with a successful outcome. Favorable results have been observed among adult HSC transplant recipients as well. 83, 113 Recently, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb 338) against the hMPV fusion protein has been developed. Studies have shown its preventive and therapeutic efficacy in mice. 117, 118 New frontiers of therapy are directed toward the development of drugs that act by inhibiting the fusion of the virus with the cell membrane. One fusion inhibitor is currently used in the case of HIV-infected patients and has shown promising results against hRSV infection. 119,120 Fusion inhibitors against hMPV have only been employed in animal models. Deffrasnes at al tested several inhibitor peptides that have sequence homology with some domains of the hMPV F protein. One of these peptides has shown efficacy after intranasal administration in mice; these mice appeared to be protected from clinical symptoms and mortality due to hMPV infection. 121 Another interesting approach is based on the natural phenomenon of RNA interference. There are some small, noncoding, endogenous micro-RNA sequences that inhibit the expression of specific genes by avoiding mRNA translation or by inducing mRNA cleavage. The use of exogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that act similarly toward targeted viral genes may produce an inhibitory effect. siRNAs against the hMPV N and P proteins have been tested in vitro with success. 122",
