We treasure memories of growing rice in reverence for soil and life with parents and grandparents. Yet despite all this, and the fact that we are a vast agricultural state, Sabah now produces only a quarter of its rice. We have beautiful rices, but we rely on those from Thailand, Vietnam and Pakistan.",

Most of our smallholders no longer grow or wild harvest their own food, squeezed as they are between declining forests and polluted rivers. Roads eat up padi lands as they take advantage of our valley floors; everywhere low-lying padi land is filled with decomposite rock from \"hill cutting\" as foundation for housing and peri-urban development. How we lost food sovereignty to live in suburbs and become producers of 10% of global oil palm production is a long story. So too is how our public and private sectors-since colonial timesboth caused the problem through promoting the extractive economy model, and tried in vain to turn it around through subsidies.",

Just as we were panicked by (and then forgot) the rice export bans from our key suppliers (Thailand and Vietnam) in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis, so have these COVID-19 times again revealed our dependence. Vietnam banned rice exports last month, and while the state has several months' rice supplies stockpiled, communities have been unable to sell their rubber and palm for the cash to buy rice and other essentials from the supermarkets upon which they are now reliant for subsistence.",

In the first weeks of the Government's Movement Control Order (MCO) it became immediately clear how fragile our whole food system had become. We and many other organizations mobilized to ensure the rural and urban poor -now almost fully dependent on cash economies-were not bereft of basic needs. Aid for our most vulnerable communities is necessary but we must go deeper.",
