            "text": "The 3C-like protease of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus has a C-terminal extra domain in addition to the chymotrypsinfold adopted by piconavirus 3C proteases hosting the complete catalytic machinery. Previously we identified the extra domain to be involved in enzyme dimerization which has been considered essential for the catalytic activity. In an initial attempt to map out the extra-domain residues critical for dimerization, we have systematically generated 15 point mutations, five deletions and one triple mutation and subsequently characterized them by enzymatic assay, dynamic light scattering, CD and NMR spectroscopy. The results led to identification of four regions critical for enzyme dimerization. Interestingly, Asn214Ala mutant with a significant tendency to form a monomer still retained 30% activity, indicating that the relationship between the activity and dimerization might be very complex. Very surprisingly, two regions (one over Ser284-Thr285-Ile286 and another around Phe291) were discovered on which Ala-mutations significantly increased the enzymatic activities. Based on this, a super-active triple-mutant STI \u2044 A with a 3.7-fold activity enhancement was thus engineered by mutating residues Ser284, Thr285 and Ile286 to Ala. The dynamic light scattering, CD and NMR characterizations indicate that the wild-type (WT) and STI \u2044 A mutant share similar structural and dimerization properties, thus implying that in addition to dimerization, the extra domain might have other mechanisms to regulate the catalytic machinery. We rationalized these results based on the enzyme structure and consequently observed an interesting picture: the majority of the dimerization-critical residues plus Ser284-Thr285-Ile286 and Phe291 are clustered together to form a nano-scale channel passing through the central region of the enzyme. We therefore speculate that this channel might play a role in relaying regulatory effects from the extra domain to the catalytic machinery.",

Even at the very beginning, we were puzzled by the existence of a unique domain in the coronavirus 3CL protease in addition to chymotrypsin-fold shared with the piconavirus 3C protease. In fact, the coronavirus 3CL protease with 310 residues was so named previously to highlight its similarity in the structure, enzymatic mechanism and specificity to the picornavirus 3C protease with 180 residues which only form a chymotrypsin-fold hosting the complete catalytic machinery. However, some existing results at that time already implied that the extra domain in the coronavirus 3CL protease might play roles in the enzymatic activity [17, 18] . Therefore, we initiated a domain dissection approach to explore the function of the extra domain which eventually led to the first discovery of its critical involvement in dimerization [19] considered to be essential for the catalytic activity [20] .",

Very interestingly, the replacement of residues Ser284, Thr285, Ile286 or Phe291 by Ala gave rise to the mutated proteases with enzymatic activities higher than that of the wild-type.

            "text": "Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to measure the apparent molecular mass resulting from monomer-dimer equilibrium of the wild-type and mutated proteases at three different NaCl concentrations. As shown in Fig. 2 , the super-active mutant had an apparent molecular mass almost identical to that of the wild-type protease. However, the apparent molecular masses of the mutated proteases in the first group were, on average, 22 kDa smaller than that of the wild-type (56.3 kDa). This observation strongly suggested that these residues play an important role in the enzyme dimerization. Here it is particularly interesting to note that Asn214Ala which still retained 30% of the wild-type proteolytic activity had a small apparent molecular mass (32.6 kDa), indicating that Asn214Ala had a dominant tendency to form a monomer. Therefore, at least four regions of the SARS 3CLp might be significantly associated with enzyme dimerization: (1) the N-terminal residues 1-5 as previously identified [21, 22] ; (2) the residue Asn214; (3) the region around residues Glu288-Asp289-Glu290 which had a close contact with the N-terminus [21, 22] ; and (4) the C-terminal last helix region around residues Arg298-Gln299. Moreover, introduction of higher concentrations of NaCl statistically had no disrupting effect on enzyme dimerization (data not shown), indicating that the reduced activities in the presence of NaCl ( Fig. 1) were not due to the disruption of dimerization.",

A detailed examination of the NMR spectra revealed that the mutants in the first group plus Asn214Ala had spectra with sharper resonance peaks than the wild-type protease, consistent with the observation that these mutants had significantly smaller average relative molecular mass than the wild-type because the NMR resonance peak width is sizedependent and a larger protein will give rise to broader NMR peaks due to the short T2 (transverse relaxation time) [23, 24] . Interestingly, regardless of the DLS relative molecular mass, all mutant proteases gave rise to one but not two sets of upfield resonance peaks similar to the wild-type, indicating that the monomer-dimer equilibrium is a fast exchange process on the NMR time scale [23, 24] .",

As seen in Fig. 5A , the HSQC spectrum of the wild-type protease are very broad and only a small portion of resonance peaks are visible, consistent with our previous report [19] . This is mostly due to the very large relative molecular mass for the wild-type protease in a dimmer-dominant state. Interestingly, the STI \u2044 A mutant had a HSQC spectrum (Fig. 5B ) very similar to that of the wild-type, indicating that both STI \u2044 A and wild-type proteases shared similar structural and dimerization properties. On the other hand, Arg298Ala and ND mutants which were shown by DLS to have a monomer-like relative molecular mass (Fig. 2) had very-dispersed HSQC spectra with many resonance peaks detectable (Figs 5C and E) . This observation indicates that the two mutants were in monomer-dominant states which were also well-structured [25] [26] [27] . When our manuscript was under a previous review, a paper was published in which both ND and LHD mutants were demonstrated to have a great tendency to form a monomer by analytic ultracentrifuge analysis [28] . Interestingly, although here the LHD mutant also had a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum (Fig. 5D) , the visible HSQC resonance peaks were less than those of Arg298Ala and ND mutants. Therefore, in the current case, it appears that the HSQC line-width was modulated both by the average relative molecular mass resulting from fast intermolecular monomerdimer equilibrium as well as by intramolecular conformational exchanges. It is very likely that although the LHD mutant had a dominant tendency to form a monomer [28] , the deletion of the last helix may provoke ls-ms conformational exchanges to some degree which caused some HSQC peaks too broad to be clearly distinguished from the noise signals. However, if the HSQC spectral level was lowered, it could be found that most HSQC peaks of the ND, Glu288Ala, Glu290Ala, Arg298Ala, Gln299Ala, LHD and STI \u2044 A are almost superimposable to those of the wild-type protease, as exemplified by Fig. 5F in which the HSQC spectra of the Arg298Ala and wild-type proteases were superimposed at a lower spectral level. These results, together with CD spectra, indicated that very likely ) over the well-packed regions such as chymotrypsin-fold and the C-terminal extra domain ) no dramatic change occurred for the secondary structures and tertiary structures upon mutation or deletion. However, certainly the mutation and deletion resulted in minor structural changes as well as conformational exchanges on the ls-ms time scale to different degrees which consequently made some HSQC too broad to be detected, as we recently discovered on the CHABII molecule [25, 26] .",

            "text": "Our current results suggest that in addition to wellrecognized N terminus and its contact residues Glu290 [21, 22, 28] , other extra-domain regions are also critical for enzyme dimerization: namely the region around Asn214, region over Glu288-Asp289-Glu290, and the region over Arg298-Gln299 on the C-terminal last helix. More strikingly, our study has revealed that the mutant Asn214Ala still retained 30% activity although it had a tendency similar to ND and LHD to form a monomer (according to our results to the monomer-dimer distribution study of ND and LHD mutants) [28] . This result implies that the relationship between dimerization and activity might be very complex and needs to be carefully addressed in the future. If the residues critical for dimerization were mapped back to the dimeric structure of the SARS 3CLp, a very interesting picture is observed. As seen in Fig. 6A , the dimerization regions are clustered together to form a tertiary packing core in the middle of the dimeric enzyme. In fact in the core region, only two direct intermonomer contacts exist, namely between Glu290 of one protomer and Arg4 of another. Indeed, the importance of the Arg4-Glu290 interaction in dimerization has been reported previously [22] . The role of the identified residues other than Arg4 and Glu290 in dimerization might be in maintaining the correct sidechain conformations of the residues Glu290 and Arg4 by interacting with them. Indeed, within the same protomer, Asn214 has close contacts with Phe3 and Gln299 while Glu288 closely contacts to Lys5. Alternatively, some newly identified residues might contribute to dimerization by interacting with other nonextradomain residues which are not explored in the present study. It is also of note that although the dimerization interface appears relatively large, a single-mutation in particular on Asn214, Glu288, Asp289, Arg298 or Gln299 is sufficient to significantly disrupt enzyme dimerization.",

Based on this observation, a super-active mutant with a 3.7fold enhancement of proteolytic activity was engineered by mutating three residues Ser284-Thr285-Ile286 to Ala. As judged from the DLS results and NMR HSQC spectra, the triple-mutant has structural and dimerization properties similar to those of the wildtype protease. This observation strongly implies that in addition to dimerization, the extra domain might have other mechanisms for regulating the catalytic machinery. It would be of significant interest in the future to introduce the mutations into viral infectious clones to test whether these mutations will increase the viral fitness or viral replication capacity.",

            "text": "As seen in Fig. 6A , the two extra-domain enhancing regions are far away from the active sites of both protomers. This raises a very interesting question as to how these regions can achieve regulation of the catalytic machinery which is far away. Possibly, the slight but long-range alterations of structure and dynamics of the enzyme, as well as enzyme-solvent interactions upon mutation could account for the observed regulatory effects. As seen in Fig. 6A and B the majority of the dimerization residues plus Phe291, Ser284-Thr285-Ile286 are clustered together to form a molecular channel passing through the middle region of the enzyme. Owing to its molecular-scale size, we thus call it a nano-channel which has a diameter of 12 \u00c5 and a surface area of 360 \u00c5 2 , with the up-wall length of 18 \u00c5 and bottom-wall length of 7 \u00c5 . The upper wall of the channel appears to have connectivity to the inner cavities while the two ends of the channel are also further connected to the surface cavities of the enzyme molecule which eventually lead to the activesite pockets. Interestingly Ala mutations of the residues Ser284-Thr285-Ile286 which significantly enhanced catalytic activity would remove the bottom wall of the channel. Based on this, we thus speculate that this channel might serve as a regulator sitting in the central region of the enzyme, and play a role in relaying the regulatory effect from the extra domain to the catalytic machinery. Certainly, the future determination of the high-resolution structures of the mutant proteases such as ND, Arg298Ala, Asn214 and superactive mutant STI \u2044 A may shed light on the molecular mechanism as to why dimerization is critical for the activity of the wild-type protease as well as to why Ala mutations of Ser284, Thr285 and Ile286 can dramatically enhance the catalytic activity.",

Thus, we selected one deposited crystallographic structure of the SARS 3CLp (PDB code: 1Q2W) as a template, and subsequently added hydrogen atoms to the structure using graphic software yasara (http://www. yasara.org). A TCL \u2044 TK script was prepared to calculate the distances between the residues of the extra-domain and those on another protomer. Consequently a total of 15 residues were listed out including Asn214, Thr280, Leu282, Gly283, S284, Thr285, Ile286, Glu288, Asp289, Glu290, Phe291, Arg298, Gln299, Cys300 and Ser301. Since a closer examination of the 3D structures including 1Q2W and other [21] revealed that both N-and C-termini had a large number of contacts with the 15 selected residues, we generated three N-and C-terminal deletion constructs, namely ND(D1-5) with N-terminal residues 1-5 deleted; LHD(D293-306) with the last helix (residues 293-306) deleted; CD(D278-306) with the C-terminal residues 278-306 deleted. Moreover, the examination also indicated extensive contacts between the loop regions (residues 276-290) on the two protomers, we also made two loop-replacement constructs, with the loop residues 276-290 replaced by two Gly residues for LR(276-290 \u2044 2G) and by four Gly residues for LR(276-290 \u2044 4G).",
