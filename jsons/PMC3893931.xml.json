Histological assessments of the placenta, placental cultures, and fetal autopsies could miss important infections. Additionally, even with evidence of infection, the precise reasons for specific stillbirths are often difficult to establish. Neither positive serological tests nor organisms in the placenta or fetus prove causality.4, 5, 6, 7, 10 Furthermore, infection can initiate a chain of events leading to stillbirth, and its contribution to fetal death might not be appreciated (eg, rubella infections cause congenital anomalies). Which stillbirths are attributed to infection depends partly on the extent of the investigation and the classification system used.11\n",

In high-income countries, such tests are generally available but are not done routinely. Since confirmation of the infectious aetiology of stillbirth requires use of these techniques at a minimum, we believe that the contribution of infections to stillbirth is substantially underdiagnosed in settings of low, middle, and high income. Furthermore, if routine bacterial and viral cultures were supplanted by advanced molecular techniques, the apparent contribution of infection to stillbirth would probably rise still further. For example, in this Review we will discuss the coxsackie virus as a cause of unexplained stillbirths.12\n",

More than 1 million cases of congenital syphilis occur worldwide every year.26, 27 The most common cause of fetal death seems to be placental infection with decreasing blood flow to the fetus, although direct fetal infection also has a role.28 Most studies report syphilis to have a relative risk of stillbirth of 2\u20135; however, in a Tanzanian study, the relative risk was 18 for women with active syphilis.29 In some areas of sub-Saharan Africa, 25\u201350% of all stillbirths are associated with syphilis.24 Syphilis also contributes to stillbirths in other areas of the world including Russia, Asia, and South America.30, 31, 32\n",

Within a functioning health system, screening of pregnant women for syphilis is feasible, and once disease is diagnosed, treatment is easy and inexpensive. Women who have been treated for syphilis have a similar or slightly greater stillbirth risk than do women who are not infected.33, 34 The reasons for the present failure to eliminate congenital syphilis, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, include poor access to prenatal care or use of such services, and failure to provide appropriate treatment for syphilis because of lack of resources, poorly functioning supply systems, and other priorities such as HIV screening and treatment. Consequently, point-of-care rapid testing and treatment could be the most cost-effective method to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with syphilis.35 Schmid and colleagues26, 27 converted the fetal or neonatal consequences of maternal syphilis into disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). They suggested that when stillbirth was included, the cost to save 1 DALY was about US$10 and was 25 times less expensive than that for infants born to women infected with HIV.26, 27 Based on these and other data, WHO has launched a programme to eliminate congenital syphilis worldwide.36\n",

Lyme disease, a systemic illness caused by the tick-borne Borrelia burgdorferi, was first associated with stillbirth in 1987.37 Small series of stillbirths associated with maternal Lyme disease have been reported, with most fetal deaths occurring in the midtrimester. Spirochaetes have been found in fetal liver, spleen, kidney, and brain. However, large-scale serological studies have shown that few stillbirths are associated with Lyme disease except in highly endemic areas.38 In Tanzania, more than 30% of adults are seropositive for B burgdorferi\n39 compared with 2% in the USA and Norway, but whether Lyme disease is an important cause of stillbirths in African settings is unknown. Another spirochaetal disease associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, is tick-borne relapsing fever, caused by Borrelia duttonii. Findings from one study showed perinatal mortality of 30%.40 In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 6\u00b74% of pregnant women admitted to a maternity ward had relapsing fever.41 As with Lyme disease, in most African settings the prevalence of tick-borne relapsing fever and its contribution to stillbirths is unknown.42, 43\n",

The organisms can be transmitted to the fetus, and occurrence of stillbirth is attributed to both placental dysfunction and fetal infection. Transplacental infections have also been reported in association with maternal tularaemia, clostridia, anthrax, typhoid fever, brucellosis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, the plant bacterium Agrobacterium radiobacter, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.6 Additionally, maternal cachexia associated with late diagnosis of tuberculosis and advanced disease seems to be a risk factor for stillbirth.45 Although tuberculosis is generally rare in pregnancy, occurrence is increasing in many locations, especially in sub-Saharan African countries where HIV is prevalent. Whether co-infection increases the risk of stillbirth compared with the risk from HIV alone is unclear.46\n",

Consequently, a common autopsy finding in stillbirths is pneumonitis. Whether the fetus is stillborn with pneumonitis or is born alive with pneumonia depends on factors such as organism virulence, the fetal response, and time between infection and delivery. Blackwell48 and Romero49 and their colleagues postulated that a preterm infection usually elicits a fetal inflammatory response and ultimately preterm labour, but if the fetus cannot initiate an adequate inflammatory response, the outcome will probably be stillbirth. Stillbirths before 28 weeks seem to be strongly associated with intrauterine bacterial infection, whereas later preterm stillbirths are less likely to be caused by such infection.5, 10 Therefore, the apparent prevalence of this condition will depend on whether calculations include stillbirths occurring from 20 weeks onwards, or only those occurring at a later gestational age.",

Instead, the stillbirth risk is probably due to maternal comorbidities and overall poor maternal health status, especially in countries of low and middle income. However, since the prevalence of maternal HIV-1 infection reaches more than 20% in sub-Saharan countries, the contribution of maternal HIV-1 infection to stillbirths is probably important in such areas. Concerns that combination antiretroviral treatment might contribute to an increase in stillbirth in women with HIV-1 infection have not been realised.63\n",

Subsequently, other abnormalities such as major cardiac defects have been recorded, some of which result in stillbirth later in pregnancy. Rubella also infects the placenta, increasing the risk of stillbirth, and can seemingly do so without fetal spread.17 Rubella outbreaks are routinely reported from many low-income and middle-income countries; however, their contribution to stillbirths in such areas is unknown.68 Maternal infections with mumps and rubeola (measles) have both been implicated as causes of stillbirth,66 and both viruses have been isolated from fetal tissues. In Guinea-Bissau, occurrence of stillbirth increased by four to nine times if the mother was infected with measles during her pregnancy.69 Varicella (chickenpox) infections during pregnancy can cause maternal pneumonia, placing infected women at risk for death as well as stillbirth.

Parvovirus can cross the placenta and preferentially attacks erythropoietic tissue, causing severe fetal anaemia, non-immune hydrops, and fetal death.76, 77 Parvovirus can also cause stillbirth by directly attacking fetal cardiac tissue, resulting in cardiac damage without associated hydrops. Previous parvovirus infection elicits an antibody response that protects against subsequent maternal and fetal infection. However, even with a new maternal parvovirus infection, the risk of stillbirth is small.78, 79 In the USA, less than 1% of all stillbirths result from parvovirus infection.80 However, findings of a study in Sweden that used PCR for viral DNA to confirm parvovirus infection, showed that 15% of all stillbirths were attributed to parvovirus.77 In another Swedish study, 8% of stillbirths were caused by parvovirus, and similar rates have been reported in Germany.78, 79\n",

However, the overall effect of such viruses on stillbirths is unknown, especially in countries of low and middle income. In a detailed investigation of unexplained perinatal deaths, Nuovo and colleagues12 identified coxsackie virus in 48% of cases. The authors emphasised that the histological findings in the placenta were often non-specific and underscored the need for molecular testing to define this relation. In a study from Sweden, of 21 women with stillborn babies, 52% were infected with coxsackie virus compared with only 22% of the control group.81 Echovirus and enteroviruses have also been cultured from stillborn babies. In most studies, unless the virus was specifically sought at autopsy with advanced molecular techniques, an infectious cause of stillbirth would have been missed. Similarly, cytomegalovirus has rarely been sought in cases of stillbirth.82, 83 Findings from an Australian study showed that 9% of blood samples taken from stillbirths by cardiac puncture and analysed by PCR were positive for cytomegalovirus.84 Furthermore, Syridou and colleagues85 showed significantly increased concentration of cytomegalovirus from PCR in the placentas of stillbirths (16%) compared with controls (3%; p=0\u00b7047). Since cytomegalovirus is the most common cause of congenital infection, and because it can infect the fetus, leading to fetal-growth restriction and CNS damage, the relation between cytomegalovirus and stillbirth warrants further research. Hepatitis and herpes simplex infections have also been described as a cause of fetal death.86\n",

Antibiotic treatment for women with syphilis seems to effectively reduce the stillbirth risk to almost that of women without infection.32 Reduction of maternal malaria infections in endemic areas should also reduce the stillbirth rate. Antimalarial strategies that have been assessed specifically for implementation during pregnancy95, 96 include malaria prophylaxis, especially intermittent therapy, and use of insecticide-treated bednets. Although these strategies clearly reduce malaria and outcomes such as severe anaemia, most studies have not been powered to show improvements in rare outcomes such as stillbirth.",

Further, potential causes of stillbirth such as worm infestations have rarely been considered.103 We believe that research in several settings in countries of low and middle income, using both traditional and the newest molecular and culture techniques, should be done to ascertain the full extent of the relation between stillbirths and infection. Only with this research can we hope to define the reasons for the excessive stillbirth burden in such countries and develop effective reduction strategies.108\n",
