As disasters are considered to cause harm and damage to humans and their properties, there are always some human or technical preventive actions possible. Therefore, even disasters that are commonly accepted as natural disasters include, to a certain extent, some social or technical failures. Figure 2-1 shows that people consider there to be a human component for virtually all types of disasters. What is interesting, however, is the fact that people also consider social disasters, for example insurrection, to be not entirely human-made, but including some natural components as well.",

(Karger 1996) Already the Natech risks -a technical disaster caused by a natural disaster, show the interaction and overlap between different categories of risk. Furthermore, risks to humans can be classified according to the exposure paths: inhalation risks, ingestion risks, contamination risks, violence risks and temperature risks, including fire. Another way of classifying risks is shown in Fig. 2 -2, which classifies disasters and risks not only according to natural and man-made influence but also according to the voluntariness and intensity of the disaster.

Natural hazards contribute substantially to the threat to humans.

The development of the frequency of natural risks is shown in Fig. 2-3 . The overall cost in the past decade attributed to these natural disasters exceeds 50 billion dollars. Of course, one has to keep in mind that over this time period the population and the number of goods on earth has increased substantially, and finally the quality of recording data has improved as well.",

The stars visible to the naked eye mainly belong to the Milky Way galaxy, which contains up to 200 billion stars (Lanius 1988 , NGS 1999 . With a little bit of luck, one can see the Andromeda galaxy that is two million light years away. In general, if one observes the astronomical systems, worlds with other time scales become visible. By extending the power of the human eye through sophisticated telescopes, objects at greatest distance from earth, which are essentially the physical borders of our space, may become visible. Such objects reach distances of up to 13 billion light years from the earth. Actually, one has seen only some historical objects, since when dealing with such distances, the speed of light becomes important. Within this distance of 13 billion light years, mankind, so far, has found approximately 100 billion galaxies (NGS 1999) . Considering such a huge number of objects, there might, of course, be objects that pose a hazard to humans. The question is, are we sufficiently far enough to be not at risk. If events like supernovas happen in the neighbourhood of the solar system, this might result in the extinction of mankind. Evidence has also been found of huge collisions between galaxies (NASA 2003) . It seems, however, that such events have happened at a sufficiently large distance from the earth. As already mentioned, Andromeda is at a distance of about two million light years from earth. The closest galaxies to the earth, the irregular Magellanic cloud, are still a 150,000 light years away. Therefore, in the case of risk assessment, one can mainly focus on our galaxy and the stars in the neighbourhood of our sun.",

This value corresponds very well to the age of stones from the moon or from meteorite stones. It has been estimated that the fuel of the sun, hydrogen, will exhaust in about five billion years ( Fig. 2-6) . Then, the core of the sun will consist of helium, and a fusion of helium, to carbon will occur. The sun will evolve through fusions from hydrogen to helium, then to carbon, neon, oxygen, silicon and at the end iron. The probable death of the sun will be a supernova, leaving a neutron star. Examples of supernovas can be found in historical documents. Japanese and Chinese sources around the year 1054 describe the sudden flash of a star from Taurus (Lanius 1988) . Pictures taken in that region today show a cloud. This fact supports the supernova theory. Such a huge energy release in the neighbourhood of our solar system would probably destroy all types of life in the system.",

It will be 100 times as big as its current size. The drop in surface temperature from 5,800\u00b0C to 4,000\u00b0C will probably not help much. Considering such conditions as a disaster, one has to investigate how precise are our models about the development of stars. Fortunately, for such models, not only theoretical considerations but also observations can be used. Very old structures in the universe, especially, can give hints about the possible development of stars. In some globular clusters, different age clusters of stars were observable. In general, however, the rule of thumb is valid -that the stars of a region have the same age. Therefore, the chance of risk of a sudden explosion of stars in our neighbourhood or the explosion of our sun in a few decades or centuries should be extremely low. Fig. 2-6 . Development of the sun in a Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (Lanius 1988) Probably the earth will change extensively over the lifetime of the sun, because the earth is not a static, solidified mass. This becomes clear during events such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes. The earth itself belongs to a group of planets. A simple tabalation of the distance of the planets from the sun is the Titus Bode rule (Table 2-3) . Here, the distance is given as a factor of the Astronomical unit. The Astronomical unit represents eight light minutes or about 150 million kilometers (Gellert et al. 1983 ). The observed distances show rather high values, and therefore collisions or other negative impacts from these planets seem currently neglectable, although Pluto crosses the orbit of Neptune. Here, the latest developments, for example excluding Pluto from the group of planets, are not considered. (Gellert et al. 1983) Planet N a n a 38.8 39.5 Titius-Bode rule: a n = 0.4 + 0.3 \u00d7 2 n ; where a n is planet-sun distance in Astronomical units and a is observed planet-sun distance.",

Twenty percent of meteors are particles from comets. Some meteor showers occur regularly at certain times of the year; examples are listed in Table 2 -4. (Langenhorst 2002) The October-Draconids is a good example of a regular meteor shower. The shower dates back to the Giacobini-Zinner comet, which appeared for the first time on 9 October 1926. The following years of 1933 and 1946 were extremely rich in meteor showers. On 9 October 1933, an average of 14,000 falling stars were detected. Falling stars are meteorids that break up at nearly 70-120 km before reaching earth. The contribution of falling stars to the meteorite volume that reaches earth is only about 0.05%.",

Additionally, small craters are much more difficult to identify than bigger ones.

A hit by a body with a diameter of several kilometers would presumably kill all life on that side of the planet. The explosion wave of temperature over 500\u00b0C and a speed of 2,000-2,500 km/h would move around the world (NN 2003) . If the ocean would be hit, there would be Tsunamis with a height of several kilometers. Additionally, the impact would yield to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Since the impact would bring huge masses of dust into the atmosphere, the temperature would drop rapidly. This is observed to a lesser degree for some volcanic eruptions. In general, under such situations, there is a possibility that mankind would become extinct. Quite some studies have investigated such conditions mainly based on the assumption that such conditions could exist as an aftermath of a World War (Chapmann et al. 2001) . Gellert et al.

            "text": "Meteorite impacts might be one possible cause for the so-called mass extinctions during prehistoric times. An example of this was the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary extinction event, probably caused by the impact of the Chicxulub Asteroid in the area of Mexico. As a consequence of this impact, about 17% of all biological families, including the dinosaurs, became 10 km 50-100,000,000 years 10 8 megaton TNT Chicxulub, Mexico 1 km 1,000,000 years 10 5 megaton TNT Mistastin Lake, Canada 100 m 10,000 years 10 2 megaton TNT Barringer Krater, USA 10 m 1,000 years 10 -1 megaton TNT Tunguska Meteorite, Russia 1 m 1 year 10 -2 megaton TNT 1 mm 30 s 10 -10 megaton TNT extinct. Whether the asteroid was the one and only cause of extinction is still debated. The idea of a major asteroid impact is found in some work by Alvarez in the 1970s. Alvarez investigated the quantity of Iridium in the maritime mud. In general, the results of the investigation, which used some material from Italy (Gubbio), showed the expected value of 0.3 ppb (parts per billion) Iridium. Some soil layers, however, showed dramatically higher values of Iridium in the order of 10 ppb. Afterwards, a material from Denmark (Stevn's Klint) was tested. Here, the Iridium values were even higher, reaching up to 65 ppb. This Iridium peak was found worldwide in layers representing the time of the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, which is now sometimes called the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Iridium itself is a noble earth element. It mainly comes from meteorites or partly from volcanic eruptions. This yields to the hypothesis that, probably during the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, a huge meteorite impacted the earth. Based on this consideration, the impact body should have had a size of about 10 km and hit the earth approximately 65 million years ago (Alvarez et al. 1980) . The next step in the validation of this theory would be the identification of a crater. Unfortunately, terrestrial processes like sedimentation, erosion or plate tectonics might cover or erase the typical surface expression of an impact event. An important witness of an impact, however, which is not so easily altered over time, is the affected rocks. Craters are filled with melted, shocked or brecciated rocks. Some parts of the rocks have been transported during the impact from the crater to the surroundings. This transported material is called ejecta. Most parts are found in the surroundings within a distance of less than five times the diameter of the crater (Montanari & Koeberl 2000 , Melosh 1989 . Therefore, it is thought that the increase in Iridium was due to abundant impact debris. The identification of the local crater was done using microtektites. These are small tektites, not more than 1 mm in diameter, generated during high pressures. Such high pressures might be shock waves caused by a meteorite impact.",

Some explain the increase in Iridium by heavy volcanic eruptions. About 65 million years ago, there was an extremely active volcanic region at the Deccan Traps. The amount of lava released could have covered half the area of modern India. Due to the possible huge releases of gases, there was an average temperature increase of up to 8\u00b0C around half million years before the meteorite impact. Iridium can also be found abundant, as mentioned before, in volcanic material (NGS 1998a,b) .",

            "text": "Paleontologists also refute the fact that the extinction of the entire classes of animals was based solely on one disastrous event. There seems to be some current discussion, however, on whether some species survived, for example some dinosaurs. There are indications that, for example, some hadrosaurids might have survived the event for some time. But, under such conditions, it might be that the animal class cannot recover (Jablonski 2002) . Additionally, it is not clear if the fossils might have been moved to later sediment. Although paleontologists do not like the idea of sudden extinction events, such phenomena have occurred several times in the history of the earth as shown in Table 2 -8. (Hoffmann 2000) . Figure 2-9 is a graphical visualisation of the diversity of marine families that have existed throughout time. The first interesting fact is the diversity of marine life at present. There have never been so many different families at one time. The data, however, have not yet considered the influence of humans, which is, of course, decreasing the diversity of marine life. The second interesting fact is the repeated occurrence of mass extinction events. Probably the most significant event was the Perm extinction. Some references state that, around 100,000 years back, 50% of all biological families and 90% of all marine families became extinct (Morell 1999 , Newson 2001 . Other references give lower percentages (NGS 1998a,b) . The oldest event was the Ordovician extinction. During this event, about 25% of all biologic families disappeared (Morell 1999). Other references, however, mention that up to 75% of all animal families became extinct (NGS 1998a,b) . During the Devonian event, the number of extinctions was about the same. Fig. 2-9 . Number of marine families over time (NGS 1998a,b) The current number of species has been estimated at about 1.5 million. However, since the human population has shown a rapid growth over time, many species have became endangered. In 1980, the overall biomass was Many examples can be given for the extinction of species. For example, the wild pigeon, Extopistes Migratorius, was very common at the end of the 19th century in the eastern states of the US. According to different estimations, the overall number of this bird species must have been several billions. However, due to the good taste and the good preservability of the meat, the birds were hunted since about 1870. In 1879, in Michigan alone, more than one billion birds were captured. The last brooding nest was seen estimated to be about 2,000 \u00d7 10 6 tonnes. Assuming that the human biomass was about 2.5% of the overall biomass and farm stocks was approximately 325 \u00d7 10 6 tonnes, then about 1,625 \u00d7 10 6 tonnes were left for the 1.5 million species. Furthermore, it should be assumed that the amount of biomass remains constant, and mankind and farm stock constantly grow between 1.7 and 2.1%; then in the year 2020, only about 1,370 \u00d7 10 6 tonnes will be left for all other species. One can easily imagine that this will yield to a decrease in the number of species. Furthermore, since the decrease is at very fast pace, it could be considered a mass extinction (F\u00fcller 1980) . in 1894, the last wild pigeon was seen in 1907, and in 1914 the last pigeon captured died. Nowadays, only a few primed specimens remain, for example in Jena, Germany (F\u00fcller 1980) . A further example was the Quagga. This was a type of zebra living in southern Africa. Because the Boers thought it was a competitor for their own farm stocks, Quaggas were killed. In 1870, only three Quaggas were left in zoos, and in 1883, the last one died (B\u00fcrger et al. 1980) . Further examples of exctinct species are listed in NGS (1998a,b) and Sedlag (1978).",

The crust permanently moves, mainly driven by the circulation of viscous and liquid materials in the layers beneath. If the crust opens or ruptures, the fluid, hot rock and also gases and ash might escape, creating volcanism. The maximum depth of the volcanic material is the border of the outer core and the lower mantle, which is between 2,500 and 3,000 km deep. Volcanism is a geologic, earth surface-forming process. The number of volcanos is estimated at several thousands; however, only a few hundreds are active (Fig. 2-10 and Table  2 The intensity of volcanic features can be described by different measures. The volcanic explosivity index (VEI) has been introduced by Newhall & Self (1982) . It is a measure comparable to the Richter scale, which is used to measure the intensity of earthquakes. The VEI is based on the volcanic volume released and the height of the smoke pillar (Table 2-10) . Critic against the VEI is, for example, mentioned in Smolka (2007) . Another volcanic intensity measure is the Tsuya-index. Additionally, for many volcanic eruptions, the opacity is given, which is a measure that describes the influence of the volcanic eruption on global climate. (Newson 2001) . Only two citizens of the town St. Pierre survived the eruption, which included one prisoner. Lacroix investigated the Mont Pel\u00e8 eruption and published a famous work about volcanic explosions. However, already in the 18th century, researchers like Hutton started to develop theories about the changing and evolving earth (Daniels 1982) . In 1815, the Tambora eruption in Sumbawa, Indonesia, claimed about 10,000 lives. Afterwards, an additional 82,000 fatalities occurred in the region due to famine and disease. Furthermore, the weather worldwide was affected, and in the summer of 1816 the coldest temperatures ever were recorded. In combination with the Napoleon wars, the harvest loss was a heavy burden on the European population. In the New England states in North America, freezing temperatures were observed in summer this year. The Krakatoa eruption yielded to an average worldwide temperature drop of about 0.3\u00b0C. On average, volcanic eruptions can affect climate by the same magnitude as anthropogenic effects.",

The lithosphere -a layer of solid earth is broken into several plates ( Fig. 2-11 ). The internal thermal engine of the earth drives the motion of the plates (Sornette 2006) . The borders of the plates are not sharp boundaries, but instead they are complex systems, sometimes reaching several hundred kilometers long. Therefore, the estimated number of plates has changed over the last few decades, since microplates have been found in boundary areas. While previously only 14 plates were known, newer works suggest that 42-52 plates exist. The plate size follows a \"power the \"Vesuvius\" volcano in Italy erupted in the years 79 (perish of Pompeii), law\". The limitation of the earth surfaces limits the size of the plates. Furthermore the size of the convection cells in the upper mantle also influences the size of the plates. (Sornette 2006) .",

Therefore, the well-known Gutenberg-Richter law (Gutenberg & Richter 1954) for earthquake seismic moment releases was modified for large earthquakes (Hosser et al. 1991) . It is thus concluded that the maximum earthquake energy realised can be found, if external events like meteorite, impact are not considered. The two strongest earthquakes in the 20th century (Chile 22 May 1960, 1.1 \u00d7 10 26 erg energy released, and Alaska, 28 March 1964, 4 \u00d7 10 25 erg energy released) nearly reached that maximum value. It is quite interesting to note that the average yearly seismic energy of all other earthquakes is about 3 \u00d7 10 24 erg. The recurrence time of a typical maximum earthquake is less than 100 years (Sornette 2006) . Table 2 -11 lists the magnitudes of some earthquakes in the previous century. The magnitude is related to the energy released, Based on our understanding of the mechanism of earthquakes, it becomes clear that earthquakes are connected to some regions: the borders of the tectonic plates. In these regions, about 3 billion humans live (DKKV 2002) . Tables 2-12 and 2-13 show a list of deadliest earthquakes. In some areas, earthquake activities can be dated back over thousands of years. The city of Antioch in Turkey was hit by severe earthquakes in the years 115, 458, 526, 588, 1097, 1169 and 1872 .

            "text": "In general, geological changes do not only threaten on a short-term scale, like earthquakes, but also over the long-term as they may affect climate and create changes to the weather. It is now very well known that the climate on earth has changed permanently. For example, 65 million years ago, the average climate on earth was much warmer than today, and within 55 million years, a maximum average temperature value was reached. Figure 2-12 shows the development of average earth surface temperature with a logarithmic time scale over 65 million years. At the peak value, the polar ice was completely molten and tropical forests reached up to the Arctic region (NGS 1998a,b) . The ancestors of crocodiles lived up to Greenland, and the ground temperature of the oceans, which is now about 4\u00b0C, reached 17\u00b0C. The temperature gradient between equator and polar regions was nearly neglectable. Of course, geographic land distribution has heavily influenced such climatic conditions. Approximately 60 million years ago, Australia and Antarctica got separated. This created a new ocean, which cooled Antarctica. At the same time, Africa bounded into Europe and India bounded into Asia. In these regions, new mountains were created, which changed the climate conditions, for example lowering the average sealevel and increasing the size of land. Since land has lower heat-storage capabilities, this could therefore have contributed to a drop in temperature. Additionally, it is assumed that the formation of coal and oil might have deprived the atmosphere of global warming gases. Therefore, from about 55 to 35 million years ago, earth climate experienced a cooling phase yielding polar ice caps. Following this, a warming phase occurred in the next 14 million years, and then a cooling phase started again a few thousand years ago. The polar ice caps reached three times a size than nowadays. Based on the measurement of tree rings, coral reefs, ice drillings or other sources of historical information, one can well estimate the climate changes on earth over the last 20,000 years (Wilson et al. 1999) . Compared to such climatic changes, the fluctuations are rather low. However, fluctuations do occur, as one may make out from the size of glaciers, for example. Figures 2-13 and 2-14 show the Aletsch glacier in Switzerland. This glacier has lost about 100 m of its in height at the Konkordia place over the last 100 years. Moreover, the overall ice volume on earth has decreased by about 10% since 1960.",

(NZZ 2004a,b For the winter, an increase of the average temperatures in Europe has been identified. The period from 1973 to 2002 has been considered the warmest over the last 500 years. The increase of the winter temperatures is especially interesting for risk considerations, since the loss of temperature yields to less snow and less long-term high-pressure areas in Central Europe. These high-pressure areas originally anticipated the movement of stormy low-pressure regions from the Atlantic to Central Europe. Besides, the coldest winter in Europe, based on some measurement occurred in 1708/1709.",

Nevertheless, the proof that a systematic climate change is currently under way is difficult to obtain. The climate system of the earth is extremely complex and related to many other systems, such as social systems, astronomical systems, maritime systems and so on. Mankind is currently influencing the climate system by the massive burning of fossil fuels. If the trend continues as shown in Fig. 2-16 (left), then temperature increase will not only directly influence living conditions and agriculture, but also that the sea level will rise. The consequences of a sea level rise of about 0.5 m is shown in Table 2 -15. About 1/5th of the world's population lives within a distance of 30 km from the sea, and the majority of Mega cities are coastal cities or are located closest to the sea (Geipel 2001) . Climate change might not only cause flood risks or storm risks; it might also yield to additional gravitational risks. For example, when the temperature of permafrost ground increases, it might lose strength yielding to failure. Historical data of mass movement events in the Alps show a peak at the end of the 19th century, which is related to the end of the small ice age (Totschnig & H\u00fcbl 2008) . The failures of permafrost might also cause glacier lake dam failure yielding to floods (K\u00e4\u00e4b et al. 2006 ).",

For example in Brazil, it has been estimated that about 1/4th of the population is unable to obtain a sufficient amount of food (NZZ 2004) . In Ghana, for example, 1/3rd of the population is considered malnourished (Jelenik 2004 The nutritional conditions are identified based on different anthropometrical parameters adjusted to the type of undernourishment. Acute undernourishment, also called wasting, is mainly identified by a ratio of weight to height measurements. Here, values less than 70% or an age-dependent diameter of the upper arm indicate undernourishment. To determine chronic undernourishment, a ratio of height to age is mainly used. Again, diameter of the arm can be used for identification. Last but not least, pathogenic signs such as edemas or starvation dystrophy can be used to identify undernourishment. Such edemas occur on the arms, legs and in the face. The skin becomes fragile and hairs can be pulled out without pain. With a heavy loss of fatty tissue and muscular tissue, the ribs, spine and scapula become visible. Generally, severely malnourished children get the expression of old people. Another epidemiological measure for undernourishment is the amount of energy provided. In general, an energy amount between 2,000 and 2,600 kcal is required per capita per day.",

Therefore, economic reactions to harvest failures heavily influence the development of famines. This fact becomes visible now with better means of transportation. With the increase in shipping especially around the end of the medieval times, the number of famines dropped since ships were used excessively to bring food, which positively acted in the market, at least in coastal regions.",

Figure  2 -24 shows the spectral density of wind speed indicating some micrometereological and macrometereological conditions. Depending on the type of storm, different storm intensity measures have been introduced. The Fujita scale describes tornado intensity by wind speeds and damages (Table 2-17). Another intensity measure is the Saffir-Simpson scale, which was developed in the 1970s (Table 2-18 ). This scale is used to measure hurricane intensity based on wind speeds and atmospheric pressure. Further measures are also known or under development, for example the Torro scale, the Hurrican Intensity Index or the Australian-Tropical-Cyclone-Severity Scala (Munich Re 2006b). The Beaufort scale is widely used for winds that are less intense than hurricanes (Table  2- 19) , and is the oldest intensity measure originating around the beginning of the 19th century. Webster et al. (2005) have described the possible changes in storm intensity in a warmer climate. Already the effects of winterstorms in Europe have been discussed in Sect. 2.3.4.1 (Lieberwirth 2003 , Munich Re 2006a . Even under the current climatic conditions, storms represent a major hazard. In 1970, a storm in Bangladesh together with a water storm surge killed about 300,000 people. This was probably one of the biggest natural disasters in the 20th century (O'Neill 1998) . In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch reached Central America and killed 5,700 people in Honduras alone. More than 600,000 people were affected by the hurricane. The damages reached up to 80% of the gross domestic product. In Peru, about 300 bridges were heavily damaged (Williams 1999) . Another severe storm reached southern Africa in the year 2000. In February and March, the cyclone Eline crossed Mozambique, South Africa, Botswana, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia, causing more than 1,000 fatalities and more than 660 million US dollars lon of property (Munich Re 2001) . In 1992, Hurricane Andrew in the US caused a financial damage of 15 billion US dollars. Also, the winterstorms in Europe in 1990 costed about 15 billion US dollars (Mechler 2003) .",

In fact, so called \"time clusters\" could be found. There exist several theories to describe such effects, for example climate cycles or the fatigue of the water storage capability of a landscape after a flood. Therefore, the next flood can occur even with a lower water supply. An example of a cluster could be shown for the French rivers Ter, Segre and Llobregat. There are data available since the year 1300. Peaks of floods were observed between 1582 and 1632, with maximum values in 1592 and 1606.

Historical data for the river Elbe are shown in Table 2 The floods mentioned so far were storm surges, sea floods caused by storm and tides, or river floods caused by the heavy release of water either through snow or ice melting or heavy rain. Both types cause the so-called \"surface waves\". Another type of sea surface waves is \"freak waves\". They are explained by spatial and temporal interference, and are defined as being at least three times the size of an average storm wave (Rosenthal 2004) .",

The classification of rock falls is shown in Table 2 -24 (Poisel 1997 , Abele 1974 . (Varnes 1978) There are many causes for rock falls, including postglacial load removal, mechanical stress changes caused by disturbances, stress changes caused by sliding, temperature changes, earthquakes, hydrostatic or hydrodynamic pressures, load by trees, ice loads or anthropogenic changes. If the rock elements have started to move, there are different kinds of movements. Usually the rock fall starts with sliding, free-fall, bouncing and rolling. The difference between bouncing and rolling is that bouncing constitutes one full rotation of a stone block without ground contact. The first ground contact after free fall is very important, because during that contact up to 85 % of the kinetic energy can be assimilated by the ground. Of course, this depends very much on the type of ground, for example rock or scree.",

The front of a debris flow can reach velocities up to 30 m/s (e.g. Costa 1984 , Rickenmann 1999 , and peak discharges can be tens of times greater than for floods occurring in the same catchment (e.g. Pierson 1986 , Hungr et al. 2001 ).

Depending on the relative concentration of fine and coarse sediments, the prefix \"viscous\" or \"granular\" is often used. Since the early 1970s, research increasingly focussed on the topic of debris flow behaviour (Johnson 1970 , Costa 1984 . Mud flows and debris flows consisting of a considerable amount of fine sediments are often regarded as homogeneous fluids, where the bulk flow behaviour is controlled by the \"rheologic\" properties of the material mixture (e.g. Julien & O'Brien 1997 , Coussot et al. 1998 , Cui et al. 2005 . For debris flows mainly consisting of coarse particles and water, this simple rheological approach has limitations. In the last decades, geotechnical models have been employed to describe the motion of (granular) debris flows (e.g. Savage & Hutter 1989 , Iverson 1997 , Iversion & Denlinger 2001 . (Pierson 1986) The behaviour of debris flows can be very variable, strongly depending on sediment composition and water content. Moreover, debris flow volume and bulk flow behaviour may change during travelling through a channel, for example by the entrainment of loose sediment and/or incorporation of water from a tributary. For this reason until now, no general applicable model used in praxis was able to cover the range of all possible material mixtures and event scenarios. There were some rules of thumb developed to estimate return periods as well as intensities, including volumes and duration . Table 2-25 shows some examples of extreme volumes. Due to their high density and fast movement, debris flows can jeopardize humans and residential areas. Table 2 -26 mentions some calamities caused by debris flows. ",

Landslides of slopes and hillsides are mass movements by sliding or flowing under wet conditions. The soil is usually fine-grained and is able to absorb water. The mass moves or flows on a slide face. Very often the process changes over time. For example, a mass movement might start as a landslide, but then trigger a debris flow. A torrent might initiate a debris flow. There were many different attempts to define landslides or debris flows (Table 2-27) . However, as explained in the first chapter, it seems to be questionable to reach an ultimate state of such definitions (DIN 19663, DKKV 2002 , Crozier 1998 , Cruden & Varnes 1996 . (Cruden & Varnes 1996 , Bell 2007 Another landslide in combination with debris flow and volcanic eruption occurred at the Columbian volcano Nevado del Ruiz Armero on 13th November 1985. The event killed about 30,000 people (Newson 2001) . However, several smaller tragedies have been caused by landslides as well. For example in Sweden, many smaller landslides have happened in the last centuries (Table 2-28). In Table 2 -28, an event on 1st October 1918 is mentioned, which shows only a small volume of moved area (0.2 ha), but the number of victims is rather high. In this case, a train crashed into the moving slope and started to burn (Al\u00e9n et al. 1999 , Fr\u00e9den 1994 , SGU 2004 . (Al\u00e9n et al. 1999 , Fr\u00e9den 1994 , SGU 2004 Year Location",

Flowing avalanches are sliding or flowing, whereas in powder avalanches, the material is suspended (flying). Usually a flowing avalanche starts by breaking and releasing snow slabs. These snow slabs accelerate by sliding. When the slabs break into pieces through tumbling and bounding, the movement of snow becomes a flow. The density of flowing avalanches is comparable with the density of normal snow (Table 2 -29). The flowing avalanches might slide either on the ground itself or on another layer of snow. These are called ground avalanches or upper (top) avalanches. Additionally, ground avalanches might consist of non-snow materials. In contrast, powder avalanches have a density much lower than snow. However, they either develop from a flowing avalanche or, in most cases, are combined with flowing avalanches. Pure powder avalanches exist only if, through certain conditions, the powder avalanche part separates from the flowing avalanche part. The speed of a powder avalanche reaches up to 90 m/s, whereas flowing avalanches might Landslides occur in many countries. For example, landslides killed 73 people in Australia from 1842 to 1997 (QG 2004) . In the USA, landslides cause an average yearly damage between 1.2 to 1.5 billion US dollars (1985) (Fern\u00e1ndez-Steeger 2002) . Damages and numbers of fatalities for Hong Kong are given by Shiu & Cheung (2003) . In recent years, severe accidents have happened, for example, in Philippines due to landslides, killing up to 200 people. reach a velocity of up to 40 m/s. Worldwide about 10 \u00d7 10 5 avalanches fall per year (Egli 2005 , Mears 2006 , Pudasaini & Hutter 2007 . The impact of the avalanches depends not only on the type of the avalanche, but also of the size. The Canadian Avalanche Size Classification is one example to describe the size (McClung & Schaerer 1993) . Currently intensive research work is carried out to develop models for avalanche impact forces (Gauer et al. 2008 , Sovilla et al. 2008 ). For such investigations real size avalanche test sites are used, where impact forces are measured (Issler et al. 1998) .",

Even in countries like Turkey avalanches can cause high number of fatalities like in 1992 with more than 200 victims (Newson 2001) . However, the highest number of fatalities caused by avalanches happened in the wars. Fraser (1966 Fraser ( , 1978 has estimated that avalanches killed about 40,000-80,000 soldiers during the times of the World Wars as avalanches were used as weapons. Avalanches on 13 th December 1916 alone killed around 10,000 soldiers. As with other gravitational hazards, there are possiblities to employ mitigation measures against avalanches. Such mitigation measures might range from nets to dams. In addition, avalanche warning using infrasound or laserscanning is possible (Prokop 2007) . Currently, in most Alpine regions, avalanche reports are available to inform people entering mountains during snow times (EAS 2008) . However, if people are hit by an avalanche, the chance of survival depends very strongly on the time entombed, as shown in Fig. 2 -37.",

While economic considerations assume that an increased capacity of transport and motion means more wealth, other works such as Knoflacher (2001) suggest that more transport capabilities does not necessarily improve wealth. At a certain level of transport capacity, transport decreases wealth. In general, however, if one looks at the development of different means of transportation, such as road traffic, railway traffic, ship traffic, air traffic or space traffic, one finds a constant increase in transport volume. Figure 2 -39 illustrates this statement for Germany in terms of the domestic transport volume in billion-tonnekilometer within the last few decades. As seen in the figure, there is a strong competition between the different means of transportation. Very often the choice of transportation depends not only on the competitiveness but also on some general properties, such as distance. Figure 2 -40 shows the choices of mode of transport taken from a survey in 1999 in the German city of Heidelberg. Clearly, walking and biking are mainly chosen for short distances, whereas the individual car traffic is chosen for activities within a radius of about 10 km. Public transport reaches two peaks, one for very short distances -which is probably bus transport, and the second -most likely railway transport, for longer distances, say 50 km. It is interesting to note that, during the medieval ages, most humans and goods did not have a larger transport radius than about 100 km. Nowadays, however, more or less the entire surface of the earth is reachable by transport means. ",

Such a long time of existence, however, does not mean that ships have been a safe form of transport during the last centuries. As a rough measure, it has been estimated that about 250,000 ships were lost on the coast of Great Britain (Wilson 1998 ). In the year 1852 alone, 1,115 ships were lost on this coast, claiming about 900 lives. One January storm lasting over five days took 257 ships, and 486 seamen lost their lives. The yearly maximum of lost ships was reached 1864 with 1,741 ships and 516 fatalities. But, the history of lost ships goes back to the beginning of this technology. In 255 B.C., a Roman fleet was returning from a battle in Cartago. The fleet came into a storm and about 280 ships were lost with 100,000 men (Eastlake 1998 ). In addition, the fall of the Spanish Armada in 1588 with the sinking of 90 ships and the loss of 20,000 men could be mentioned; however, this was not only due to natural hazards (Wilson 1998) . A detailed description about the battle of the Spanish Armada can be found in Hintermeyer (1998) .",

By 1979 about 92 astronauts had been to space. Four astronauts were killed by accidents during travel, while some astronauts were killed on earth during tests in 1967. Here, probably the best known accident was the fire of an Apollo capsule on ground. However, severe rocket explosions have also caused high numbers of fatalities. In April 1967, the Russian astronaut Komarow was killed when the parachute did not open during return. In 1970, the astronauts of Apollo 13 luckily survived the mission. In June 1971, three Russian astronauts were killed by a pressure loss during re-entry. (Mielke 1980) Although the Space Shuttle concept was considered to improve the safety and to drop the probability of complete loss from 10 -1 to 10 -2 (Pat\u00e9-Cornell & Fischbeck 1994) , the explosion of the Challenger in 1986 and the loss of the Columbia in 2003 showed drawbacks in this Space Shuttle concept. Considering these two losses and approximaetly 130 missions, high. However, in terms of risk, space travel contains a rather high risk. This 2.4 Technical Risks 155 one obtains 2/130=0.015 fatality per mission. This might also be considered fatality if the number of passengers per mission would be equal and astronauts would not have a second mission. Considering the 450 people who have been to space so far and the nearly 20 fatalities, this yields to further improvement of safety in terms of probability of loss as shown in Table 2 -44.",

The amount of waste materials generated has reached alarming values. For example, in the US, the amount of wastes has grown from 0.5 million tonnes per year during the 1940s to about 300 million tonnes in 1993 (Garrick 2000) . In Germany, the overall amount of has fallen, even though the definition of hazardous waste has become wider. Hazardous waste is of particular interest, since it includes toxic materials. The development of the construction of high-safety dumps or highsafety barriers designed for hazardous waste was intensively discussed during the 1980s and 1990s in Germany (HMUE 1992) . This was due to the limited capacity for waste burning and disposal in Germany at the end 20/450= 0.04 fatality per mission. Future space missiles should feature a wastes produced has grown during the last decades too. While in 1983 about 30 million tonnes of debris was produced, in 1993 it reached 43 million tonnes (Merz 2001) . Fortunately, over the last decades, the amount of wastes per capita has remained constant and the amount of special debris of the 1980s. Since then, the regulations for opening new dumps have become even harder. Dump sites are obliged to obtain permission, which is now restricted for densely populated areas. Currently, it is assumed that about 1/3 of wastes can be burned or recycled. This is probably a fitting value for most developed countries. In addition, waste is also exported from many countries. These limitations of dump sites have yielded to increased efforts since the 1980s to reduce the overall amount of wastes. Waste at present, and into the future, is treated by separation, burning, gasification, hydration or biological treatment prior to dumping (Merz 2001) .",

Nowadays, many different systems for dumps are developed and offered by companies. Such high-safety dumps include, for example, multi-barrier systems, and also the aftercare has been put into regulations. Nowadays, dumps are not seen anymore as passive storage but as reactors, in which chemical and biological processes occur. The lifetime of dumps is usually between 30 and 100 years. However, even nowadays absolute safety of dumps cannot be reached. Acceptable values about the release of materials can be found in different regulations. Here, only the requirements for the application of concrete as a second barrier against water-endangering fluids should be mentioned. Water-endangering fluids are those that which are able to contaminate bodies of water and change their properties. If such fluids are released, damage and harm to the environment and humans is assumed. Usually the so-called second barrier experiences only very rare contact with the fluid, e.g. about 10 -4 per year. Based on some safety classes, acceptable failure risks in terms of volume released material per time are presented in Table 2 -45 (W\u00f6rner 1997 , Kiefer 1997 . (Germany), color pigments (Schweinefurter green) were produced. That yielded to an average arsenic concentration of 2,500 mg/kg in the soil and 9,300 mg/l in the groundwater. The concentration levels of copper reached 2,300 mg/kg in the soil. In F\u00fcrth, (Germany), a mirror production site was closed. The mercury concentration reached 20 \u00b5g/m 3 in the air, 3,000 mg/m 3 in the rubble and 4,000 mg/m 3 in the soil. The tar lake in Rochlitz, Thuringia, is well known. Here, nearly 20 million tonnes of brown coal smolder tar as well as nearly 10 million tonnes of oil were processed. Additionally, during World War II, the plant was bombed groundwater were heavily contaminated, yielding to so-called swimming oil lenses in the groundwater. Many technologies have been developed to clean such locations, for example HOT-PACK, MEC-TOOL, XTRAX, BEST, mobile oven, biological techniques and stabilization techniques. As a last example, the Wismut Company for the mining of uranium in East Germany is mentioned. The cleaning-up of radioactive waste at dump sites had cost several billion Euros (Paffrath 2002) .",

The failure released approximately 600 million cubic-meters of water, which traveled with a velocity of 50 km/h over the valleys and plains. According to Chinese sources, about 85,000 people died within 24 h of the failure. Another 145,000 people died in the days after due to famine and disease. If these data are correct, then the failure of these dams was one of the biggest disasters in the world -only exceeded by the storm surge in Bangladesh in 1970, the Tangshan earthquake in 1976 and the Tsunami disaster in 2004. It can be seen as the biggest technical disaster of all times (Lind & Hartford 1999) This disaster shows clearly the connection between technical and natural risks. The dam would probably not have failed under regular weather conditions. In addition, the relationship between primary and secondary disasters is visible. More people died as a result of the secondary disaster of insufficient food and disease. This is a clear sign of the collapse of the social system after the primary disaster. It is quite often described by the term vulnerability. If, during an earthquake, some bridges collapse, then the region might not be accessible by external help and is, therefore, extremely vulnerable. This has been intensively discussed. For example, in the region of Cologne in Germany, a vulnerability study has been carried out investigating the possible impacts of the collapsing of the Rhine bridges during either a flood or earthquake. In Japan, studies have considered failure of bridges after earthquakes. It does not, however, have to be only structural failures that increase the vulnerability of a region. For example, there might be a collapse of the telephone and electrical systems, and therefore no information about a disaster can be communicated. In this case, satellite observation could be used on identify sudden changes in regions.",

In this particular case, the dam itself did not fail, but the design of the overall dam system failed, because the possibility of the slide was not considered (Pohl 2004) . Even if dams completely meet their structurally intended goals, other types of risks are generated. In 1950, approximately 5,000 dams with a crown higher than 30 m existed. This number has grown to 45,000 by the year 2000. This has had major economical, ecological and social impacts. In order to build the dam on the Yangtze River in China, nearly two million people were evacuated. Currently, there is a discussion whether new massive dams can cause earthquakes (Klesius 2002) .",

            "text": "The failure of dams is a special case of the failure of structures. Usually the failure of structures is related to two causes: either extremely high loads, which are called accidental loads, such as impacts; or insufficient strength mainly related to human failures. Both can be found in developed and developing countries. Examples from Germany are the collapse shown in Fig. 2-56 or the collapses of the Halstenbeker sports hall close to Hamburg in 1997 and 1998. The structure received the nickname the buckling egg. Since two collapses happened during the construction phase, nobody was injured, but the structure was never completed. The failure was due to a rather complicated structure type, which was very vulnerable to small changes to the geometry. A second example of structural failure in Germany occured on 2 January 2006 in Bad Reichenall. Again a sports hall collapsed in the afternoon killing 15 people, most of them children. The structural failure led to an intensive debate about the safety of public buildings in Germany. It was assumed that snow overload caused the failure, since also in Poland a hall collapsed for that reason in the same winter. This discussion echoed in the beginning of the 1970s, when many light-weight structures in East and West Germany failed under snow load. Initially, sabotage was assumed to be the cause of failure in East Germany; however, very optimistic assumptions about snow load and the change of the construction material from wood to steel were later identified as the causes. It was determined that the cause of failure in Bad Reichenhall was a combination of lack of maintenance, law regarding the safety standards of public buildings by requiring additional inspections. structural changes over time and the application of new bonding materials. As a consequence of that disaster, the Ministry for Buildings and Structures decided in December 2006 to change the Still, even including that event, structures in Germany remain an extremely safe technical product. In Germany in 2004, about 17,293,678 residential buildings (Knobloch 2005) and about 5,247,000 non-residential buildings (SBA 2005) were in use. The entire population of 80 million people is virtually exposed more than 20 h per day. Thus, an average yearly fatality number, of 10 is extremely low.",

In 2000-2001, an overpass over a freeway interchange was erected. During the erection of the superstructure, a rather low concrete strength was reached. Many experts were asked about the cause, and heavy discussions took place about the possible reasons and who was to be blamed. At last, it turned out additives for the concrete production were produced in a chemical plant, which had accidentally labeled textile softener as concrete additive. The textile softener caused an insufficient low strength of the concrete, and the superstructure blasted right after construction in the summer of 2001. Another example is a highway bridge in Saxony close to Dresden, Germany, where during the pouring of concrete for the superstructure, too few concrete workers were at the site. Therefore, the concrete was not properly compacted and the concrete structure through test drillings was shown to have hollow cavitations. This, of course, decreased the effective cross-section of the bridge and, therefore, strongly influenced the load-bearing capacity. Parts of the bridge thus had to be rebuilt again.",

In one case, the gradient on a new bridge was wrong, and some workers were asked to grind off the concrete to meet the required gradient.

This is a latent phenomenon and does not have to result in disasters. As a result of this, control mechanisms have been developed and employed in many fields. strange since one would assume that heavier loads are experienced during the usage time of the structure. However, this is not always the case. For example, on a bridge a situation might arise where, during the time of construction, a heavy mass transport of earth from one side of the valley to the other side is carried out by big trucks over the unfinished bridge. Here, maximal loading is experienced during the construction phase. Also the structure might not be finished and, therefore, the proper statical system is not yet activated. Some part of the structure may, therefore, experience a load which it will never experience again in such a magnitude. This change of system and special load types during construction can be seen for a bridge built in incremental launching method. Here, the bridge is built on one side of the valley, and then moved section by section over the columns to the other side of the valley. The advantage of building with this technique is extremely good fabrication conditions. The bridge can then be produced at one place at the prefabrication area. However, the movement of pushing the bridge over the valley includes some special loads. In addition, since the bridge is pushed every week or every second week, the concrete material has not reached the final strength. It is, therefore, not surprising that many bridges or houses collapse during the construction phase. Table 2 -49 gives a list of known bridge failures. Here, the major cause of failure, approximately 25%, is during construction. If the collapse of the formwork is also considered a failure during construction time, then the figure reaches about 50%. In some cases, bridges also collapsed during load tests, as seen in Table 2 -50. Another major cause of failure is connected to accidental loads, such as impacts. Only 1/4 of the failures happened under regular conditions.",

For example, the absolute damage potential for this technology is much higher compared to other energy production technologies known so far. A study of the 19 nuclear power plant locations in Germany has assumed damages in an area with a diameter of 2,500 km and an affected population of 670 million people. Early fatalities and damages were assumed only in an area with a diameter of 20 km. After an initial 20,000 fatalities, another 100,000 fatalities, were estimated with a probability of 5.9 \u00d7 10 -5 per year (Hauptmanns et al. 1991 ). Many studies have been carried out to estimate the risks of this technology (GRS 1999).

Twenty-five `percent of the released material exited the reactor on the first day. The rest of the material was released over the next nine days into the environment. About 115,000 people were evacuated after the accident. So far, only the unit Becquerel has been introduced as a measure of radioactivity. However, other measures with relation to radioactivity should be mentioned as well. \"Gray\" is the measure for the absorbed dose. While Becquerel is given per second, Gray (Gy) is given in Joule per kilogram. The dose can be used to quantify damages to creatures. Unfortunately, exact lethal dose cannot be given, and therefore the so-called median lethal dose (LD 50 ) given. This is the dose killing 50% of the exposed population. For humans with a good medical treatment this value reaches about 5 Gy, whereas excellent medical treatment, might shift the LD 50 up to 9 Gy. Figure 2 -59 shows the distribution of the percentage of death from a population for some dose. A further measure related to the dose is the Sievert. The Sievert is also given in Joule per kilogram, but it considers the different effects of different types of ionizing radiation. \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-radiation have different consequences, and therefore the Sievert gives the opportunity to compute an equivalent dose.",

In the last 20 years, there were about 41 deaths due to lung cancer in Umhausen. Statistically, only six to seven cases were expected. The major cause for the high radioactivity was probably the very high permeability of the ground, which might have been caused by a huge rock or debris flow about 10,000 years ago. Radon is not only a major contributor to natural radiation in some regions, like in Umhausen or some parts of India. In Germany, Radon contributes to about 25% to the natural radiation (Br\u00fcske-Hohlfeld et al. 2006) . Moreover, radiation during flying has been considered as risk (Schraube 2006) . Although accidents have happened in nuclear power plants or nuclear weapon production and storage as shown in Tables 2-57 and 2-58, the overall contribution is rather low as shown in Table 2 -59.

A list of several tunnel fires can be found in Promat Tunnel (2008) , and in combination with the transport of hazardous materials in Cassini & Pons-Ineris (2000) (Fig. 2-64) . Much work was carried out after the accident in the Mont Blanc road tunnel in 1999 (Bergmeister 2006 , Krom & de Wit 2006 . Although high temperatures can be reached, the major problems with tunnel fires are the smoke and restricted orientation capability. It has been estimated that under an optical people unfamiliar with the tunnel are unable to find emergency exits. People who know the tunnel might find emergency exits with a visibility of 1m. However, in addition to limited visibility, the smoke also usually contains toxic materials like carbon monoxide or acids. With a carbon monoxide density between 600 and 800 ppm in air, humans become unconscious (Fileppo et al. 2004) .",

The velocity of an explosion is usually so high that humans are unable to identify the sequences of it. The speed of combustion can be used for the classification of fire and explosion, as shown in Table 2 Two of the biggest explosions in history were connected to ships that were loaded with gun powder. The first of these two disasters was the explosion on 6 December 1917 in Halifax, Canada. The French transport ship Mont Blanc was scheduled to transport gun powder to the European battlefields. The ship was loaded in November in New York with gun powder ship was supposed to enter the harbour of Halifax, Canada, prior to travelling to Europe. To sail to Halifax, the Narrow Canal had to be navigated before entering the city harbour. The Norwegian freighter Imo tried at the same time as the Mont Blanc to enter the Narrow Canal. Additionally, the Norwegian freighter was travelling at potentially double the allowed speed in the canal and rammed into the Mont Blanc. The collision parts of the Imo bored into the starboard side of the Mont Blanc. Benzene barrels on the deck of the Mont Blanc were damaged and leaked. Unfortunately, the captain of the Imo decided to free his ship again. As a consequence, benzene was ignited by the friction between the metal parts of the ships scrapping against each other, and further benzene barrels exploded on the deck of the Mont Blanc. Therefore, the entire front part of the Mont Blanc stood in flames. The firefighting capacity of the ship was overburdened and unable to extinguish the fire. The captain of the ship, however, did not decide to sink the Mont Blanc but to abandon it. The ship then did not just explode but floated towards Richmond, a suburb of Halifax. It reached the Some examples of major explosions will now be provided. In 1645, a gun powder tower in Delft exploded. The explosion was heard within a 80km radius. Nowadays, there is a market place at the origin of the explosion. In 1807, a boat loaded with gun powder exploded in the Dutch city of Leiden. About 150 people were killed, including 50 children. It was said that Napoleon visited the site of explosion and wrote an Imperial decree dealing with the location of factories inside cities based on their hazardous level. It is surprising to note that this still has not been successfully applied in practice even after 200 years. Therefore, since 1807, the number of explosions inside cities has continued to rise. For example, there was a large explosion of gun powder in 1867 in Athens (Ale 2003) .",

Tables 2-70, 2-71 and 2-72 can help in determining the proper distance of each plant from residential areas. There are three different distance classifications: explosive zone, damage zone and attention zone. The explosive zone is in close proximity to the explosion itself. It is defined by an overpressure higher than 0.6 bars. The damage zone is located between an overpressure of 0.6 and 0.07 bars. Here, deadly injures can occur. In the A comparable disaster happened during World War II in 1944 in Bombay. Here, a ship, the Fort Stikene, was loaded with 1,400 tonnes of gun powder. The ship was also transporting cotton and dry fish at the same time. It was scheduled to be unloaded on 13 April 1944. In the morning, the unloading began. In the afternoon, a fire in the cotton was found. For two and half hours, the crew tried to stop the fire, but they failed. Even worse, on the outside of the ship, a glowing spot had become visible. The fire spread out, reaching the sectors of the ship with the gun powder. Again, the ship was not sunk or pulled out of the harbour. When the ship exploded, around 13 ships in the neighborhood were lost. In a radius of 400 m, all buildings experienced heavy damages, including 50 storage facilities. The glowing parts of the ship ignited hundreds of fires in the city and began to spread. Two days later, on 15 April, the fires reached the centre of the city. The fire reached to such an intensity that it was visible from approximately 120 km away. To avoid the complete loss of Bombay, a fire protection stripe of a width of 400 m was formed. The explosion caused 1,500 fatalities, 3,000 injuries and left countless people homeless (Korotikin 1988). thrid zone, the attention zone, no fatalities should occur, but injuries can happen. The pressure reaches up to 0.03 bars. Obviously, residential areas are only permitted in the attention zone. As an example, an industry storage facility with 20 tonnes of explosive materials is considered. The explosive zone then reaches approximately 70 m, the damage zone reaches about 420 m and the attention zone reaches about 1,200 m. Therefore, the storage has to have a minimum distance of 420 m from the nearest residential area.",

It has been estimated that more than 8,000 miners have a fatal accident per year in China. For example, in July 2001, about 200 miners died due to water breaking into a stannary. However, mining disasters have a long history. For example, in the Ruhr area, mining had already started in the 13th century. The exploitation of galleries started there in the 16th century. In 1881, an authority required that every mine has to have two vertical tunnels. This indicates that mitigation measures had been applied probably based on some fatal accidents. However, even so, the severity of such accidents has not decreased over the years, as shown in Table 2 -73. Fig. 2-65 .

While in earlier centuries crop failure due to bad weather conditions was the major risk, new risks have emerged, for example, with artificial food additives. The population is extremely sensitive to risks related to food, since food is a general Italy Poison attack on mineral water and milk products cows. Independent from that theory, sick animals were used for the production of ruminant feed, resulting in the illness of more than 200,000 cows. The number of precautionary slaughters may have run into millions. The scrapie disease has been well known since about 200 years ago, and the old farmer rule, not to use meat from such sheep, may have prevented the transmission of BSE to humans in previous times. However, the transmission from cows to other mammals has been proven, and therefore the species barrier can be exceeded. A comparable disease is already known from epidemics in Papua New Guinea. Therefore, intensive scientific works were carried out to discuss the transmission of BSE to humans. Since the middle of the 1990s, a modified version of the Creutzfeld-Jakob disease has been observed. However, the proof of the causal relationship seems to be extremely difficult. Nevertheless, in contrast to the original Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, now even young people are hit by the disease. One of the greatest disasters in industrial food production was probably the BSE epidemic in Great Britain and Europe. It has been found that the BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) originating from sheep infected with scrapie. Unfortunately, several years ago, the idea was born to recycle these sick sheep using their animal protein for ruminant feed production. Other theories consider the spontaneous jump of the disease from sheep to Currently less than 200 people are infected with the disease. This is a rather low number, but considering an incubation time period of almost 20 years, numbers can still increase dramatically. Recent studies show that incubation time and the probability of a disease depends on the genotype (Dittberner 2004 , Worth Matravers et al. 2000 , Prusiner 1995 , Carrell 2004 .",

It includes, for example, coronary diseases, cardiac insufficiency, local asphyxia, (mostly) myocardial infarction, high blood pressure and strokes. The diagnosis is based on several techniques, such as anamneses, identifying family risks, diagnosis of the body, electrocardiogram, blood diagnosis or angiographies. Although it is the elderly who are generally exposed to this disease, some progress has been made over the last decades to decrease the incidence and mortality rates associated with this disease. For example, Finland, which experienced an over proportional burden of cardiovascular diseases, introduced a special preventive program in the 1980s. This program included the regular control of blood pressure, the prohibition of smokings, launching the subject \"health and hygiene\" in schools and the stimulation of the industry to provide low fat and low salt food. As a consequence of the program, the number of cardiovascular disease dropped (Walter 2004) . Not only the incidence rate dropped, however, but also the mortality rate dropped through the improvement of medications like beta blockers, thrombolysis or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. It has been assumed that about 2/3 of the decrease in deaths is based on preventive measures, and about 1/3 is based on acute treatment. Therefore, an early identification of people at risk is necessary. Investigations to identify major risk groups include the: The studies have so far identified the so-called causal risk factors (Table  2 -75), conditional risk factors and predisposing risk factors. The four major risk factors are hypertension, smoking, hypercholesteremia and diabetes. They can explain about 75-85% of all new cases. Risk calculators can be found on the internet, for example at Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster (2007) or at BNK (2007) . A good news about these risk factors is the fact that they are reversible or treatable. Further risk factors, which are still under discussion, include Hypertriglyceridemia, Lipoprotein-a, hyperhomocystinemia, hypercoagulability, c-reactive protein (CRP), processes of inflammation and coronary calcium deposit (WHO 2003 , Schaefer et al. 2000 , Fargeman 2003 , Marmot & Elliott 1995 , Keil et al. 2005 , Kolenda 2005 .

Although the numbers are imposed for the US, they can be extended to most developed countries. It is quite interesting to note how high such lifetime values are. For example, one in every three people will be confronted with skin cancer at some point during their lifetime. Also, every tenth smoker will be hit by some cancer. It has been estimated that about 1/4 of all cancers are connected to smoking. Figures 2-68 and 2-69 show relations between cancer and smoking. Furthermore, chemicals seem to be able to cause cancer. About 2,000 chemicals have proven to be carcinogens in animal experiments (Henschler 1993) . Relations with some special professions or special type of living have been found centuries ago (Table 2-77). Causes for cancer are shown in Fig. 2-70 . However, since ionising radiation is often considered as cancer risk, in Figs. 2-71 and 2-72, the causes of radiation are given again to show how such causal chains can be extended to describe causes.

This overly large number should be avoidable with current knowledge (Razum & Breckenkamp 2007 , IFRC 2006 . In some endogenous societies, the infant mortality rate reaches up to 30% (Schiefenh\u00f6vel 2004) . This is a value close to that of animals. For example, for tigers in the Bangladesh swamps, the pup mortality rate reaches 60% in the first three months. Fortunately, the infant mortality rate in developed countries yields much better values. In many countries, values less than 1% are reached. The lowest values are about 0.4%.

The distribution of these cases in relation to the different vaccinations is shown in Fig. 2-73 . Of course, if one looks over a longer period, the ratio changes. From 1990 to 2000, there were about 22 million vaccinations in Saxony alone, yielding to 23 cases of harm. Here, the major contribution came from the BCG vaccination (Bigl 2007).",

Aspirin has been proven to drop the probability of cardiac infarctions or strokes. On the other hand, it increases the probability of gastrorrhagia and cerebral apoblexy. Therefore, this pharmaceutic might be applied as a safety measure. However, it might also decrease the safety for patients in other areas. While advantages and disadvantages can be weighed against each other, it becomes more difficult when a combination of different pharmaceutics is taken, which and therefore might increase the risks to patients. Smith et al. (1966) showed an exponential growth of adverse effects of pharmaceutics related to the linear growth of drugs administered. The identification of such adverse effects based on the application of different pharmaceutic is very difficult, as shown in Table 2 -82. Usually the number of investigated patients during the registration phase lies between 3,000 and 5,000, and during the limited registration of three years between 10,000 and 100,000. It should be mentioned that the registration of a new pharmaceutic costs about 500 million Euros. It has been estimated that about 6% of all hospitalisation is caused by such adverse effects. Adverse effects yield to about 0.1%-0.2% of all deaths. About 80% of these deaths may be avoidable (Fauler 2006) .",

For example, in 1957, there was an outbreak of Asian influenza with approximately 1 million fatalities, and in 1968 there was an outbreak of Hong Kong influenza resulting in about 700,000 fatalities. The latest influenza pandemic threat occurred in 2006 when a mutation of the H5N1 bird flu virus was thought to have occurred.

However, even \"normal\" influenza seasons in Germany claim several thousand victims as shown in Table 2-83. Since the 16th century, about 30 influenza pandemics have been identified.

The mortality rate depends on the type of plague, but has historically reached values of 95% for the lung plague, 75% for the bubonic plague or 100% for the sepsis. The plague usually originates from plague reservoirs located in the north of Asia, such as Siberia or Mongolia. Iran and Africa are sometimes mentioned as places of origin (Roche 1993). The first historical data concerning the plague can be found in a description of the siege of Athens during the pelopennical wars in about 430 B.C. Approximately one-third of the Athens population died at this time by the plague. In 170 A.D., there were some plague epidemics in the eastern part of the Roman Empire. In 542, the Justinian plague destroyed all goals of the Emperor Justinian to re-establish the Roman Empire. In 630 A.D., a plague epidemic occurred in the Persian Empire (Leberke 2004 , Grau 2004 .",

The city was beset for quite some time. It was unclear whether the disease started inside the city or in the lines of the besieger. After the beset was over, the Genoese traders returned to Genoa, halting at Constantinople, Messina and Naples. It was in these places that the plague occurred first. The pandemic then reached virtually the whole of Europe. First, Italy was hit, followed by Vienna in 1348 and then England and Scandinavia in 1350. Even Iceland was touched by the disease. Whether the information about the number of fatalities is correct remains uncertain. It seems rather certain, however, that many regions were almost completely depopulated and became deserted. In Italy alone, it took about a century to restore the population number to what it was before the plague.",

In 1720 and 1814, a plague epidemic occurred in France and Belgrade, respectively. Even at the end of the 19th century, a pest pandemic was observed in Asia, starting in 1894 in Hong Kong and reaching China, Japan and India in 1896. It has been estimated that about 15 million people died. By trade ships, this pandemic also reached Suez in 1897 , South Africa in 1899 , San Francisco in 1900 and Paris, in 1920 . In Paris, only 20 cases were observed. The last plague epidemic was observed in 1911 in Manchuria and fought off successfully. Based on World Health Organisation data, about 1,000-3,000 cases still appear per year worldwide. In 1994 in India, an epidemic centre was identified. In general, the data show that the hazard posed by the plague has been permanently decreased over the last centuries.

The abortion can be done either in an active way by carrying out a certain dangerous action, for example jumping from a structure, or else by endangering life-supporting actions like avoiding medicine or addicted to drinking. The worldwide number of successful suicides has been estimated by about 1 million per year. However, this value shows geographical patterns as well as change over time. In Germany, the number of suicides has dropped from 18,700 in 1982 to about 12,000 in 2000 (Helmich 2004 , Eichenberg 2002 . Maximum suicide rates were reached in the region of the former USSR ( Fig.  2-79) . In comparing between genders, more males commit suicides than females. In Russia, males commit up to four times as many suicides as females, whereas in Germany the suicide rate for men is about double that of women. Fig. 2-79 . Development of the suicide rate in Russia (Felber 2004) The suicide rate is not constant acron life stages. In general, one can state that the suicide rate increases with increasing age. Every second women carrying out a suicide is older than 60 years. Suicide rates reach a peak in youth. In the age bracket of 15 and 29 years, suicide is the second highest cause of death (Dlubis-Mertens 2003) .",

However, in most cases, depression is caused by a single dramatic social event, such as the loss of job, the loss of a partner or the loss of a child. These are damages to the social network in which people live, and if the remaining social network is not strong enough to heal the injury, then the individual human might fail. ",

Even worse though were the famines and epidemics. A detailed summary of victims was given by a royal Prussian doctor in the 19th century in the book \"History of epidemics, famine and war during the time of the 30 year war\". For example, the Mark Brandenburg lost about half its population. However, it should be mentioned that the population was often uprooted, not killed. Therefore, the number of fatalities might be lower. During that time, it was not permitted for farmers to move away from their villages. Many farmers used the chaotic situation during the war to escape to the growing cities. Hence, of the 30-year war yielded to an uprooting of the German population.",

After the war, the population was estimated to be approximately 13.5 million. The loss of the Netherlands and Bohemia is already included in the numbers. Although the 20th century showed the highest number of war fatalities, wars have probably been a permanent companion of human development. Wars were lead during the old Egyptian time, during the time of the Greeks, during the Roman Empire, during the migration time and throughout the medieval ages. Table 2 -86 gives the numbers of war fatalities for some major wars throughout the last five centuries. In contrast to the historic wars, especially during the early ages and the medieval ages, the weapons in modern times have reached a much higher destruction power. The development of the destruction power is given in Table 2 -87 in terms of explosive power and killing index. The explosive power is given in the mass equivalent of TNT. The killing index, which is used in some armies for qualification, gives the number of possible targets. Of course, this number is rather a theoretical value, which considers only the maximum gun speed. It does not consider any logistic problems with ammunition. Based on Table 2 -87, the highest destruction capacity is found with the application of nuclear bombs (Albrecht 1985) . fission as the explosion energy supply. As already mentioned, the explosive power is usually given in the mass equivalent of TNT. The nuclear fission energy supplied by 1 gram U-235 corresponds with 2 \u00d7 10 4 kg TNT or 8.2 \u00d7 10 10 Joule. Nuclear fission is usually initiated by the bombardment of nuclides U-235 and Pu-239 with neutrons. Because nuclear fission produces free neutrons after it has started, a chain reaction can be designed. Such a chain reaction depends on the critical mass. A typical critical mass is 50 kg U-235. Because the theoretical critical load can be decreased by some technical measures, smaller bombs with less weight (two orders of magnitude) are possible. The bomb over Hiroshima used only 1 kg U-235, reaching an explosive power of about 2 \u00d7 20 7 kg TNT. In contrast to the above, nuclear fusion bombs obtain their energy from nuclear fusion. While the size of bombs based on nuclear fission is limited due to the effect of critical masses, the explosive power of nuclear fusion bombs is infinite due to the possible unlimited production and storage of deuterium. In 1962, a H-bomb was ignited 400 km above the Pacific Ocean. Although the explosion of the 1.5 \u00d7 10 9 kg TNT equivalent bomb happened 1,500 km away from Honolulu, it yielded to a collapse in the energy supply there. The bomb with the highest explosive power was launched in 1960 by the USSR with an equivalent mass of 6 \u00d7 10 10 kg TNT (Rennert et al. 1988) .",

The bomb would be ignited about 2 km above the city (Tables 2-89 and 2-90) . The thermal radiation of the explosion would yield to heavy fires in the city. The heavy radiation would be followed by a shock wave, which might partially extinguish some fires and cause new fires by transporting burning material. The fire would grow into a firestorm. The heat of the fire produces a wind with a speed of up to 160 km per hour. Such a wind would blast huge amounts of ash into the atmosphere. If one considers that perhaps hundreds of cities would experience such a tragedy, during a nuclear war it becomes clear that inconceivable amounts of dust and ash would be transported into the air. Such huge masses would heavily influence the shielding of the earth's surface from sunlight and would yield to a dramatic temperature drop. This is called nuclear winter.

Such impacts can be preliminarily defined by the requirement for help (medical staff, fire brigades, police and army). A catastrophic terrorist event can cause damages that yield to the rupture of normal life in a city, region or country. This was very visible after the World Trade Center attacks, when air traffic from and to the eastern part of the US was completely closed down. Such secondary effects very often cause a much higher damage when compared to the direct initial damage not only in terms of financial values but also in terms of trust in the society and changes in the system. For example, in 2005 when an attack using liquid bombs at London Heathrow was planned, the boarding regulations for all airports inside the EU region was changed, which affected millions of passengers. Therefore, some countries, for example the Netherlands, have introduced a policy to restore normal life, since complete safety measures against intelligent terrorist attacks are impossible under normal living conditions. For example, after a terrorist bomb attack, security checks could be strengthened not only at airports but also at railway stations, buses, schools and universities and even supermarkets. This would completely alter the standard living conditions. The classification of disastrous and non-disastrous terrorist attacks is are considered and treated by regular emergency help, whereas incidents mainly separated by the number of casualties. Usually 300-500 casualties As already mentioned, terrorist attacks quite often occur in local and temporal clusters. Example of this, are the bomb warnings and attacks in the UK during the 1980s and 1990s. Many readers will probably remember the warnings during Christmas time at shopping centres or subways in London. Here, the terror attacks were strongly related to the independence endeavours in Northern Ireland; such examples can also be found in other surpassing this number require additional emergency help from neighbouring 2.6 Social Risks 235 areas.

The health consequences of alcohol addiction can be diverse. For example, a chronic consumption of about 60 g of pure alcohol by males and about 20 g of pure alcohol by females can cause a cirrhosis of the liver as well as psychological successor diseases.
