For instance, ecologically and phylogenetically disparate virus populations may exhibit striking concordance in phylogeographical structure across historical barriers to gene flow. Whereas a large number of such studies on the structure of animal and human RNA viruses have been reported, there have been few similar studies of plant RNA viruses (Garc\u00eda\u2010Arenal et al. 2001). In addition, very few studies on genetic populations using sequence\u2010based analysis have been reported, whereas several studies of plant viruses have used molecular markers (Tsompana et al. 2005).",

            "text": "\nTurnip mosaic virus (TuMV) was ranked second only to Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) as the most important virus infecting field\u2010grown vegetables in a survey of their virus diseases in 28 countries and regions (Tomlinson 1987; Walsh & Jenner 2002). TuMV infects a wide range of plant species, most from the family Brassicaceae. It is probably the most widespread and important virus infecting both crop and ornamental species of this family throughout the world, and especially threatens cultivated brassicas in East Asia (Provvidenti 1996; Tomimura et al. 2003). TuMV belongs to the genus Potyvirus. This is the largest genus of the largest family of plant viruses, the Potyviridae (Shukla et al. 1994; Fauquet et al. 2005), which itself belongs to the picorna\u2010like supergroup of viruses. TuMV, like other potyviruses, is transmitted by aphids in the nonpersistent manner (Hamlyn 1953). Potyviruses have flexuous filamentous particles 700\u2013750 nm long, each of which contains a single copy of the genome, which is a single\u2010stranded positive sense RNA molecule of about 10 000 nucleotides (nts). The genomes have terminal untranslated regions flanking a single open reading frame. The single large polyprotein hydrolyses itself after translation into at least 10 proteins (Riechmann et al. 1992; Urcuqui\u2010Inchima et al. 2001). The protein 1 (P1) gene, situated at 5\u2032 end of the genome, encodes a serine proteinase and is the protein with the greatest between\u2010species variation. Even though P1 enhances amplification and movement of the virus, it is not strictly required for viral infectivity (Verchot et al. 1992; Klein et al. 1994). The 6K protein 2 (second 6\u2010kda protein) is involved in viral long\u2010distance movement and symptom induction (Restrepo\u2010Hartwig & Carrington 1994). The viral genome\u2010linked protein (VPg) is a multifunctional protein with several suggested roles in the viral infection cycle; it may act as a primer for RNA replicase during virus multiplication, possibly through direct interaction with the viral RNA polymerase, and it has essential functions in host genotype specificity (Schaad et al. 1997). The nuclear inclusion a proteinase (NIa\u2010Pro) cleaves the polyprotein (Parks et al. 1995). The coat protein (CP) is involved in aphid transmission, cell\u2010to\u2010cell and systemic movement, encapsidation of the viral RNA and regulation of viral RNA amplification (Atreya et al. 1991; Dolja et al. 1994). CP sequences have been studied extensively to assess the difference within and between potyvirus species (Urcuqui\u2010Inchima et al. 2001).",

            "text": "Phylogeographical analysis looks for congruence between the phylogenetic and geographical relationships of organisms. It thereby elucidates the processes that underlie the genetic diversity of populations in space and time. We therefore decided that to better understand the evolution of host/virus interactions of TuMV, it was important to determine in more detail the molecular changes that occurred during the evolution of its populations. Our earlier studies have shown that the Asian TuMV subpopulation has probably emerged from the more ancient Eurasian subpopulation (2003, 2004). In both regions, Brassica crops are an important component of local agriculture, but in Europe the crops are mostly Brassica species whereas in Asia they are both Brassica and Raphanus species. It is of particular interest to evaluate the impact of recombination in shaping potyvirus populations. However, the structure of potyvirus populations has rarely been analysed at the local scale, so that evolutionary processes determining the population structure of the species are often unknown (Moreno et al. 2004). Although Japan is close to China geographically, there is no evidence for plant virus migration between China and Japan.",

            "text": "The sequences of 196 isolates, collected worldwide, were obtained from the international gene sequence database and used for the recombination analyses. First, we joined the nt sequences of the P1, part C\u2010terminus of cylindrical inclusion protein (Ct\u2010CI, 3\u2032 terminal 63 nts), 6K2, VPg, NIa\u2010Pro and CP genes of each sequence, and called this its \u2018concat\u2019, namely a concatenated sequence analogous to a contiguous sequence or \u2018contig\u2019. Phylogenies were calculated from 29 equal slices of the aligned gene sequences. Only those from the region around nt 5501\u20136500 in degapped sequences, which we call region 12 (R12; see Tomimura et al. 2003), and which encodes from the Ct\u2010CI to the middle of NIa\u2010Pro nt sequences, gave trees calculated by three different methods [i.e. maximum\u2010likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP) and neighbour\u2010joining (NJ), as described below] that were almost identical to those constructed from entire genomic sequences. The concats were used for evolutionary analyses. The corresponding regions of two sequences of Japanese yam mosaic virus (JYMV) (Fuji & Nakamae 1999, 2000), one of Scallion mosaic virus (ScMV) (Chen et al. 2002) and one of Narcissus yellow stripe virus (NYSV) (Chen et al. 2003) were used to align the TuMV concats, as blast searches had shown them to be the sequences in the international sequence databases most closely and consistently related to those of TuMV; TuMV P1 genes were more closely related to those of JYMV than ScMV, whereas for some other TuMV regions/genes such as R12 and the remainder of NIa\u2010Pro gene it was the converse, except that the TuMV CP gene was most closely related to that of NYSV. We thus aligned all 196 P1 sequences with those of two JYMV isolates as the outgroup, the R12 + Pro sequences with those of JYMV and ScMV, and the CP sequences with that of NYSV using clustal x (Jeanmougin et al. 1998). However, this procedure resulted in some gaps, which were not in multiples of three nts. Therefore, the amino acid sequences corresponding to individual gene regions, together with the appropriate outgroups shown above, were aligned using clustal x with transalign (kindly supplied by Georg Weiller) to maintain the degapped alignment of the encoded amino acids, and then the separate gene regions reassembled to form sequences 3315 nts long. The aligned sequences were checked for incongruent relationships, which might have resulted from recombination, using rdp (Martin & Rybicki 2000), geneconv (Sawyer 1999), bootscan (Salminen et al. 1995), maxchi (Maynard Smith 1992), chimaera (Posada & Crandall 2001) and siscan programs in rdp2 software (Martin et al. 2005), and phylpro (Weiller 1998) and siscan version 2 (Gibbs et al. 2000) programs in the original software. We first checked for incongruent relationships using phylpro and siscan version 2, and then the programs in rdp2, whose analyses were done using default settings for different detection programs and a Bonferroni\u2010corrected P\u2010value cut off of 0.05 or 0.01, and then all isolates that had been identified as likely recombinants by the programs in rdp2 were rechecked using phylpro and siscan version 2, reviewing not just the complete nt sequences but also the synonymous (ds) and nonsynonymous (dn) sites separately. In addition, we checked 100 and 50 nt slices of all the sequences for evidence of recombination using the same programs. These analyses also assessed which nonrecombinant sequences have regions that are most closely related to regions of the recombinant sequences, and hence indicate the likely lineages that provided those regions to the recombinants. For simplicity, we call these the \u2018parental\u2019 isolates of recombinants, although they are merely those that include the most closely related regions.",

For NJ analyses, distance matrices were calculated by dnadist with the Kimura two\u2010parameter option (Kimura 1980), and trees constructed from these matrices by the NJ method (Saito & Nei 1987). A bootstrap value for each internal node of the NJ trees was calculated using 1000 random resamplings with seqboot (Felsenstein 1985). The calculated trees were displayed by treeview (Page 1996). One ScMV and two JYMV sequences were used as the outgroup to construct a phylogenetic tree of the concats, because the CP sequence of only one NYSV isolate was available (Chen et al. 2003). The JYMV and ScMV sequences corresponding to individual gene regions within the concats were aligned as the encoded amino acids using clustal x with transalign to maintain the degapped alignment of the nts and then reassembled to form sequences 2979 nt long.",

This showed that some were phylogenetically anomalous, and these were examined by the \u2018sister scanning\u2019 method (siscan version 2) (Gibbs et al. 2000) to determine whether these anomalies resulted from recombination rather than convergent selection. Then, the programs in the rdp2 package (Martin et al. 2005) were used to confirm whether the RSs detected by the phylpro and siscan programs were likely. Recombination detecting programs can be grouped by their basic assumptions; for instance, bootscan (Salminen et al. 1995), rdp (Martin & Rybicki 2000) and siscan programs are phylogenetic methods, whereas geneconv (Sawyer 1999), maxchi (Maynard Smith 1992) and chimaera (Posada & Crandall 2001) programs are substitution methods, and the phylpro program is a distance comparison method (Posada & Crandall 2001).",

(2004) had statistically significant \u2018conflicting relatedness signals\u2019 in nts that differed synonymously from those in other sequences. The phylpro program was used to search for the \u2018parental lineages\u2019 of East Asian recombinant sequences. However not all sequences that had different relationships in adjacent 50 or 100 nt sequences showed clear phylogenetic anomalies in phylpro (Tan et al. 2004). We therefore used siscan to check 50 and 100 nt slices of all Eurasian sequences for evidence of recombination either using all nts, or using those that had ds or dn changes separately. Table 3 summarizes the location of crossover sites found in the East Asian genomes by the seven recombination detecting programs, and Fig. 2 shows the different patterns of RSs in those recombinants together with a list of the sequences in which the various patterns were found. There seemed to be at least 20 RSs in the TuMV genomes and 17 recombination type patterns (A\u2010Q, Fig. 2) in the East Asian population. Fourteen of the 20 RSs seemed to be derived from parents from different major lineages (i.e. interlineage RSs), seven RSs seemed to be derived from parents from the same major lineage (i.e. intralineage RSs). Most of RSs were detected by all programs; therefore, we called these \u2018clear\u2019 RSs, but two intralineage RSs at around nts 6121 and 6300 in the VPg gene were only detected by some programs and one of the parents had an RS at the same site, and thus, further analyses will be required to clarify this anomaly. We therefore considered these sites to be \u2018tentative\u2019 RSs or false positives, and so recombination type patterns K and M may be artefacts. Two of the different recombination patterns (I and J) were found in many isolates. The other recombination patterns were only found in the genomes from three or fewer isolates. Isolates with patterns I were found in China and Japan, whereas patterns A, C\u2010G, J and O\u2010Q were found only in Japanese isolates and patterns B and L only in those from China. Isolates with pattern N, the mosaic genome pattern with basal\u2010BR sequence, were found in both China and Korea but not in Japan. In summary, the Japanese population seemed to have a greater number of different recombination patterns than the Chinese (Table 4).",

The Chinese isolates fell into both the Asian\u2010BR and world\u2010B groups, whereas Japanese isolates occurred in all three groups.

Both the \u20181999\u2010tree\u2019 and the \u20182000\u2010tree\u2019 partitioned the sequences into three groups, basal\u2010BR, Asian\u2010BR and world\u2010B, whereas the basal\u2010BR group consisting many Japan/Kyushu isolates appeared after 1999. Temporal information can also be obtained from trees, because if different lineages are evolving at similar rates then the lengths of the branches, or the diversity of different parts of the tree, give an indication of their age. This is probably legitimate for this TuMV data as the paml and mega analyses described above revealed almost no significant selection differences between the lineages except in the Taiwanese population. The nt diversity (average number of nt substitutions per site in each pair of sequence variants) was estimated for each genomic region (P1, 6K2, VPg, NIa\u2010Pro and CP genes), each country population, each lineage and each collection period. These analyses showed appreciable differences between the lineages. The P1 gene was the most variable when all isolates were compared, but not, as would be expected, when different country populations/lineages of the isolates were considered separately (data not shown). The Chinese populations of both Asian\u2010BR and world\u2010B isolates were more diverse than the Japanese populations in most of the genes examined, suggesting that the Chinese populations may be older, although to confirm this it will be necessary to compare nt diversities of the isolates collected in comparable areas of China and Japan. However, when the pre\u2010 and post\u20101999/2000 populations of Chinese isolates were compared, they were found to be closely similar; the later ones from Kyushu were significantly more diverse (data not shown). Interestingly, isolates of the two basal\u2010BR sublineages that appeared in Japan during and after 2000 had less than one quarter the diversity of the Asian\u2010BR and world\u2010B isolates (Table 6). The average year of collection of the pre\u2010 and post\u20101999/2000 populations in China and in Japan was 2 and 4 to 5 years apart, respectively.",

For populations experiencing long\u2010term demographic stability, the stochastic process of lineage extinction via genetic drift produces a ragged multimodal distribution. On the contrary, in the recently expanded and still intact population, the majority of lineage coalescence events are expected to post\u2010date the expansion, producing a smooth unimodal Poisson distribution around the time of expansion, reflecting the star\u2010like phylogeny of alleles due to the accumulation of low frequency mutations since the expansion. In addition, nt polymorphism of TuMV populations were estimated using Tajima's D, Fu & Li's D and F statistical tests (Table 6) because we were interested in discriminating between demographic expansion and contraction. These statistical tests are expected to have negative values for background selection, genetic hitchhiking and demographic expansion, and the negative values indicate that population maintained low frequency polymorphism. Because selection events such as genetic hitchhiking and background selection affect relatively small fractions of the genome, a multilocus trend of negative statistical values would indicate that demographic forces are acting on the population (Tajima 1989; Hey & Harris 1999; Tsompana et al. 2005). On the other hand, positive values are expected to be produced by balancing selection and a decrease of the population size. We found that the shapes of pairwise mismatch distribution for world\u2010B groups in all subpopulations were similar, and were ragged and multimodal, supporting long\u2010term demographic equilibrium or an insufficient number of samples (Fig. 5A, C, D, H). On the other hand, the shape of mismatch distribution for basal\u2010BR III group in Kyushu was smooth and unimodal and a good visual fit with the expectation of the sudden expansion model (Fig. 5G). Likewise, a highly significant values of Tajima's D, Fu & Li's D and F statistical tests supported demographic expansion of the same isolates (Table 6). Whereas the mismatch distribution for the Asian\u2010BR and basal\u2010BR II groups in Kyushu were not unimodal, the accumulation of low\u2010frequency mutations was characteristic of nonequilibrium population dynamics (Fig. 5E, F), and notably, the number of pairwise differences at the peak of the first \u2018wave\u2019 in the distribution was almost similar to that of basal\u2010BR III group of Kyushu, suggesting a recent demographic instability in the Asian\u2010BR and basal\u2010BR II groups of Kyushu.

In particular, we collected more than 60 TuMV isolates representing all regions of Kyushu island (approximately 42 000 km2), which is located at the southwest end of the main Japanese island chain and therefore is the island nearest to mainland continental China, this also involved resampling localities from which TuMV had been obtained before 2000. These isolates were cloned by single\u2010lesion isolations because of the high frequency of mixed infections in the field, not only with other viruses, especially CMV, but also other isolates of TuMV (approximately 2% in Kyushu), which had caused problems when gene sequencing for earlier studies (data not shown). Biological cloning is, of course, also mandatory when attempting to analyse recombinational events, so that one does not mistake a mixture of two distinct isolates as a recombinant (Ohshima et al. 2002; Moreno et al. 2004).",

All these have been continental\u2010scale studies. Whereas analyses of the structure of local populations are less frequently reported, they may be particularly informative (Garc\u00eda\u2010Arenal et al. 2000; Bateson et al. 2002; Moreno et al. 2004). For example, the increased frequency of recombinants in the CMV population of Spain was reported recently (Bonnet et al. 2005). In addition, there are few reports of phylogeographical studies of plant viruses (Tsompana et al. 2005) like that we report here of TuMV from species of Brassicacae in China and Japan. We have collected samples of nearly 300 plants of R. sativus, B. rapa, B. juncea and other crucifers showing mosaic symptoms plants, over the past decade in Kyushu island. However, although many of R. sativus plants reacted positively with TuMV antisera in enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests as it is relatively easy to detect TuMV in this species, it was more difficult to find TuMV\u2010infected Brassica plants. In the present study, only 17 TuMV isolates were found in Brassica plants in Kyushu and other area of Japan and all were involved in this study (Table 2).",

Our earlier studies showed that the mapping of recombinational events as well as phylogenetic relationships were useful for tracing the migration and evolution of TuMV (Tan et al. 2004). In the present study, many RSs in the P1 gene of the TuMV genome were similar in the Chinese and Japanese isolates. Although it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the RSs positions coincide with recombinational hotspots, it is also possible that genomes with the same recombination type pattern have a shared ancestor. In fact, from the analysis of the concat sequences, although number of isolates in recombination type patterns is different in each country, the isolates of recombination type pattern I, and nonrecombinants in Asian\u2010BR and world\u2010B groups migrated in both country populations (2, 3) and hence probably represent the successful \u2018founder\u2019 TuMVs of East Asia. However, although the recombination type patterns and nonrecombinants did not give additional insights, they were congruent with the relationships indicated by the phylogenetic analyses. Note that some of the conflicting signals attributed to recombinant events may be due to differences in rate of evolution among genes and among lineages.",

In TuMV, the P1 gene has the largest dn/ds ratio, whereas the NIa\u2010Pro has the smallest, indicating that different genes are under different selective constraints (Tomimura et al. 2004). In this study, we looked at the dn/ds ratios of five genes in the populations in each country and district, and found that the values for Chinese and Japanese isolates were almost identical but that for the Taiwanese population was much greater (Table 5), indicating that constraints in different local population may not be similar. We also tried to estimate dn/ds ratios of each lineage in each country using intralineage recombinant sequences (data not shown), but numbers of isolates available for these analyses were very small (see Fig. 4B,C), and no worthwhile estimate could be obtained.",

Such star phylogenies were seen in the Asian\u2010BR and basal\u2010BR groups of \u20181999\u2010tree\u2019 and \u20182000\u2010tree\u2019 (Fig. 4B, C). Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of isolates collected pre\u2010 and post\u20101999/2000 showed that new lineages of closely related basal\u2010BR II and III isolates appeared around Kyushu after 1999, and the sudden expansion of the isolates in the basal\u2010BR III lineage was strongly supported by the deviations from the neutral equilibrium model for the geographical lineages with overall lack of nt diversity (Table 6), and by the analysis for mismatch distribution within individual geographical group (Fig. 5). Mismatch distribution analysis provided evidence of sudden expansion of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Yeh et al. 2004). A combination for high haplotype diversity and low genetic diversity, assessed by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers, is taken as evidence of a recent population expansion after a genetic bottleneck (Grant & Bowen 1998) and this was found for a plant virus, TSWV, using nt sequences (Tsompana et al. 2005). This combination was especially seen in the basal\u2010BR III group of TuMV population, and this conclusion may also apply to this population, although RNA viruses may evolve faster than mtDNA, and nt mismatches may produce unusually large haplotype diversities. However, it is likely that the results obtained from the population of basal\u2010BR III indicate a sudden expansion after a bottleneck, namely a \u2018founder effect\u2019, confirming other conclusions of our study.",

On the other hand, no nonrecombinant basal\u2010BR isolates, like those found in southern Japan, were found in China. So the question then is from where did the basal\u2010BR lineage in Japan come? It may have originated in Japan, or from the TuMV population in other parts of the world and our existing phylogenetic evidence does not distinguish between these two possibilities. TuMV is transmitted by aphids in a nonpersistent manner but there is no record of seed transmission (Provvidenti 1980) although several potyviruses are. However, the occurrence of TuMV in broad bean (Vicia faba) and in saffron (Crocus sativus) in China (Hu et al. 1996; Chen & Chen 2000), in Allium ampeloprasum in Israel (Gera et al. 1997) and in Ranunculus (Ranunculus asiaticus) in Italy (Tomimura et al. 2004) indicates that the host reactions of TuMV, including its ability to be seed\u2010borne, may need to be re\u2010examined. The other alternative would be metapopulation events involving colonization and extinction as has been reported for several plant viruses including CMV, tobamoviruses and TSWV (Fraile et al. 1997; 2000, 2001; Tsompana et al. 2005).",

At present, the only effective control of TuMV is through the use of host plant genetic resistance, either conventional or transgenic, or by cross\u2010protection with attenuated strains. Hence, it is very important for us to understand the phylogeography of TuMV population in each country or region.
