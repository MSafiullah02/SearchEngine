It is caused by a specific mutation in the gene that codifies the globin beta-chain in the hemoglobin (Hb) molecule, which results in a substitution of glutamic acid by a valine in the 6th position of the chain, thus creating HbS. This Hb is polymerized in the red blood cell, causing an alteration in its shape and hemolysis, which causes acute events and progressive damage in different organs. In 1910 James Herrick was the first to describe the characteristic shape of the red blood cell (drepanocytes, sickle cell, from the Latin falx, falcis: \"sickle shape\"). Subsequently, Pauling et al. identified electrophoresis anomalies in HbS, and proposed the term \"molecular disease\" in 1949, thus demonstrating for the first time that the production of an abnormal protein could be the cause of a genetic disorder.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Definition"}, {"text": "There are several genotypes of the disease, causing different clinical manifestations.

In all of these, HbS represents the greatest proportion of Hb in the erythrocyte. Heterozygous patients inherent only one allele from their parents: the other allele is normal (HbA), and they are named carriers (HbAS) , and have what is known as \"sickle cell trait.\" Carriers are usually asymptomatic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 717, "end": 723, "text": "(HbAS)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Definition"}, {"text": "The distribution of HbS in the world indicates two factors: migration and the selection of individuals who are HbS carriers because of their resistance to malaria in endemic regions.

When red blood cells flow in microcirculation, Hb deoxygenation is caused, which involves a change in the composition of the molecule. HbS is less soluble in a deoxygenated environment (which can also be caused by stress, hypoxia, or acidosis), and therefore Hb is polymerized within the red blood cell, and its membrane is distorted, originating a rigid cell with poor deformability. Hb polymers trigger a cascade of events within the cell: a. Activation of transport channels, with potassium loss and cellular dehydration. b. Disruption of the red blood cell membrane, thus exposing it to membrane components, such as band 3 protein, which binds to specific antibodies, promoting erythrophagocytosis caused by macrophages. c.

Although this process requires HbS polymerization, the trigger event for vascular obstruction is a type of inflammation. This inflammation results from an interaction between the erythrocyte and vascular endothelium, causing obstruction and ischemia episodes, which are followed by a restitution of the vascular flow, causing tissue damage mediated by reperfusion. Then, oxidative stress is triggered, which causes adhesion molecule overexpression, increasing inflammatory cytokines synthesis and leukocytosis. Hemolysis also contributes to vaso-occlusion. Hemoglobin liberation in plasma, caused by intravascular hemolysis, generates superoxide radicals and hydroxyl, which are potent inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO). This compound is produced under normal conditions in the endothelium and regulates the basal vasodilator tone, inhibits platelets, hemostatic activation, and the expression of adhesion molecules dependent on the nuclear factor k\u03b2 (FNk\u03b2). Hb release into the plasma also causes endothelial dysfunction and NO resistance. Hemolysis also liberates arginase-1 in the erythrocyte, which metabolizes arginine into ornithine, exhausting the substrate required to synthesize NO. All of this helps to maintain hypercoagulability, with an increase in the platelet activation and the levels of procoagulant factors in the blood. It is important to note that acute and chronic inflammatory events happen in the lung because erythrocytes are exposed to relatively low O 2 tensions, as well as the slow flow of the cells.
