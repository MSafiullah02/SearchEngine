Hodinka, PhD During the last decade, significant advances have been made in the development and use of antiviral agents for the successful treatment of a number of viral infections.8, 51, 57 An expanding array of antiviral drugs are currently available for the management of infections caused by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), papillomaviruses, and hepatitis B and C viruses. The increased number and use of antiviral agents, however, has led to the emergence of drugresistant viruses, particularly in immunocompromised patients such as those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or hematologic malignancy or those who have undergone organ transplantation. For comprehensive reviews on specific viruses, see references 26, 41, 64, 81-83, and 102. Clinical situations that favor the development of resistance include long-term suppressive therapy, recurrent intermittent therapy, and the use of less than optimum doses of an antiviral agent. Generally, the emergence and isolation of drug-resistant viruses is associated more so with the therapeutic use of antiviral agents and does not seem to be caused by prophylactic treatment. As more patients fail to respond to appropriate therapy and additional antiviral agents are produced, it will also become important for diagnostic virology laboratories to provide rapid and practical antiviral susceptibility testing to assist physicians in defining drug resistance and choosing appropriate alternative therapies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 999, "end": 1014, "text": "81-83, and 102.", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "This review describes the major antiviral agents, their mechanisms of action, and the development of drug resistance following antiviral therapy.

There are a number of antiviral agents licensed for clinical use for the treatment and prophylaxis of herpesvirus infections (Table 1) . Most are nucleoside analogs that require conversion to mono-, di-, and triphosphate forms by either cellular kinases, viral kinases, or both to selectively inhibit the replication of herpesviruses. This class includes vidarabine, acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, idoxuridine, and trifluridine.

Although the mechanism of action for vidarabine is unclear, the drug is phosphorylated by cellular kinases to its triphosphate form and prevents viral DNA synthesis through inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase. Vidarabine has efficacy for the treatment of herpes encephalitis, neonatal HSV infection, herpes keratitis, and mucocutaneous HSV infection and zoster in the immunocompromised host. The drug is not easy to use, however, because of its toxicity, poor solubility in water, and rapid deamination in vivo to a less active compound, arahypoxanthine. As such, vidarabine is seldom used and has been largely replaced by acyclovir.

It is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration and is converted to its active triphosphate form of penciclovir by mechanisms that are similar to acyclovir. Like acyclovir, penciclovir has good in vitro activity against HSV and VZV and limited activity against EBV and CMV. Unlike acyclovir, penciclovir is not an obligate chain terminator but is an effective inhibitor of DNA chain elongation. Also, despite a less powerful inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase than acyclovir, famciclovir has a much higher oral bioavailability, and its active form is phosphorylated much more efficiently and has a significantly longer intracellular half-life in herpes-infected cells.
