These results are very similar to the relationship of serum and nasal antibody to risk of infection we previously observed with RSV in the same adult cohort [19, 20] .

However, the same issue was noted in our previous study of RSV infected patients in whom a relationship of low antibody status and risk of hospitalization could be demonstrated. It is possible that hMPV re-infection elicits a more brisk amnestic immune response than RSV, although given the close genetic relationship of these viruses this seems unlikely. Alternatively, hMPV related hospitalizations might be driven more by underlying diseases of the host rather than inadequate immunity to the pathogen. Several studies have suggested that illness due to RSV is more severe than hMPV in young children and underlying medical conditions and age appear to be risk factors for severe illness in adults [24, 25] . Yet, we observed similar rates of underlying cardiopulmonary diseases, diabetes and functional impairment to our previous cohort of patients hospitalized with RSV infection [21] .

The more exuberant antibody response observed in older adults may be due to immune dysregulation associated with poor viral clearance [26] . We observed a similar finding in a previous study of young and older adults infected with RSV [22] . While both viruses are members of the pneumovirus subfamily, these data suggest this observation represents a more general phenomenon associated with aging rather than a viral specific immune response.
