It is relevant to note that SARS, as the first novel pandemic threat of the new millennium, has clearly demonstrated that previously unknown pathogens can emerge from a wildlife source at any time in any place and without warning, threaten the health, well-being and economies of all societies. There was a clear need for countries to have the capability and capacity to maintain an effective alert and response system to detect and quickly react to outbreaks of international concern, and to share information about such outbreaks rapidly and transparently. Responding to pandemic threats requires global cooperation and global participation. Combined with the growing globalization of health risks and the importance of the human-animalecosystem interface in the evolution and emergence of pathogens, the best solution appears to be a One Health approach.",

Since 1970, new infectious diseases of humans have been discovered at an average rate of 1 every 8 months. Influenza pandemics are an economic issue: the World Bank has suggested that a low level pandemic could globally reduce production by almost 1% of gross domestic product, a moderate pandemic by almost 2% and a serious pandemic by as much as 5%, which would result in a serious economic recession. Zoonotic diseases that start to spread among humans are also a societal issue: SARS in 2003 and H1N1 influenza in 2009 have shown how quickly panic, stigmatization and mistrust towards governments and the scientific community can arise (even during clearly moderate epidemics). Effects may be long-lasting and have long-term consequences for populations' support of health measures. This emphasizes the important role of communication in health issues. Zoonotic diseases have security implications: 80% of known biological weapons have a zoonotic origin. Antimicrobial resistance develops and spreads at the animal human interface and is a major challenge to the future health of mankind. According to the World Bank the cumulative impacts by 2050 are $100 trillion and 10 million human deaths annually.

This means refocusing the constituency of GOARN by directly involving in-country technical agencies and partners that are dealing with any particular event, as well as the regional and global stakeholders that can provide additional capacity and support, if requested. One of the ways this is being put into practice is via a weekly teleconference to coordination on acute events which includes FAO and OIE and the appropriate local partner. For example, in responding to the current outbreak of Ebola in Equateur, this includes regional partners, and when possible national agencies. Likewise, during the recent Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria, the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) lead the response planning and participated actively with international partners. For the listeria outbreak in South Africa, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) South Africaa long standing partner in GOARNprovided technical information and kept international partners A further area for development is the building of rapid response capacities and teams. With so many events and the potential for any one of them to accelerate out of control, WHO and GOARN face great pressure to be able to identify very rapidly the core expertisewhich often needs to be individually tailoredthat can be deployed in a highly scalable way.",

Initially created as a 10-year, $20 billion initiative with a focus on CBRN-related challenges in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, the Global Partnership delivered impressive results that eliminated or mitigated a wide range of serious WMD threats. As a result of its success, the GP was extended and expanded to address threats posed by weapons and materials of mass destruction on a global basis.

In this regard, GP partners have forged enduing, mutually-supportive collaborations at the \"health-security interface\" at the global (e.g. WHO, OIE and FAO), regional (e.g. Africa, Asia, Caribbean) and national levels. GP partners recognize the imperative for stakeholders from diverse sectors and backgrounds (e.g. human health, animal health, academia, development, defense and security) to work together to prevent, detect and respond to all manner of biological incidents (whether natural, accidental or deliberate in origin) and to build impactful and sustainable health-security capacity. Canada's WTRP is a leader in the delivery of biological threat reduction programming and has supported dozens of countries over the years to, inter alia, strengthen biosafety and biosecurity for pathogens of security concern (e.g. anthrax and Ebola), enhance surveillance and diagnostic capabilities and improve capacities to prevent, detect and respond to biological threats. Major initiatives currently underway include projects to identify, secure and/or destroy vulnerable samples of Ebola virus in Africa support to the WHO and other international agencies to develop a new capacity to respond to the deliberate use of disease and the development of new solutions to enhance sustainable biosafety and biosecurity in low resource settings. In the delivery of global health security programming, Canada's WTRP has developed strong ties and collaborative partnerships with other Government of Canada agencies (e.g. Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Public Health Agency of Canada and the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg), international organisations (e.g. WHO, OIE and INTERPOL) and other GP partner countries (most notably the United Kingdom and the United States).",

In this plan, vaccination is mentioned as a tool to reduce AMU in humans as well as in animals (WHO-Global Action Plan). Vaccination against pathogens is a significant part of farm animal management. It should be stressed that vaccination is not a stand-alone measure but should be part of an integral approach including veterinary oversight, good biosecurity and husbandry practices, feed quality, climate and the use of diagnostics (OIE, ad hoc group, 2015).
