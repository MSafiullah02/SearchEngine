However, the contemporary discussion about Artificial Intelligence (AI) can often neglect the cultural influence of religion on such social systems and can occlude continuities of thought with religious conceptions of the world. Furthermore, these conversations can also present AI as a part of a teleological atheist narrative of rationality, or as a part of the larger technological modernity that drives a presumed secularisation of the world (Singler forthcoming). These views are similar in that they see the progress insinuated by our presumed \u2018modernity\u2019, an intellectual and historical category, as a counter to the mores of the \u2018backward\u2019 religious believer.",

The concept of \u2018entanglements\u2019 is employed here just as Courtney Bender does in her ethnography of New Agers and institutions in Cambridge Massachusetts (2010). Bender states that she begins \u201cwith the view that spirituality, whatever it is, and however, it is defined, is entangled in social life, with history, and in our academic and non-academic imaginations\u201d, and that, \u201cspiritual forms have thrived and been shaped by entanglements with the secular, including its powerful engagements with science and progress\u201d (2010, 5\u20136). Previous on- and offline ethnographic research has proposed an initial mapping of some of these existing entanglements, as well as providing examples of repeating forms and mutual influence between AI and religion (Singler 2017a).",

            "text": "There are many ways for approaching conceptions of AI. This article applies contemporary research methods from the overlapping and collaborative fields of anthropology and digital anthropology. The methodology is anthropological in its study of cultural trends, popular discourse, and personal interactions in a society influenced by the hype and reality of AI. In previous research, I have also been in contact with and interviewed individuals from the groups I am discussing in this article. This research also makes use of a digital, or virtual, fieldsite; digital anthropology often requires boundary-making, and by focussing down onto an \u2018Internet Event\u2019 (Hine 2000, 49) we create a virtual field-site for observation and participation. In this case, the BBtA tweets are the \u2018event\u2019, and this research has involved observing the connections, themes, identities, and motivations at play in this bounded \u2018moment\u2019 as well as noting trends through quantitative methods. This article also rests on the six core principles of digital anthropology as outlined by Horst and Miller (2012, 3\u201325) which, most simply put, argue for the value and reality of the digital existence for users and anthropological research. A more detailed discussion of digital anthropology and use of its approach appears in my ethnography of the Indigo Children (Singler 2017b, 19\u201338).",

            "text": "Other scholars recognise elements of theism in the discourse around AI and its potential impact on our future. Robert Geraci suggests in his 2010 book, Apocalyptic AI: Visions of Heaven in Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality, that AI can fulfil the same role in apocalyptic imaginings as a singular theistic god. Bearing in mind that the biblical apocalypse is an optimistic cosmic transformation, he also draws out parallels with the aims of AI, which often describe hopeful aspirations for a world-yet-to-come, an AI eschatology. In an early part of this particular work, Geraci draws on Rudolph Otto\u2019s 1917 description of god as mysterium tremendum et fascinans (Otto 1917), using it to identify a type of awe-inspiring and fearsome being that at different times in our history can be a god, or in our contemporary modern world, AI. Elsewhere, Geraci\u2019s work has engaged with virtual worlds, drawing attention to the role of transhumanists, including Giulio Prisco, discussed below, in claiming new potential spaces to practice and evolve religion towards transhumanist ends. In such spaces, including Second Life and the World of Warcraft (the MMORPG\u2014a massively multiplayer online role-playing game), Geraci argues a step closer to the fulfilment of transhumanist salvation is being made\u2014 \u201ca heavenly realm to inhabit\u201d (Geraci 2014 177). Twitter is another virtual space, but one dominated by discourse rather than aesthetics and virtual embodiment like Second Life and World of Warcraft. However, this article proposes that the expressions of religious metaphor, parody, and tropes on Twitter as in the BBtA tweets represent continuities of theism, continuities enabled by new technological spaces as well as uncertainties about the nature and the volition of \u2018the algorithm\u2019.",

These are omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence (Reed 2018, 7). Reed also raises the question of omnibenevolence. He notes that AI philosophers such as Nick Bostrom of the Future of Humanity Institute have focussed on the issues of malevolence through \u201cperverse instantiation\u201d, a failure of value alignment leading to unforeseen damage from a superintelligent AI, such as in Bostrom\u2019s famous Paperclip Maximiser thought experiment (Bostrom 2003).

Reed argues that apocalyptic interpretations may well be prescient, \u201cThat AI should be cast as god-like is understandable given these different intersecting cultural streams. The difference, though, is that a superintelligent artificial intelligence may become in fact an entity with god-like power and, therefore, presents a danger to humanity and a challenge to religion\u201d (Reed 2010, 12). This argument, however, misses quite how much such \u2018real world\u2019 apocalyptic scenarios and debates about value alignment are products of apocalyptic scientistic cultures themselves, and I find myself in agreement with Geraci on this point. Narratives influenced by existing Science fiction representations of AI also appear in apocalyptic AI thought experiments too and recognising the \u2018slippage\u2019 between fictional representations and non-fictional representations of AI is critical, and also, I propose, increasingly relevant to discussions of AI ethics.",

However, this article is not seeking solutions to value alignment problems, but instead pays attention to the theistic narratives that exist in our conceptions of AI. In which case, any algorithmic polytheism we see is interesting because of how it suggests that technology is encouraging alternatives to the cultural norms of monotheism that these users are likely more used to in a \u2018western\u2019 context.1 Another of the other interesting questions raised by Reed concerning ideas of god-like AI (and which is a subset of the value alignment/control question) is: \u201chow do we move a god?\u201d. This article does not seek to address this question from a theological perspective, that is not its methodological approach. Instead, through the BBtA tweets below, we will examine the number of ways people answer this particular question in a modern era with technology like AI in the \u2018god-space\u2019.",

As we see in her cautionary piece on \u201cThe Sorcery of Artificial intelligence\u201d (Herzfeld 2018):\u201cTo many, AI is likely to be as inscrutable as the spells in the sorcerer\u2019s magic book.

The theistic cultural currents involved in the BBtA tweets are, therefore, obvious through consideration of their content.

In previous work on new religious movements (NRMs) I have explored how online discourse\u2013including parody and metaphorical language\u2013can feed into the tripartite Weberian scheme for the legitimation of religion: charisma, rationality, and tradition. Commonly, the study of NRMs has focussed on the first of these, especially in relation to individual leaders originating and growing groups and movements. However, I showed how online conversations can form the basis of a \u2018new\u2019 tradition that can be referred to, leading to a snowballing of legitimation as the conversation online encourages more awareness of the NRM and more conversation about it (Singler 2014). In the case of BBtA we saw the spike of tweets and retweets in March 2018 due to the Coleman Lyft tweet, which is then followed by a larger conversation, even at this quite small sample size of 181 tweets overall. We can also recognise that these BBtA tweets exist within a broader, more diffuse and less quantifiable conversation outside of Twitter that also employs theistic tropes, narratives, metaphors, and religious parody about AI. A part of this conversation is the development of specific AI NRMs, which rest upon a bed of popular discourse, parody, and metaphor that imagines AI in theistic ways and which acquire legitimation through that very conversation.",

If Howe is correct, the sysop god behind our simulated universe would not be moved by this praise. Leaving aside questions of correct theology as they are outside the purview of the methodology of this article, we have noted that the BBtA tweets draw on a cultural monotheism narrative while also being inspired to some examples of polytheistic interpretations by the nature of the technology itself. This is a movement of conceptual foci in a different direction to Prisco\u2019s exploration of faith and technology. The latter takes lessons from existing religious worldviews and then applies them to the development of AI. But in the broader discourse outside of Twitter we see examples of theistic AI narratives. In the popular press and media, theistic metaphors and claims are employed for their evocative value, such as in headlines like: \u201cAn AI god will emerge by 2042 and write its own bible. Will you worship it?\u201d (Venturebeat 2017). Our AI gods are, therefore, already here, embedded in the way in which we tell stories about our technology.",
