            "text": "Fractional differentiation and fractional integration are considered as the effective tools for characterizing the behaviors of a large category of complex dynamical systems where the integer order systems cannot be applied. The non-locality and capacity of describing hereditary properties make fractional models more practical than the usual ones, especially for systems which involve memory [38, 39] . As a consequence, optimal control problems driven by fractional differential equations (DEs) have been also dramatically studied in theory with various useful applications. Especially, these model are very effective in modeling memory and hereditary properties of different materials and processes such as electrical circuits, fluid dynamics, biological models, and so forth, see [13, 21, 38, 39] . However, the nature of phenomena being studied are vagueness, imprecision and ambiguity. Thus, the fractional calculus in fuzzy environments has gained a significant achievement in the last decade. After introducing by Agrawal et al. [4] , fuzzy fractional DEs has attracted a large amount of research and achieved some noticeable results. On the theoretical side, Mazandarani and Kamyad [26] proposed a modified Euler method to solve initial value problems for fuzzy fractional differential systems under Caputo-type fuzzy fractional derivatives. A modified fixed point approach in generalized complete semi-linear metric space, namely extended Krasnoselskii's fixed point theorem, was discussed by Long and Dong in [25] and applied to investigate the solvability and Ulam-Hyers stability of nonlocal initial problem for implicit fractional fuzzy differential systems in [46] . In the literature [5] , Ali et. al. studied Riemann-Liouville fractional-order fuzzy BAM neural networks with time delay and impulsive. Based on contraction principle, Barbalat's lemma and Lyapunov function method, the authors proved the unique existence of equilibrium point of the considered model and its global asymptotic stability. For more details on theoretical results and applications, see [6, 24, 25, 41, 42] . Many effective approaches to study fuzzy fractional DEs have emerged in which the most recent approach base on the concept of granular differentiability and granular fractional differentiability introduced by Mazandarani et al. [27] and Najariyan et al. [31] . The granular differentiability is developed frome the idea of horizontal membership function of Piegat [35, 37] . This approach has shown its advantage for numerical methods of fuzzy fractional DEs. For more applications of granular differentiability to fuzzy differential equations and fuzzy fractional differential equations, see [28, 29, 43, 44, 45, 49] .",

            "text": "Optimal control theory is a branch of applied mathematics that deals with the problem to find the most suitable control input subjecting to a given dynamic system in order to minimize a performance index. In general, an optimal control is a set of differential equations describing the paths of the control variables that minimize a function of state and control variables, namely the cost function. Various optimization problems in both science and engineering associated with the integer optimal control of differential systems have studied for a long time by many authors, see for instance [10, 20, 28, 29] and the references therein. Recently, the optimal control problem reduces to a fractional optimal control problem (FOCP) when either the performance index or the dynamic constraints or both include at least one fractional-order derivative term. It is well-known that theory of fractional differential equations has paid much attention over the past twenty years due to its capacity in describing the natural models and phenomena, that is the reason why the number of publications on fractional optimal control problem (FOCPs) have grown rapidly, see [3, 8, 16, 22, 44] . However, in the existing literature, there are a few studies investigating the optimal control problems and control problems in general for fractional dynamic systems with uncertainty. The idea of combining fractional optimal control theory with fuzzy theory opened up many exciting applied problems in various areas of science and engineering. In fact, it is an attractive topic now and have achieved some considerable results. For instance, Sharma et. al. [40] proposed a scheme implemented two-layered fractional fuzzy logic controller for robotic manipulator, where the controller parameters of the proposed scheme are obtained with potential meta-heuristic technique named as cuckoo search algorithm. Next, Mazandarani et al. [28, 29] gave some necessary conditions for the optimality of fuzzy Bang-bang control and suboptimal control problems for fuzzy dynamical systems under granular differentiability. Later, Najariyan and Zhao [31] also discussed the granular fractional derivatives and fractional differential systems. Then, these concepts were applied to investigate the optimal conditions for a fuzzy fractional linear quadratic regulator problem under granular fractional derivatives. In addition, based on granular fractional differentiability, Son et al. [44] also proposed the optimal control problem for granular neutrosophic fractional differential equations with some applications in engineering. In the literature [33] , Pan and Das studied an application of fuzzy fractional control problems in designing fuzzy PID controllers for hybrid power system with renewable generation using chaotic PSO. Recently, Abbasi and Jalali [1] investigated the tracking control problem for fuzzy linear dynamical systems with applications in fuzzy tracking control problems of output of a two tanks in series system and landing jet aircraft. Mu\u00f1oz-V\u00e1zquez et.al. [48] also studied a model-free implementation and output feedback control for robust tracking of robotic manipulators based on the combination of fuzzy logic techniques for the control of uncertain dynamic systems, as well as the intrinsic properties of fractionalorder operators for modeling and control of complex engineering processes.",

            "text": "Epidemiology is an area concerned with the spread of disease and its effect on people. It relates to a range of science areas such as biology, sociology, philosophy, etc. and, in general, the aim is to prevent or control the spread of infection in health care facilities and the community. The modeling of infectious diseases is an effective tool which has been used to study the mechanisms by which diseases spread, to predict the future behavior of an outbreak and to evaluate strategies to control an epidemic. One of the earliest mathematical models to study infectious diseases, which is also one of the most well-known disease models, is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model proposed and studied by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927. Another early model is the Reed-Frost model developed in 1928 by Lowell Reed and Wade Hampton Frost, see [2] . Both of them describe the relationship between susceptible, infected and immune individuals in a population, however, the Kermack-McKendrick epidemic model was regarded as a successful model in predicting the behavior of outbreaks very similar to that observed in many recorded epidemics. Another famous epidemic model is the SEIR (Susceptibles, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model, an extension of the classical SIR. In this model, the added compartment E contains exposed persons which are infected but are not yet infectious. Moreover, individuals in all compartments of SEIR model are measured as fractions of the total population. Since the pioneering work in mathematical modeling of infectious diseases, many modified SIR & SEIR models have been developed and studied that allows us to study additional disease outbreak details, for example, the difference in disease spreads in different age groups or the difference in disease spreads in different environments. After predicting or approximating the behaviors of model's outbreak, there is a natural necessity that we need to control the epidemic, that is the motivation for the arising of many control and optimal control problems for epidemic models. Especially, the study of optimal control problem for epidemic disease models with non-integer order differential constraints is appreciated as the most effective extension. This comes from the considerable advantage of the fractional order derivative for the best modeling of biological models whose purpose is to get a deeper understanding of the complex behavioral patterns of various communicable diseases. Moreover, mathematical epidemic models with fractional order derivative provide a better fit to the real data instead of integer order models. Indeed, Para et. al. [34] proposed a fractional order model to investigate dynamics of the outbreaks of influenza A (H1N1), and demonstrated that the fractional order model provides a better agreement with real data than integer one. In [7] , Arenas et. al. constructed nonstandard finite difference schemes to obtain numerical solutions of the susceptible -infected (SI) and susceptible -infected -recovered (SIR) fractional -order epidemic models. A fractional order SIR epidemic model for dengue transmission between human and mosquito was proposed by Hamdan and Kilicman [17] to show the effect of fractional order derivative in representing the index of memory and eliminating the disease. In the field of engineering, Huo and Zhao [18] applied SIR model with fractional order derivative to study the stability of the equilibrium points of heterogeneous complex networks. For more details, see [14, 15, 19, 22] for therein. Although the issue of fractional optimal control of epidemic models has been investigated before, there still have many open questions remain. It is a fact that every real-world problem is inherently biased by uncertainty or there may be a lack of knowledge or incomplete information about variables and parameters. Hence, when we use fractional SIR & SEIR epidemic models to discuss real-world epidemic phenomena, it is a natural fact that we must accept to interpret and solve these problems in environments containing uncertainty and vagueness. An interesting fuzzy fractional problem related to SIR & SEIR epidemic models is the fuzzy fractional optimal control problem, in which we need to establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality or design the input controller for these models with incomplete initial data and uncertain parameters. However, there has been a few work done in the area of fractional optimal control problems for fuzzy fractional nonlinear differential equations, especially, fuzzy fractional optimal control problems modeled the SIR or SEIR epidemic models. Some pioneer works on fractional optimal control problem for fuzzy fractional differential systems can be mentioned such as the fuzzy time optimal problem, namely fuzzy Bang-bang control problem, for fuzzy differential equations discussed by Mazandarani and Zhao [28] or the sub-optimal control of fuzzy linear dynamical systems under granular differentiability in [29] . In a recent work, Son et al. [45] also presented an interesting result on an optimal problems governed by fractional linear differential equations in neutrosophic environment. However, it should be mentioned that most of these results are at the first stage and these considered model are just simple linear dynamical systems like linear differential systems. Although Najariyan and Zhao [31] introduced necessary conditions for the fuzzy fractional quadratic regulator problem of fuzzy fractional differential systems under granular Caputo fractional differentiability, all its applied models were in linear case. To the best of our knowledge, so far there has been no research in the area of optimal control for fuzzy fractional nonlinear differential equations governed by SIR or SEIR epidemic models. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the work on fractional optimal control problems for an abstract fuzzy fractional differential systems and apply the theoretical results to some epidemic disease model with the aim to approximate and control the behaviors of outbreak.",

Unfortunately, there were gaps because of more complicated operations on the vertical representation of fuzzy numbers. This leads to many computational paradoxes observed in fuzzy arithmetic. Hence, based on the idea of horizontal membership functions elaborated by Piegat and Landowski [35] , we introduce the concept of horizontal membership function or granular representation of fuzzy numbers Definition 2.3 (gr-representation). [27] Let u : [a, b] \u2286 R \u2192 [0, 1] be a fuzzy number. Then, horizontal membership function of u is defined as follows",

For the proof of Theorem 3.1, see Appendix. and how to control the spread of this infectious disease ? The formulation of mathematical modelings for COVID\u221219 is considered as an effective tool for not only studying the spread of infectious diseases but also predicting the outbreak and formulate policies to control the epidemics. In this example, we use fractional order SIR epidemic model to describe the structure of how the epidemic disease COVID\u221219. Next, we introduce the variables and some parameters used throughout this example. Firstly, we assume that the total population N (t) is divided into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected and Recovered individuals whose sizes are denoted by S(t), I(t) and R(t), respectively. Here, the compartment (S) is the group of people who are vulnerable to exposure with infectious people. The group of infectious population represents the infected people. They can pass the disease to susceptible people and can be recovered in a specific period. The compartment (R) is the group of recovered people who are assumed to get immunity so that they are not susceptible to the same illness anymore. The scheme of SIR model can be characterized in following diagram where the parameter c is used to evaluate how much the disease can be transmitted through exposure and r is used to express how much the disease can be recovered in a specific period. The parameters of the SIR model are given in Table 1 . The initial infectious populations I 0 and initial recovered populations R 0 of the SIR model are realistic data referred from two following open data-sets In reality, we cannot have exact data about the number of susceptible cases and infected cases because the number of infectious individuals measured at a certain time are only confirmed cases and there have a lot of infectious people in the testing time, that have not been confirmed. Moreover, the COVID\u221219 outbreak are now widespread around the world with a dramatic increase in the number of infectious cases and it experienced a considerable fluctuation between the data of two compartments (S) and (I). Therefore, it is a fact that we are difficult to get the exact and complete data of the epidemic and must admit that the number of susceptible cases in general is an uncertain quantity. Hence, it implies that every mathematical model modeling the outbreak of the COVID\u221219 should be an uncertain mathematical model. In this work, to dealing with the COVID\u221219's outbreak with the fuzziness in initial data, we use the mathematical SIR epidemic model with triangular fuzzy initial conditions. Furthermore, in order to express the non-local properties of the model, we propose a fractional model. Motivated by aforesaid, we introduce the following fuzzy fractional differential system for the SIR model",

Currently, the outbreak of acute pneumonia caused by the coronavirus has spread globally and has been raised to the highest level by WHO (see Figure 7 ). Recently, due to the global trend of the COVID\u221219 pandemic, there have been several work focusing on the mathematical modeling of the epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus such as Batista [9] , Ming et.al [30] or Nesteruk [32] . Their proposed model is the mathematical SIR model whose output is used to predict the number of susceptible, infectious and recovered individuals versus time of the total population. However, some recent research pointed out that the epidemic disease caused by coronavirus has a latent phase during which the individual is infected but not yet infectious. Thus, for the better modeling of the COVID\u221219's outbreak, we propose to add a variable E standing for a latent/exposed population and it allows to express the fact infected (but not yet infectious) individuals move from S to E and from E to I. Hence, the mathematical SIR model is then transformed into the mathematical SEIR model. The SEIR divides the total population into four compartments:",

In practical, we must accept to consider these initial values in approximated data.

In this example, we assume that the disease is in the outbreak time, where there has vague and incomplete information about the initial number of infected individuals that are unable to transmit the disease (E) and capable of spreading the disease (I). Indeed, people in the compartment (E) are someone who have had contact with COVID\u221219 infectious people or whose family members have been confirmed to be infectious by coronavirus and hence, it is difficult to determine exactly the number of people in this compartment. For convenience in calculation and prediction, we often assume that the initial number of exposed individuals E 0 is \"about 500000\". Thus, in this work, we propose to use the fuzzy triangular fuzzy numbers (499800, 500000, 500200) to represent for this uncertain quantity with the fluctuation of 200 individuals. Furthermore, the number of susceptible and recovered individuals are estimated in Table 3 . Figure 11 shows the fuzzy behavior of the fractional SEIR model with the fractional order \u03b2 = 0.7 and the initial data X 0 = S 0 E 0 I 0 R 0 t . We can observe that the number of susceptible individuals is predicted to be dramatic increases in the next 20 days, which means that the coronavirus will be widespread in all population. The second class of people, exposed individuals (E), is going to be sharply decreasing. For people in the compartment (I), it is predicted to reach a peak at t = 5 and then, it will be slightly decreasing. Although the number of recovered people is going to go up, the total population in general will experience a considerable decline during the period. Therefore, it implies a natural need to carry out some treatments to reduce the number of infected individuals. In particular, the quarantining susceptible people from infected individuals is considered an effective treatment to prevent people from COVID\u221219 infected.

The fuzziness and imprecise data in the considered models are handled by using the horizontal membership function approach. The main results concentrate on the solvability and fractional optimal control problem for an abstract class of fractional differential systems with uncertainty relating to some epidemic disease models. Here, the existence and uniqueness of fuzzy solution of the abstract fractional differential systems is carried out by using the virtue of contraction mapping principle. The fractional optimal control problem corresponding to this fractional dynamic systems is investigated with the aim to minimize the infected and susceptible populations and maximize the recovered population. A scheme to numerically solve the considered problem is also presented. We use the constructive approach, thus an modifications of Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector algorithm to characterize the numerical solution of the fuzzy fractional optimal control problem are proposed and directly applied to fractional SEIR model. Beside epidemic models, the proposed method could also be applied on some fractional model for the dynamics of data packet delays of switching stability in wireless sensor networks. Moreover, in network security issues, the infection of malware objects such as viruses, worms or trojans in networks are based on the transmission of electric-waves and signals between wireless sensor nodes. Computer virus propagation can be modeled by some fractional models. In the future work, we will formulate some fractional mathematical model of computer virus transmission with quarantine and uncertain initial data in wireless sensor networks via Caputo Atangana\u2212Baleanu fractional derivative.",

Firstly, let us define an operator F : C T \u2192 C T byBy means of Banach contraction principle, a function x \u2208 C T is the unique mild solution of the Cauchy problem (3) if and only if it is a fixed point of the solution operator F on a suitable closed, bounded, convex subset of the functional space C T . For this aim, let us denotewhere \u03bb > 0 is such that M1K1G(\u03bb,\u03b2) \u03b2 < 1 and r = M1( x0 \u03b2+L2T \u03b2 ) \u03b2\u2212M1L1G(\u03bb,\u03b2) > 0. Now, we proceed the proof by following steps:Step 1. The operator F is onto, i.e., F (\u2126 r ) \u2286 \u2126 r . Indeed, for each x \u2208 \u2126 r and t \u2208 [0, T ], we haveNext, by the definition of norm \u00b7 \u03bb and Lemma 2.3 in [24] , we haveNext, by dividing both sides of the inequality (25) by e \u03bbt , we obtainStep 2. The operator F : \u2126 r \u2192 \u2126 r is continuous. Indeed, let {x n } \u2282 \u2126 r be such that x n \u21d2 x \u2208 \u2126 r . Then,For each t \u2208 [0, T ], by employing hypotheses (HF1), (HF2), we haveIndeed, for each t \u2208 [0, T ], we haveThen, by dividing both sides by e \u03bbt and taking supremum for t \u2208 [0, T ], we obtainIt should be noted that for a big enough \u03bb, we have M1L1G(\u03bb,\u03b2) \u03b2 < 1. Thus, it implies that the operator F is a contraction. Finally, by using Banach contraction principle, we can conclude that F has a unique fixed point x * \u2208 \u2126 r that is unique mild solution of the Cauchy problem (3) .Realistic data about the number of infectious and recovered people ",
