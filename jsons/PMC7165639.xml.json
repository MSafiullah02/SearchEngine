However, in many studies faecal samples were not representative because they had been taken either by practicing veterinary surgeons or by the owners of the animals for routine diagnostic purposes only (Bergeland and Henry, 1982; Morin et al., 1983; Fitzgerald et al., 1988). In addition, most investigations concentrated on single pathogens only, leaving a lack of information about other relevant enteropathogens (Roepstorff and Jorsal, 1989; Driesen et al., 1993; Otten et al., 1996; Meyer et al., 1999). Occasionally, samples were investigated that had been collected from representative animals, however, their number was only small (Guscetti, 1991). Another concern is that faecal samples are not usually sent to the diagnostic laboratory directly, but the same sample is passed from one diagnostic unit to another for virological, bacteriological and parasitological examinations. Usually, the results from such studies leave the different survival rates of the pathogens unconsidered. Furthermore, much of the currently available data is based on results from more than 10 years ago and does not necessarily reflect the current epidemiological situation.",

In our investigation, 62.5 % of the farms were contaminated with I. suis. Otten et al. (1996) and Meyer et al. (1999) reported an I. suis prevalence of 100 % in Germany, Roberts and Walker (1982) of 78 % in Great Britain and Eyskers et al. (1994) one of 68 % in the Netherlands. Besides I. suis, Eimeria spp. were also found frequently in these pig production units. However, Eimeria spp. are shed more frequently from sows than from piglets (Lindsay et al., 1984; Nilsson et al., 1984). Stuart et al. (1982) postulate that older animals develop a lifelong immunity against I. suis. According to Tubbs (1986), passive immunity acquired via the colostrum protects piglets against Eimeria infections during the first weeks of life. In contrast, the lactogenic immunity against I. suis is insufficient. In addition, the short pre\u2010patency (5\u20136 days) compared to that of Eimeria spp. and the short sporulation time of I. suis cause higher concentrations of infectious I. suis stages in the litters (Tubbs, 1986). These considerations are confirmed by the high prevalence of I. suis (20.9 %) and the low prevalence of Eimeria spp. (0.7 %) detected in the present study. The highest prevalences for I. suis were observed in the second and third weeks of life. These data correspond to, and thus confirm, findings from earlier investigations (Henriksen and Christensen, 1989; Henriksen, 1991). In general I. suis appears to be the most prevalent enteropathogen of young piglets, as was also shown by studies in the USA (Bergeland and Henry, 1982; Lindsay et al., 1984; Biehl and Hoefling, 1986; Fitzgerald et al., 1988), Canada (Morin et al., 1983), Australia (Driesen et al., 1993), Great Britain (Roberts and Walker, 1982), Sweden (Nilsson, 1988), Italy (Trotti et al., 1987) and Germany (Otten et al., 1996; Meyer et al., 1999). Guscetti (1991) examined both healthy piglets and those with diarrhoea for the shedding of I. suis, and found a difference in the prevalence of 61 % to 4.3 %, respectively. These findings underline the importance of I. suis as a cause of diarrhoea.",

This result is in accordance with previously published data (Bergeland and Henry, 1982; Trotti et al., 1987; Sanford, 1987; Villacorta et al., 1991; Otten et al., 1996). Higher prevalences have only been reported if older animals were investigated (Sanford, 1987; Otten et al., 1996). Oocysts of C. parvum are frequently isolated from healthy piglets (Villacorta et al., 1991; Otten et al., 1996) and C. parvum is therefore not regarded as an obligate pathogen for piglets (Sanford, 1987). Nor does Balantidium coli appear to be an aetiologically relevant pathogen, although in comparison to the results gained in the present study (prevalence 0.7 %) higher prevalences have been published (5\u201315 %) (Inderm\u00fchle, 1978; Morris et al., 1984; Otten et al., 1996). Apart from protozoal infections it is remarkable that helminth infections were completely absent in the present study. Particularly, S. ransomi had been reported in previous years to be a common parasite in young piglets in Germany (H\u00f6rchner et al., 1980; Muss and Hasslinger, 1989; Otten et al., 1996). The weaners, at least, were old enough also to shed eggs of other nematodes such as Ascaris suum or Oesophagostomum spp. Clearly more data are needed on a broader scale to gain evidence as to whether the situation has changed generally, possibly due to improved hygiene standards, or not.",

It is an interesting finding that the numbers found in this study and those of other investigators from Germany are very low in comparison with studies from other countries (Morin et al., 1983; Fitzgerald et al., 1988; Biermann et al., 1989a, 1989b; 15Herbst et al., 1989; Otten et al., 1996). However, the finding that rotavirus infections were increasing during the third and fourth week of life was also observed in other studies (Nilsson et al., 1984; Fitzgerald et al., 1988; Svensmark et al., 1989). In contrast, infections with coronaviruses were detected particularly in weaned piglets.

            "text": "The results concerning infections with ETEC are comparable with those of the coronavirus infections. In particular, ETEC were shed by weaned piglets preferentially (42.7 %). In suckling piglets, the prevalences were lower and they decreased from 9.5 to 5.6 % between the first and third weeks of life. To our knowledge, a similar low level prevalence (7.4 %) has so far only been reported by Guscetti (1991). In most of the studies published previously the prevalences in suckling piglets ranged between 30 and 50 % (Bergeland and Henry, 1982; Morin et al., 1983; Biehl and Hoefling, 1986; Evans et al., 1986; Nakazawa et al., 1987; Fitzgerald et al., 1988; Driesen et al., 1993). In piglets with diarrhoea, isolation rates even reached 88.6 % (Nagy et al., 1990). Since most of these high prevalences were measured more than 10 years ago, the low prevalence detected in our study is presumably due to the increasing use of ETEC vaccines in pregnant sows during the last years. In agreement with the results of Wilson and Francis (1986), ST\u2010I\u2010positive ETEC were found more frequently than LT\u2010I\u2010positive strains in suckling piglets. However, the finding that LT\u2010I\u2010positive ETEC strains are highly prevalent in weaned piglets has not been observed previously (Moon et al., 1986; Nakazawa et al., 1987; Ojeniyi et al., 1992; Wray et al., 1993). These results warrant further investigations, because the rearing practice has changed to early weaning at 3\u20135 weeks of life and this may have contributed to the higher infection rate with these particular subsets of ETEC.",

            "text": "It is noticeable that a relatively large proportion of the animals (57.6 %) was found to be negative for all of the enteropathogens we looked for, although more than 60 % of the production units were contaminated with coccidia, coronaviruses, or ETEC and although only piglets with diarrhoea were investigated. Since the procedures of sampling, transport to the diagnostic laboratory and analyses of the samples were to a large extent optimized, one must assume that either a large proportion of the cases was caused by non\u2010infectious factors or that currently unknown pathogens were involved. However, the latter is unlikely, since a much broader spectrum of microbiological pathogens is detectable with the diagnostic techniques applied. It was also surprising that in contrast to the situation in calves with diarrhoea (Baljer et al., 1987) only 9.1 % of the 42.4 % positive faecal samples harboured more than one pathogen.",

Presumably, the lactogenic transfer of maternal immunity against these pathogens to the litters is very efficient. However, under this protective shield of maternal immunity suckling piglets are not able to build up a sufficiently active immunity, which would be protective after weaning. This protection gap after weaning, in connection with an increased susceptibility to infections caused by the stress of weaning, seems to be a major cause of the economic losses from diarrhoea during the raising of piglets.",
