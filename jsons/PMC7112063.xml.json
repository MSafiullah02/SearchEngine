            "text": "The mechanisms that influence the transport of viruses are important for management of natural systems and freshwater resources. These may include human pathogens such as those introduced by fecal matter, but, more importantly, bacteriophage which serve to regulate bacterial populations (O'Brien et al., 2017). Bacteriophage alter biogeochemical cycles through lysis of bacterial cells (D\u00edaz-Mu\u00f1oz and Koskella, 2014; Koskella and Brockhurst, 2014) and impact eukaryotes that depend on bacterial populations, thus having a significant impact on the greater ecosystem. The distribution and residence time of viruses is affected by the chemistry of the water, e.g., dissolved organic matter, metals, and contaminants, but also the suspended materials, such as particulate organic matter (POM) and suspended sediment, primarily clays, which serve as substrate and habitat for biofilm-producing bacteria (Alimova et al., 2006; Alimova et al., 2009). In fact, sediment-bearing biofilms have been shown to sequester virus particles in wetlands where they are subsequently concentrated and subject to re-release (Flood and Ashbolt, 2000). Furthermore, bacteriophages are utilized as subsurface tracers and indicators for a variety of environmental applications (Ghanem et al., 2018; Keswick et al., 1982; Redman et al., 1997) and, therefore, their interaction with sediments may affect their quantification in hydrological experiments.",

In aquatic systems, the length of time in which a virus can interact with potential hosts is largely controlled by sinking rates (Fuhrman, 1999). These rates are strongly influenced by aggregation with suspended particles. Sediments are known to influence virus transport and survival in porous media by controlling the potential for viruses to contaminate groundwater (Jin and Flury, 2002; Chu et al., 2000) and to promote lysis of bacteria in soils (Kimura et al., 2008). The mineralogy and size of suspended sediments affects the extent to which viruses will aggregate and sorb to sediments (Chu et al., 2000; Jin and Flury, 2002; McGechan and Lewis, 2002; Syngouna and Chrysikopoulos, 2015). With a few recent exceptions, enveloped viruses (Block et al., 2016; Block et al., 2014), have been largely omitted from studies of virus-sediment interaction, aggregation, and viability. Enveloped viruses possess different structural properties from non-enveloped viruses and include important plant and animal pathogens such as herpesvirus, coronavirus and Influenza A and B, all of which are found in natural and wastewaters (Batik et al., 1980; Gundy et al., 2008; Rosenberg et al., 1980; Sharp et al., 1975; Stallknecht et al., 1990a; Stallknecht et al., 1990b).",

For non-enveloped viruses, the surface charge is determined by the protonation/deprotonation of amino acids in the capsid (Elimelech et al., 1995). However, for enveloped virions, surface charge is determined by envelope proteins and lipids. The colloidal interaction between virus particles and the small fraction of suspended sediments can be described by DLVO theory (Derjaguin and Landau, 1941; Verwey and Overbeek, 1948), in which the potential between colloidal particles is the sum of the attractive van der Waals potential and the Coulomb potential (repulsive for like-charged particles and attractive for oppositely-charged particles). DLVO theory has been extended to include hydrophobic forces (van Oss, 1993; van Oss et al., 1990).",

The cystoviridae are the only phage family with an outer bi-lipid envelope. \u03c66 is a dsRNA virus whose host cell is Pseudomonas phaseolicola, a common plant pathogen. \u03c66 consists of an icosahedral nucleocapsid surrounded by a bi-lipid envelope and is therefore employed as a model for virus emergence in evolutionary studies and for human pathogens such as coronavirus (Dennehy, 2017; Mindich, 2004).

A 1 mm diameter aperture positioned in front of the collection fiber limited data collection to transmitted light while blocking scattered light. A magnetic stirrer was employed to prevent settling of the suspended colloidal aggregates. The distance between the cuvette and aperture was 5 cm, limiting the collection solid angle to 0.00003 sr and thus restricting the intensity of forward scattered light incident on the collection fiber (Katz et al., 2013). For time-resolved measurements, each spectrum was integrated for 250 ms using a high-speed data acquisition mode which allowed rapid collection and transfer of many spectra (3600 spectra for the typical 900 s experiment) to a PC with no dead-time between spectra acquisitions.

Therefore, for the heteroaggregation turbidity experiments, the \u03c66 concentration was adjusted to have a lower turbidity than the turbidity at the lowest sediment concentration.

This resulted in a further 50% dilution of the cation concentration (5 mM KH2PO4 and 0.25 mM MgSO4). Due to both the larger volume of the sediment primary particles (~0.2 \u03bcm) and higher refractive index. Refractive indices of the three sediment types are (geometric mean of the three axes): goethite: n = 2.18; illite: n = 1.58; kaolinite: n = 1.56; montmorillonite: n = 1.55 (Deer et al., 1992; Shannon et al., 2002; Weidler and Friedrich, 2007) compared to \u03c66 particles (80 nm), the sediment primary particles have a higher scattering cross-section than the virions. Therefore, the heteroaggregation experiments were performed using a higher concentration of viral particles than sediments. The sediment concentrations were adjusted to have a turbidity of ~0.6 (after 2\u00d7 dilution by addition of virus suspension) at 750 nm \u2013 a wavelength in which light extinction losses are primarily due to scattering rather than absorption. The concentrations were chosen so that the total volume of the scatterers was <0.1% of suspension volume, thus staying in the single scattering regime and keeping the incidence of multiple scattering small (Katz et al., 2013; Wind and Szymanski, 2002; Xu and Sun, 2010), while still providing a reasonable signal-to-noise level. The sediment and virus concentrations after the 2\u00d7 dilution are summarized in Table 1\n.",

In the \u03c66-kaolinite and \u03c66-illite aggregates, the virions in the pellets, i.e. aggregated virions, show an appreciable loss in infectivity (14% and 27% of original virus populations remained viable for kaolinite and illite, respectively), while virions that did not aggregate remained close to 100% viable.

The viral particle diameters are similar to the 55 nm diameter of the nucleocapsid rather than the 80 nm diameter of the intact virions and the virions appear to be distinctly non-circular. The morphologic changes indicate that the sediments partially disassembled the viral envelope \u2013 a process likely responsible for the reduced rate of virus infectivity.",

Negatively charged sediments aggregated with \u03c66 at a faster rate than positively charged sediments, indicating that the interaction is not electrostatic, but hydrophobic in nature. Because K, the rate constant, is independent of concentration, the relative rates for aggregation at low turbidity are a good predictor of rates at higher concentrations.",

At higher sediment concentrations, we expect an even larger viral fraction to aggregate, resulting in higher deposition rates. Nevertheless, at the low concentrations of our experiments, heteroaggregated viruses experienced a loss of infectivity. Despite the fragility of the viral envelope, a large number of virions remained viable, indicating that small-sized heteroaggregates may pose an infection risk. While non-aggregated virions in the \u03c66 \u2013 goethite, \u03c66 \u2013kaolinite and \u03c66 \u2013 illite suspensions remained near 100% viable, in the \u03c66 \u2013 montmorillonite suspensions, a substantial fraction (35%) of the non-aggregated \u03c66 also lost viability. TEM analysis revealed that the observed reduction in infectivity is likely due to partial disassembly of the viral envelope after aggregation. In conclusion, it is expected that viral disassembly and loss of infectivity is likely to be exacerbated with increased contact between virions and sediments which occurs within larger aggregates.",

Our results suggest that soils containing clay minerals, and in particular, montmorillonite, may potentially serve to inactivate viruses possessing a rigid lipid envelopes during colloidal transport. However, our results also show that even in the case of viruses that are not inactivated by association with a solid phase, colloidal sediments could facilitate the transport of viruses into aquifers as small heteroaggregates. Furthermore, because multiple virions aggregate with colloidal sediment even in dilute concentrations, forming heteroaggregates in the colloidal size range, this interaction must be considered in conjunction with specific infectivity (Ghanem et al., 2018) when phages are used in tracer experiments.",
