            "text": "Seasonal influenza A generally causes a yearly epidemic with variable prevalence based on vaccine efficacy and antigenic drift. Antigenic drift occurs in seasonal influenza due to minor mutations in the viral hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. Antigenic shift occurs because of the ability of the virus to infect multiple animals, especially birds, and the ability of the segmented genome to undergo reassortment, mixing different proteins from different viral strains (Table 1\n). Novel influenza strains are antigenically distinct because of complete exchange of gene segments encoding the H or NA proteins, introducing H and NA variants that have not previously circulated in humans; thus, reassortant viruses have the ability to cause pandemics because of minimal preexisting population immunity. Avian influenza viruses can be passed to humans directly through close contact, or indirectly through another animal host. Because these viruses are adapted to birds, they usually have limited ability to replicate in humans, restricting person-to-person transmission. However, this can be circumvented by either mutation or reassortment with a human virus, as in the pandemic 2009 H1N1, which was a reassortment between avian, human, and swine influenza viruses.1, 2 Initially, reports of novel influenza A viruses centered on cases of H5N1. H5N1 human cases have occurred predominantly in Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and the Middle East; however, H5N1 has been detected in birds across Eurasia, Indonesia, and North Africa. Newly emerging avian influenza strains, including H7N9 and H10N8, have been identified in patients with poultry exposure in China. Seasonal outbreaks of H7N9 in humans have occurred since 2013, with a recent spike in cases in China.3 Most cases have been reported in adults.4 Influenza A H5N1 causes more severe disease and higher mortality in children, whereas person-to-person transmission is more common with H7N9, with nearly half of pediatric cases occurring in secondary clusters.5 These novel influenza strains retain their preference for avian receptors and are not well adapted for human-to-human transmission.6 Thus, pediatric cases are less common, likely because of lower rates of poultry exposure in children. Nonetheless, these viruses have been adapted in a controlled setting to be transmissible among mammals7; therefore, sustained human-to-human transmission could be possible, placing children at risk.",

Three patients suffered from rapidly progressive, fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome with multiorgan system failure; 2 were known to have recent poultry exposure. Fever and cough are common symptoms,13 and similar to H5N1, laboratory findings included cytopenia, elevated liver function tests, and elevated creatinine kinase.13, 14 In 2013, a fatal case of novel H10N8 was reported in a patient with recent poultry market exposure in China.15 Retrospective testing demonstrated that this was a newly emerged virus with no prior evidence of infection in poultry workers.16\n",

Influenza C has 9 viral proteins in contrast with the 10 and 11 viral proteins of influenza A and B, respectively. Unlike influenza A and B, it does not contain the NA outer membrane protein. This difference contributes to unique disease characteristics and important considerations with respect to antiviral treatment. Similar to influenza B, influenza C does not undergo reassortment and antigenic shift, which is in contrast to influenza A. Influenza C does exhibit antigenic drift, and multiple variants can co-circulate (see Table 1). Data suggest that the virus circulates globally, and like other respiratory viruses, infection occurs early in life.1 Most children infected are less than 6 years old.24 Influenza C has been rarely identified as a cause of medically attended illness in adults.25 The prevalence of influenza C is typically less than influenza A, but it can approach influenza B for some years.26 Although overall rates are low, less than 1% of all respiratory specimens in one study,24 epidemics do occur in conjunction with replacement of the dominant antigenic group.27, 28 Influenza C circulates primarily during the winter to early summer.24 Recent studies using molecular detection have suggested that influenza C is more frequent in children than previously recognized.24, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31\n",

A novel Betacoronavirus, subsequently termed Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), was identified. Although most of the cases were detected in Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, imported cases to the United States were described.37 The virus was closely related to bat CoVs.38 However, camels were later identified as an intermediary host when zoonotic transmissions occurred,39 and MERS-CoV seroprevalence was significantly higher among persons with camel exposure.40 Person-to-person transmission did occur, which led to secondary hospital outbreaks.41 Although initial reports primarily occurred in adults, likely related to zoonotic and occupational exposures, pediatric cases developed in household contacts.42\n",

Although the younger child died of respiratory failure, the older child had a relatively uncomplicated hospital course.

The identification and emergence of novel respiratory viruses are important for pediatricians and infectious diseases clinicians. Viruses that were previously difficult to culture can now be rapidly identified using molecular diagnostics and sequencing, and these techniques are highly useful for detecting outbreaks. In addition, the ongoing evolution of viruses and ability to mutate allows for species-to-species transmission of novel viruses. Practitioners should remain on high alert for emerging viruses in cases whereby a cause cannot be identified for a clinical syndrome or if the clinical syndrome is more severe than expected for the identified pathogen. Travel and animal exposure history are important to maintain a high index of suspicion, and rapid institution of appropriate isolation precautions is crucial to prevent person-to-person transmission (see Table 2).",
