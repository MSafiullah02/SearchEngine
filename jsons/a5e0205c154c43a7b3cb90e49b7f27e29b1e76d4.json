Residents comprise a large portion of the workforce in many academic centers and have become critical in the front-line response for COVID-19 patients. As hospitals experience surges in admissions, residents in many disciplines, including urology, have been asked to function outside their specialty training to join COVID-19 treatment units. As the pandemic unfolds, urology residents will face challenges regarding personal safety and well-being, disruptions in their urology training, and relationship strain. Given the uncertain duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the possibility of multiple waves of infection,1 long-term action plans can help prepare training programs and residents during these unprecedented times. In this commentary, we discuss different elements affecting urology resident training during the COVID-19 pandemic and strategies to minimize the impact of these factors. We recognize urology programs are heterogeneously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; these suggestions should be adapted to programs' individual needs and capabilities.",

These PPE lessons will be especially important for the PGY-1 class of 2020, as well as some early medical school graduates,4 as any errors in technique or judgment can have significant consequences.",

Access to COVID-19 testing for both HCW and patients is variable, and testing policies differ by region and institution. It is critical that residents who experience symptoms suggestive of a COVID-19 infection selfquarantine, only return to work after cessation of symptoms, and obtain testing if available. Until access to testing increases, clinicians should assume patients requiring an operation have COVID-19 until proven otherwise and take the proper precautions. Urology residents should exercise precautions in the operating room, as bag mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and laparoscopic surgery are aerosolgenerating procedures that carry an increased risk of airborne viral transmission. Resident surgeons should leave the room during intubation when possible, wear proper PPE, avoid excessive use of electrocautery, and suction surgical smoke liberally.5 Hospitals should develop protocols for testing patients going to the operating room (OR) based on testing availability and speed of result acquisition.5 COVID-related precautions should be integrated into standard surgical time outs to ensure that all OR staff are properly protected.",

Teams should consider virtual handoffs and assigning individual residents to round on patients, rather than traditional team rounds. 7 We encourage urology residents to refer non-urgent consults directly to telemedicine outpatient appointments to minimize patient exposure to hospitals and clinics.6",

By participating in these virtual visits, residents can review charts and engage in patient counseling under the supervision of an attending urologist. A number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility and success of telemedicine clinics for urologic conditions, both in pediatrics and adults.13, 14 To our knowledge, no studies have examined the incorporation of telemedicine into urology residency curricula.

For example, the University of California at San Francisco founded the Urology Collaborative Online Video Didactics (COViD), a series of daily online lectures given by urologic educators across the country covering a variety of topics.27 Participants have the opportunity to engage in discussion and ask questions, thereby receiving state-of-the-art education and gaining exposure to how urology is practiced outside their institutions.27 These digital lectures also promote networking and resident camaraderie. Urology residents working on a flexible clinical schedule should maintain a daily log of their educational activities that can be monitored by their program directors. Ultimately, virtual platforms could lead to the implementation of a standardized national urology resident curriculum with interactive modules, where trainees have access to expert faculty in all areas of urology, regardless of their program size, location, or faculty composition.",

Therefore, urology training programs must respond in innovative and dynamic ways. It is critical to ensure safety via adequate PPE and COVID-19 testing and provide adequate mental health assessment for urology trainees. While this pandemic has altered clinical duties, urology residents are encouraged to continue ongoing academic endeavors through digital medical education and research. Ultimately, the challenges created by COVID-19 pandemic will be overcome through novel solutions that can empower the next-generation of urologists.",
