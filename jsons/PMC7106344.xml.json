            "text": "Vietnamese pig production is rapidly increasing due to a human population and economy that are growing resulting in increased consumer demands for pork meat. In Vietnam, the per capita consumption of pork is expected to increase from 37.8 kg in 2012 to 48.7 kg by 2020 and pig production is projected to increase from 31.2 million pigs in 2012 to 34.8 million in 2020 (Stuart, 2012). In consequence, Vietnam is facing huge challenges managing large volumes of pig manure in an environmental sustainable manner (Huynh et al., 2006). Through surface run-off and seepage nitrate and other nutrients originating from manure may contaminate water sources including aquifers and wells used for extracting drinking water (Burton and Turner, 2003). Pig and other livestock manure may also contain a range of different zoonotic pathogenic bacteria, e.g. Salmonella spp., E. coli, Campylobacter spp., Yersinia spp.; parasites, e.g. Ascaris spp., Taenia spp. and protozoan parasites; and vira, e.g. Hepatitis E and exotic viruses like Nipah, that can cause disease in humans through direct exposure or comsumption of contaminated water or food (Guan and Holley, 2003, Herremans et al., 2007, Spencer and Guan, 2004). Pig manure is commonly used as crop fertilizer and Salmonella spp. and other pathogens frequently found in pig wastes (Hutchison et al., 2005a) may then contaminate the environment and crops (Baloda et al., 2001).",

Solid pig manure is normally mixed with straw, ash or lime, then covered by mud or plastic and stored for a few months before use as fertilizer (Tuan et al., 2006, Vu et al., 2007). In farms integrating pig and fish production, both solid and liquid manure is discharged directly into fish ponds to fertilize growth of plankton and other organisms that is eaten by the fish (Vu et al., 2007). Large-scale farms store slurry mainly in lagoons but may also operate biogas digesters, or occasionally discharge the slurry into aquatic recipients.",

The digestion is typically done at mesophilic (35\u201340 \u00b0C) or at thermophilic temperatures (50\u201355 \u00b0C) when systems are heated. Mesophilic digestion is associated with limited pathogen reduction which is in contrast to the thermophilic conditions where most pathogens are inactivated (Sari et al., 2011, Teodorita et al., 2008). In Vietnam, the use of biogas digesters to manage and treat livestock manure has grown fast since 2003 where main efforts were initiated to promote the technology (Khai and Luong, 2010). By the end of 2012, a total of 125,000 biogas units were built in Vietnam with support from the government as well as non-governmental organizations. Several designs of biogas digesters, e.g. fixed dome and plastic tube biogas digesters, have been developed addressing the needs of different livestock farming systems with the vast majority of biogas systems being small-scale digesters receiving pig manure from up to 20 fattening pigs (Biogas Program, 2012, Khai and Luong, 2010).",

In Vietnam, biogas systems not only provide gas for cooking but also improve the household environment by reducing problems with odor and flies (Huong et al., 2014). Traditionally, Vietnamese households have used solid animal manure to fertilize crops in fields and gardens. With many households now operating biogas digesters, they have shifted to the use of biogas effluent replacing raw or composted manure as a fertilizer of crops and vegetable (Chau, 1988, Francese et al., 2000); fish ponds and even as an animal food additive (Ngoc and Nhai, 2008, Tuyen et al., 2011). When building new houses, many Vietnamese pig farmers have installed new flush toilets that are connected to the biogas digesters (Huong et al., 2014). This is of concern since biogas effluent will most likely contain not only pathogens originating from pigs, but also a range of human pathogens that may be transmitted through contaminated water and foods when using biogas effluent as crop fertilizer or discharged indiscrinately into the external environment.",

This is in agreement with reported results from other studies on the bacterial reduction capacity of biogas digesters in Vietnam (Kobayashi et al., 2003, Son et al., 2008) as well as other parts of the world (Bagge et al., 2005, Mass\u00e9 et al., 2011, Pourcher et al., 2007, Ram et al., 2009) The prevalence of Salmonella was 63.2% in raw pig slurry and was reduced to 32.6% in effluent samples. Salmonella spp. is commonly found in pig manure and may therefore be found in composted manure or other manure by-products (L\u00e9tourneau et al., 2010). A study in Vietnam on raw septic sludge and mesophillic treated septic sludge found that 70% and 60% of samples were positive for Salmonella spp., respectively (Yen-Phi et al., 2010) which suggests that human excreta is a likely source of Salmonella spp. when used in biogas digesters. Pourcher et al. (2007) showed in France that Salmonella was detected in raw pig manure (60%) and in treated manure after biogas digestion (20%).",

According to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) part 503 rule (USEPA, 2003), Class A biosolids must contain less than 3 MPN/4 g of Samonella or less than 1000 MPN/g of E. coli before land application where as Class B biosolids must contain less than a geometric mean of two million fecal coliforms per g when applied to land. In Vietnam, there does not seem to exist any specific regulations on the hygienic quality of manure or biogas effluent to be applied to agricultural fields. However, regulations from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment states that water used to irrigate vegetables or plants eaten raw must contain less than 200 \nE.\n \ncoli\n cfu/100 mL (QCVN, 2011). Regulations of biosecurity at pig farms in Vietnam states that wastewater, including liquid slurry, discharged to the external environment should not contain any Salmonella in 50 mL wastewater and less than 500 MPN fecal coliforms per 100 mL (QCVN, 2010). In our study, the mean Salmonella and E. coli concentrations in effluent samples were 103\n cfu/25 g and 4.3 cfu log10/g in the summer season, respectively and 102\n cfu/25 g and 4.8 cfu log10/g in the winter season, respectively. Thus, according to the EPA rules our biogas effluent should be classified as biosolids Class B with a range of restrictions on use, e.g. it cannot be used to fertilize crops for animal and human consumption. Also, the effluent does not fulfill the stipulated national rules for discharge into the environment. It should be noted that a main barrier for farmer's use of biogas liquid effluent and subsequent discharge into the environment is lack of adequate technologies to remove, transport and apply the effluent.",

            "text": "Anaerobic digestion in biogas systems is a potential sustainable technology to manage manure from small-scale pig farmers in Vietnam, but our results document that Salmonella spp. and other pathogens are likely to be present in effluent and subsequent transferred to fertilized crops, i.e. rice, maize, peanuts, potatoes and fruit trees, but also to vegetables consumed raw, i.e. coriander, salad, carrots and cucumber. In addition, the indiscriminate discharge of effluent by the farmers to the external environment, e.g. canals and household perimeter, may pollute aquatic recipients as well as drinking water sources, e.g. household wells. Low temperatures enhance survival of pathogens and mesophilic digestion is not a sufficient hygienic treatment method of biowaste due to possible survival of Salmonella and other pathogens (Gerba and Smith, 2005, Nicholson et al., 2005). Even at thermophillic conditions, Salmonella has been found in 55% of treated septic sludge samples as compared with 67% of septic sludge before treatment (Sahlstr\u00f6m et al., 2004). Salmonella spp. have been reported to survive for an extended period of time in soil and water (Bicudo and Goyal, 2003, Guan and Holley, 2003) and can survive for several months in stored slurry (Hutchison et al., 2005b). Also, Salmonella spp. is relatively persistent in soil and can persist for up to 100 days in slurry applied to grass (Mawdsley et al., 1995), e.g. Salmonella Typhimurium was found to persist up to 231 days in soils amended with contaminated composts (Islam et al., 2004). On vegetables, Salmonella Typhimurium was detected for up to 63 days and 231 days on lettuce and parsley, respectively (Islam et al., 2004). Fresh produce has been implicated in several foodborne disease outbreaks involving Salmonella spp. (CDC, 2013, Harris et al., 2003) and recently a multistate outbreak of human Salmonella serotype 1,4,[5],12:i:- infections linked to alfalfa sprouts was reported (CDC, 2011). Information about similar disease outbreaks is not available for Vietnam. The use of human excreta in biogas digesters represents an increased risk of transfer of human pathogens when biogas effluent is used as crop fertilizer or discharged into the environment. Although we did only analyze for Salmonella spp., it is likely that other human viral and parasite pathogens will survive the anaerobic digestion and be present in biogas effluent. In particular parasites, e.g. protozoans and helminthes, are of concern as they are much more resistant to environmental stress compared to bacterial pathogens. Our microbiological findings and the use of biogas effluent to fertilize vegetables and other plants consumed raw suggests that such use practices represent actual food safety hazards. Further quantitative microbial risk assessment studies are needed to determine associated human health risk.",

            "text": "Guidelines from the Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) (Biogas Program, 2012) suggest that the biogas digester should be fed at a ratio between manure and water of 1:3, but most farms did not meet that criteria, and in consequence, the manure was too diluted and the HRT low which partly explain the limited bacterial reduction. We also found that the farmer's house, the pig pen as well as cages for other animals were usually located closely together on limited land in densely populated areas which increases the risks for transmission of zoonotic pathogens. Farmers often raised high numbers of pigs in a limited area (Vu et al., 2007) which is different compared to Europe where the number of pigs per m2 is regulated (Burton and Turner, 2003). The farmers reported a broad use of disinfectants to clean pig pens and household toilets. However, it is currently unknown to what extent such use of disinfectants affects the microbial populations responsible for the methane production as well as the survival of animal and human pathogens present. Temperature in the biogas digester tank ranged from 18 to 23 \u00b0C (winter season) and 28 to 31 \u00b0C (summer season) which is low compared with biogas systems in Europe where digestion is often done in heated systems either at mesophilic (35\u201340 \u00b0C) or thermophilic temperatures (50\u201355 \u00b0C) (European Bioplastic, 2010, Teodorita et al., 2008). With the current practices of placing the biogas digester underground it will not be possible to increase temperature. However, there exist low-cost biogas digesters made of polyethylene, e.g. some are operating in southern Vietnam, which are placed on the ground (An, 2002). It remains to be determined if such exposure to sunlight will increase temperatures to levels, thermophilic conditions, needed to inactivate pathogens. Also, as winters are quite cold in northern Vietnam it is unlikely any thermophilic conditions can be achieved during the winter. Although solar panel heated biogas digesters have been developed such technology are not yet available for small-scale farmers at acceptable costs. Increased hydraulic retention time (HRT) will lead to increased pathogen die-off. However, although use of less water for cleaning and cooling pigs will increase HRT, it will not be possible to obtain any significant increased in HRT in the existing biogas digesters.",

As we found pH in the biogas digesters to range from 6.0 to 8.0, only limited reduction of Salmonella spp. can be expected. The NH3 concentration in our study ranged from 0.14 to 355.29 mg/L. The formation of ammonia depends on the temperature and pH in the digestate, i.e. the higher the temperature and pH, the higher the formation will be of ammonia (Mata-Alvarez, 2003). The inactivating effect of ammonia has been shown for bacteria (Ottoson et al., 2008, Vinner\u00e5s et al., 2008), viruses (Emmoth et al., 2011), protozoa (Jenkins et al., 1998) and helminth eggs (Pecson and Nelson, 2005). Ammonia inactivates pathogens when a sufficient high NH3concentration is achieved (EU, 2011). Addition of 0.5% ammonia (4950 mg/L) to human excreata composted at 40 \u00b0C provided a 5 log10 reduction of Enterococcus, thermotolerant coliform, Salmonella and coliphages (Marcus, 2012). Vinner\u00e5s et al. (2003) reported that the addition of urea at a dosage of 30 g ammonia per kilogram (26,970 mg/L) to composted fecal waste resulted in more than 6 log10 reduction of E. coli, Enterococcus spp., and Salmonella spp. within three weeks and no viable Ascaris suum eggs were found after 50 days of treatment. Emmoth et al. (2011) showed that adding 0.5% (w/w) ammonia (4950 mg/L) to poultry by-product waste before use as fertilizer or as substrate in a biogas digester yielded a 1-log reduction (D value) within 3.0 h of enveloped and naked single-stranded RNA viruses such as coronavirus. In this study, we found a median NH3 concentration of 3.25 mg/L and only on two occasions were concentrations of NH3 above 100 mg/L recorded. With the low temperatures and pH values found in the Vietnamese biogas digesters in both winter and summer season, the NH3 concentration will not reach levels needed for any major inactivation of bacteria, vira and parasite pathogens.",

Generally when farmers had to build new housing facilities and at the same time wanted to install a biogas digester, then the toilet was connected to the biogas digester. However, households already having toilets (flush system) connected to a septic tank did not connect such toilets to the biogas digester. Effluent was often discharged to the environment because farmers were not aware of the nutrient content and fertilizer value of biogas effluent and therefore mainly saw the effluent as a waste product. One reason stated by the farmers for discharging the biogas effluent to the environment was that equipment for transport of the effluent to the field is lacking and the distance from househoulds to the field is quite far. Thus, there is a need to find ways and technologies to transport the liquid effluent to the field.",

Since we selected only one Salmonella isolate for serotyping from each sample it is likely that additional Salmonella serovars were present. All of isolated Salmonella serovars are potential pathogens and can cause gastroenteritis in humans. The most frequent isolated Salmonella serovars was Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- which is a monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium (EFSA, 2010, Soyer et al., 2009). In addition, Salmonella Weltevreden, Salmonella Rissen and Salmonella Albany were identified each with a prevalence of approximately 6%. Salmonella Typhimurium is a common cause of salmonellosis worldwide and has been reported to be the main species implicated in food contamination (NARMS, 2011). Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- is currently considered an emerging epidemic serovar owing to the rapid increase in the prevalence of human outbreaks worldwide over a relatively short period of time (Agasan et al., 2002, Hopkins et al., 2010, Mossong et al., 2007, Switt et al., 2009, Tavechio et al., 2004) and to the increase in trade and consumption of pigs and pork products (Barco et al., 2012, Echeita et al., 1999, Hauser et al., 2010). Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- is therefore of increasing public health concern (EFSA, 2010). In Vietnam, Salmonella spp. has been found in 49% of pig carcasses (Nguyen, 2007) and in 40\u201370% of raw pork meat (Thai et al., 2012, Van et al., 2007). Studies in Vietnam have reported that the most common Salmonella serovars found in human and animal feces, carcasses and meat were Salmonella Typhimurium, Salmonella Anatum, Salmonella Emek and Salmonella Rissen (Thai et al., 2012, Vo et al., 2006).",

Our Salmonella isolates showed some resistance to ciprofloxacin (23.9%) which is often the first drug of choice for treatment of human salmonellosis (Giraud et al., 2006), including in Vietnam (Kinh, 2010). Resistance to multiple antimicrobials was further studied among Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella 4,[5],12:i:- (Table 4), which both are considered foodborne pathogens (Soyer et al., 2009). These multiple resistance patterns are similar to those reported in Salmonella Typhimurium isolated from pork meat collected from markets and supermakets in southern Vietnam (Van et al., 2007) and from pig carcasses in northern Vietnam (Ellerbroek et al., 2010, Thai et al., 2012).",
