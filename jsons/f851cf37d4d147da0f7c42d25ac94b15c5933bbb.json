Participants are recruited by several strategies, including: engaging peer-educators at schools and venues where young people congregate; social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and hook up apps; word-of-mouth, and by an artificial intelligence chatbot named \"Amanda Selfie\" conceived as a transgender woman. It is the first Latin America transgender chatbot. Available 24/7 on Facebook Messenger, it emulates chatbased conversations on sensitive subjects: sex, STIs, PrEP and combination prevention. It can identify those in higher risk for HIV, and schedule PrEP arm are PrEP-eligible but chose  not to use prophylaxis and receive other HIV combination  prevention (counseling, condoms, lubricant, douche, and  HIV self-test-HIVST) . After PrEP initiation, participants are assigned a study peer-navigator and are monitored by the health team (Table 1) . These activities take place in person, via smartphone, and on WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook messages. All cities where PrEP1519 takes place have adopted quarantine and social isolation guidelines, including reductions in public transportation and suspension of many non-essential health services. Therefore, the difficulty for individuals, and marginalized groups in particular, to reach services is much harder now. The PrEP1519 study decided to continue its work during to the pandemic, and was able to adapt quickly to the new situation due to the social media and telemonitoring infrastructure that was set up to reach AKP beforehand. In this paper, we aim to describe the strategies adopted by PrEP1519-sites of Salvador and S\u00e3o Paulo to continue to provide HIV and sexual and reproductive health services during quarantine periods to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Salvador and S\u00e3o Paulo now provides additional telehealth as the default care provision platforms, such as digital participant recruitment and peer support and navigation via smartphone text messages and online social media (Instagram and Facebook), streamlined PrEP initiation and retention procedures. The strategies of navigation online were more intensified as adolescents are eager to have a conversation and ask questions on how to persist with their PrEP use under quarantine. Providers still offer in person visits at their discretion, and reserve care for individuals who do not have respiratory symptoms (Table 1) .",

So far, participants in need of support, have switched to the e-service modality without If participant's choice is a face-to-face appointment, we conduct HIV rapid tests, collect a blood sample to STI serological tests such as HIV, syphilis, viral hepatitis and HTLV, and safety tests for PrEP use that assess kidney and liver function, collect DBS for future for future PK sub-studies; and dispensation of PrEP for 1 or 2 months. Site staff conducts a phone call the day before their appointment to confirm their intention to attend the visit, and evaluates if s/he lives with someone at a higher risk of COVID-19 (e.g. the elderly or people with comorbidities) and offers guidance on COVID-19 protection for in person appointments. Also to inquire about COVID-19 symptoms: fever (> 37.7 \u00b0C), cough, runny nose, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, muscle pain, or anosmia. If any of these symptoms are reported, his/her visit is postponed and s/he receives guidance on COVID-19 management and resources, and the clinical team evaluates the possibility of sending PrEP and HIVST to their preferred addresses No worries with temperature measurements of participants on arrival The temperature of all participants is measured on arrival constraints. Furthermore, mental health support short videos developed by communication team are offered.",
