Starting concentrations were diluted in ratios of 1:2. The combination synergistically inhibited SARS-CoV-induced CPE in Caco2 and CL14 cells (representative photographs shown in Fig. 1) as well as production of infectious virus (Table 2\n). EC50, EC75, and EC95 of ribavirin, IFN-\u03b2 or their combination in infected human intestinal cell lines Caco2 and CL-14 were determined by measurement of infectious virus titre. For example, in Caco2 cells infected with SARS-CoV FFM1 strain (MOI 0.01), ribavirin concentrations inhibiting virus production in combination with IFN-\u03b2 were at least 10-fold lower when compared with cultures receiving single treatment with ribavirin. Inhibitory concentrations of IFN-\u03b2 were 50- to 2000-fold decreased in combination relative to single treatment with IFN-\u03b2. Calculation of CIs revealed highly synergistic antiviral effects of the drug combination. In FFM1-infected Caco2 cells the CI values were 0.45 \u00b1 0.07 at the EC50, 0.3 \u00b1 0.05 at the EC75, and 0.21 \u00b1 0.05 at the EC90.

We observed about 90% viral replication inhibition at concentrations up to 24 \u03bcg/ml ribavirin which is at reasonable therapeutical plasma levels after an intravenous dose of 1000 mg ribavirin [2]. This may be insufficient to improve clinical symptoms. In concordance, randomised clinical trials showed low dose (400\u2013600 mg/day) ribavirin to be ineffective [15]. On the other hand, the most recently published study reported that ribavirin reduced the viral load in 5 of the 8 patients [16]. Moreover, this study suggested that the peak inflammatory cytokine (IL-6 and IL-8) levels concurred with or after the peak viral load and preceded or concurred with the maximum pulmonary infiltrates. Thus, it is probable that viral replication leads to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines that, together with other factors, contribute to disease progression. These clinical findings together with the observation of antiviral activity in different SARS-CoV-infected cell lines encourage the testing of treatment strategies using ribavirin in combination with other antiviral agents such as IFNs to increase inhibitory effects on virus replication and subsequently minimised immunopathological damages.",

Tan et al. [9] reported that ribavirin in combination with IFN-\u03b2 did not demonstrate observable synergistic effects whereas Chen et al. [5] showed highly synergistic activity. However, both studies reported solely on CPE formation in Vero cells. Our results demonstrate that both drugs act highly synergistically in combination on formation of CPE as well as on production of infectious virus titres in two human cell lines. Since antiviral drugs were added after virus adsorption, the results show that IFN-\u03b2 in combination with ribavirin may be highly effective not only as prophylactic agent but also for the treatment of already infected SARS patients.",
