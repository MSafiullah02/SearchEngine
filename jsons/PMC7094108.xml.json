Of course, natural and political barriers can alter the structure of the contact networks, by possibly reducing interactions between infected and susceptible individuals, and thus delaying the course of the epidemics. While this effect may explain pandemic waves in wide areas (such as the US), its influence is much weaker when narrower areas are considered (e.g., at city level). Moreover, possible effects of containment/mitigation strategies may not be disregarded (Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007, Hatchett et al., 2007), especially for more recent outbreaks. Other explanations for pandemic waves should be sought in the genetic variation of the influenza virus (Castillo-Chavez et al., 1989, Andreasen et al., 1997, Boni et al., 2004), i.e., the appearance of new strains that could reduce or eliminate acquired immunity. However, the presence of more than one strain in the same pandemic outbreak has not been observed yet. Exogenous time changes in transmission rates, such as seasonal forcing, is a further candidate explanation (Colizza et al., 2006, Colizza et al., 2007). While the role of seasonal forcing as a trigger of steady oscillations for endemic diseases, as measles, is well established (Fine and Clarkson, 1982), and factors underlying the winter seasonality of influenza have been suggested (Hemmes et al., 1960), the phenomenon can hardly be taken as a robust explanation of waves of pandemic flu (at least at local scale).",

            "text": "Alternative explanations can be advanced in a coinfection scenario (May and Nowak, 1995, Adler and Losada, 2002). For instance, can other acute respiratory infections (ARI), such as Rhinovirus and Adenovirus, be responsible for increasing transmissibility (e.g., by coughing, sneezing, running nose) of pandemic influenza? If this is the case, coinfection with ARI could also be responsible for epidemic waves, for instance when the dynamics of the influenza pandemic and the ARI are not synchronized. Recent works support this hypothesis. In fact, the presence of respiratory pathologies not directly linked to the pandemic virus has been detected in most of past pandemic episodes. In particular, Rhinovirus and Adenovirus were detected in patients during past pandemic events (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005, Brundage, 2006). Moreover, superspreading episodes (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005), potentially linked to coinfection events, were detected in all these cases (Brundage, 2006). Superspreading events in SARS might also be caused by coinfection with other respiratory viruses (Bassetti et al., 2005a). The mechanism was also identified as responsible for increased transmission of Staphylococcus aureus (Bassetti et al., 2005b). Additional (though indirect) support to the coinfection scenario can be drawn from a recently advanced proposal (Edwards et al., 2004), according to which alteration of the lung airway surface properties by inhaled nontoxic aerosols is an effective strategy to contain the amount of exhaled bioaerosol, thus mitigating the spread of airborne infectious diseases.",

Individuals susceptible to both diseases (class SS) can acquire influenza and progress to class IS at the per-capita rate \u03b2IS+\u03c1II or acquire ARI and move to class SI at the per-capita rate \u03b1(SI+II+RI), where \u03b2 is the influenza transmission rate per person per unit of time (i.e., the average number of effective contacts per unit time) for the individuals affected by influenza only, \u03c1 is the influenza transmission rate per person per unit of time for the coinfected individuals, and \u03b1 is the ARI transmission rate per person per unit of time. Individuals susceptible to influenza and affected by ARI (class SI) progress to class II at the per-capita rate \u03b2IS+\u03c1II (the same rate of class SS since we assume changes in transmissibility and not in susceptibility) or move to class SS at the per-capita rate \u03b4, where 1/\u03b4 is the average duration of infectivity of individuals affected by ARI. Individuals affected only by influenza (class IS) recover from influenza at the per-capita rate \u03b3 or move to class II at the per-capita rate \u03b1(SI+II+RI), where 1/\u03b3 is the average duration of infectivity of individuals affected by influenza. Coinfected individuals (class II) recover from influenza at the rate \u03b3 or move to class IS at rate \u03b4. Individuals recovered from influenza and susceptible to ARI (class RS) move to class RI at the rate \u03b1(SI+II+RI). Finally, individuals recovered from influenza and affected by ARI (class RI) move to class RS at the rate \u03b4. The full transmission model is described by the following system of ordinary differential equations:(1)S\u02d9S(t)=-\u03b1[SI(t)+II(t)+RI(t)]SS(t)+\u03b4SI(t)S\u02d9S(t)=-[\u03b2IS(t)+\u03c1II(t)]SS(t)S\u02d9I(t)=+\u03b1[SI(t)+II(t)+RI(t)]SS(t)-\u03b4SI(t)S\u02d9I(t)=-[\u03b2IS(t)+\u03c1II(t)]SI(t)I\u02d9S(t)=-\u03b1[SI(t)+II(t)+RI(t)]IS(t)+\u03b4II(t)I\u02d9S(t)=+[\u03b2IS(t)+\u03c1II(t)]SS(t)-\u03b3IS(t)I\u02d9I(t)=+\u03b1[SI(t)+II(t)+RI(t)]IS(t)-\u03b4II(t)I\u02d9I(t)=+[\u03b2IS(t)+\u03c1II(t)]SI(t)-\u03b3II(t)R\u02d9S(t)=-\u03b1[SI(t)+II(t)+RI(t)]RS(t)+\u03b4RI(t)R\u02d9S(t)=+\u03b3IS(t)R\u02d9I(t)=+\u03b1[SI(t)+II(t)+RI(t)]RS(t)-\u03b4RI(t)R\u02d9I(t)=+\u03b3II(t).To assume that coinfection leads to increased transmissibility means considering \u03c1>\u03b2 in system (1).

On the other hand, when the basic reproduction number of ARI \u03b1/\u03b4 is above 1, then a substantial part of the population can be infected with ARI at the onset of the influenza epidemics.

The quantities A(J) and B(J) are reproduction numbers themselves: A(J) characterizes the situation where the susceptible pool is fully composed by individuals free from ARI, whereas B(J) characterizes the situation where the susceptible pool is fully composed by individuals infected by ARI. Both A(J) and B(J) are increasing in J. Moreover B(J)>A(J) holds for all J and as J increases the composition of the susceptible pool is modified by increasing the percentage of susceptible with ARI.
