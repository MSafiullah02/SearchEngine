            "text": "The first ancient pandemic well back around 165 A. D. known as the Antonine Plague generally referred as the Plague of Galen, was a pandemic that affected Asia Minor, Egypt, Greece, and Italy and is thought to have been either Smallpox or Measles, though the true cause is still unknown and have killed over approximately 5 million people [3]. Then arose the Plague of Justinian around 541-542 A. D. which is assumed to have killed perhaps half the population of Europe, was an outbreak of the bubonic plague that afflicted the Byzantine Empire and Mediterranean port cities, killing up to 25 million people in its year long reign of terror [4]. From 1346 to 1353 A. D. an outbreak of the Plague called as the Black Death ravaged Europe, Africa, and Asia, with an estimated death toll between 75 and 200 million people. This is assumed to have originated in Asia, the Plague traversed to continents via the fleas living on the rats that so frequently lived aboard merchant ships [5]. Like the first and second pandemics, the Third Cholera Pandemic originated in India, spreading from the Ganges River Delta before making disaster through Asia, Europe, North America and Africa and ending the lives of over a million people. Originally the \u201cAsiatic Flu\u201d or \u201cRussian Flu\u201d (scientifically said to be FLU PANDEMIC (1889-1890)) as it was called, this strain was thought to be an outbreak of the Influenza A virus subtype H2N2, though recent discoveries have instead found the cause to be the Influenza A virus subtype H3N8 [6]. The first cases were observed in May 1889 in three separate and distant locations, Bukhara in Central Asia (Turkestan), Athabasca in north-western Canada, and Greenland. Rapid population growth of the 19th century, specifically in urban areas, only helped the flu spread, and before long the outbreak had spread across the globe. The Sixth Cholera Pandemic originated in India where it killed over 800,000, before spreading to the Middle East, North Africa, Eastern Europe and Russia. The Sixth Cholera Pandemic was also the source of the last American outbreak of Cholera (1910\u20131911) 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Between 1918 and 1920 a disturbingly deadly outbreak of influenza (Flu pandemic) tore across the globe, infecting over a third of the world's population and ending the lives of 20 \u2013 50 million people. Of the 500 million people infected in the 1918 pandemic, the mortality rate was estimated at 10% to 20%, with up to 25 million deaths in the first 25 weeks alone [13]. Asian Flu was a pandemic outbreak of Influenza A of the H2N2 subtype, that originated in China in 1956 and lasted until 1958 [13]. In its two-year spree, Asian Flu travelled from the Chinese province of Guizhou to Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United States and the death toll was approximately 2 millions. A category 2 Flu pandemic sometimes referred to as \u201cthe Hong Kong Flu,\u201d the 1968 flu pandemic was caused by the H3N2 strain of the Influenza A virus, a genetic offshoot of the H2N2 subtype. From the first reported case on July 13, 1968 in Hong Kong, it took only 17 days before outbreaks of the virus were reported in Singapore and Vietnam, and within three months had spread to The Philippines, India, Australia, Europe, and the United States. First identified in Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976, HIV/AIDS has truly proven itself as a global pandemic, killing more than 36 million people since 1981. Currently there are between 31 and 35 million people living with HIV, the vast majority of those are in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 5% of the population is infected, roughly 21 million people. As awareness has grown, new treatments have been developed that make HIV far more manageable, and many of those infected go on to lead productive lives. Between 2005 and 2012 the annual global deaths from HIV/AIDS dropped from 2.2 million to 1.6 million 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.",

            "text": "The history of human coronaviruses began in 1965 when Tyrrell and Bynoe1 found that they could passage a virus named B814. It was found in human embryonic tracheal organ cultures obtained from the respiratory tract of an adult with a common cold [15]. Human coronaviruses, first characterized in the 1960s, are responsible for a substantial proportion of upper respiratory tract infections in children. Since 2003, at least 5 new human coronaviruses have been identified, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which caused significant morbidity and mortality. NL63, representing a group of newly identified group I coronaviruses that includes NL and the New Haven coronavirus, has been identified worldwide. These viruses are associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease and are likely common human pathogens [16]. The cause of a very new, severe acute respiratory syndrome, called SARS, emerged in 2002\u20132003 as a coronavirus from southern China and spread throughout the world with quantifiable speed. The SARS epidemic put the animal coronaviruses in the spotlight. In the last twenty years, several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded. Most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths, and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths and still causes as sporadic cases 17, 18, 19. On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a \"COVID-19,\" which is the acronym of \"coronavirus disease 2019\" [20]. Coronavirus is the name given to group of viruses that infect mammals and birds. The name Corona is derived from latin word meaning Crown that refers to its characteristic appearance where its surface is covered in the form of club shaped protein spikes [21]. The host and reservoir of coronavirus is depicted in Figure 1\n.",

This family of viruses seems to expand continuously according to Scientists and SARS-CoV-2 alternatively known as COVID-19 also belongs to this family of viruses. There is a probability that some of these viruses might have been missed by the scientists and hence there is still a lot to explore about COVID-19 and the response mechanism of the human immune system. By now 40 coronaviruses have got their names approved as per the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses. The numbers of identified coronaviruses have reached to seven including the current COVID 19. Most of these viruses seem to affect the animals. Four among these seven viruses are acquired by community and transmit through population continually for long period of time. On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are recent outbreaks and are associated with very high mortality rates. Shereen et al. [22] states in addition to the above three, H5N1 influenza A and H1N1 2009 cause acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) all leading to pulmonary failure and ultimate fatality. All corona viruses start in animals and pass on to humans through mutation, recombination and adaptation. Shereen et al. [22] supports that the originating source of COVD-19 is bats but the intermediate source before transmission to humans is not yet identified.",

            "text": "Many animal coronaviruses infect animals during a particular season. The reason why these animal coronaviruses do not cause symptoms in their host reservoir is because they continuously co-evolve and adapt over a long period of time with their reservoir host. The symptoms are mild even if they are shown. Symptoms in species vary like in birds it causes upper respiratory tract infections while in cows or pigs it results in Diarrhea. In humans it causes respiratory tract infections that could lead to common cold. The high infection rate, recombination rate and mutation rate of these animal coronaviruses increase the probability of mutant's ability to transmit into another host. It has been speculated that the severity of disease is significantly very high between the new host and the coronavirus at the new round of adaption. It is not yet proved but speculated that the new host will be able to fight the virus effectively only after a long period of adaption and co-evolution hence leading to milder symptoms. The seven human coronaviruses are transitioned into humans through other animals after originating in animals like bats and rodents. The four human coronaviruses including hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-229E cause mild common cold like symptoms. Although they cause infections across all age groups throughout the year but the rates are higher in winters and early spring. They cause multiple re-infections throughout human lifespan. These viruses are transmitted to human beings when they come in close in contact with the host. These viruses during their incubation period in human beings develop or even mutate for further transmission to other human beings. Earlier form of Coronaviruses includes SARS and MERS that were lethal but were not able to Transmit in Exponential manner like COVID 19.",

[22] states that the subgroups of coronaviruses family include alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3) and delta (\u03b4) coronavirus and COVID 19 belongs to the \u03b2 group of coronaviruses.Its infection rate is significantly higher than the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) hence raising the concern of international Public Health Emergency. It enters into the host cells through a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein. This protein undergoes substantial structural change in order to form fusion between the membranes of the virus and the host cell. The protein subunit S1 binds with the host cell receptor. Prefusion trimer is destabilized by the receptor binder resulting in transition to subunit S2. The down (receptor inaccessible) conformation state is more stable than the up (receptor accessible) conformation state. S protein pays an indispensable function and the characterization the Prefusion structure provides vital information which is used in the design and development of the vaccine.",

The position of the Receptor Binding Domains (RBD) in their respective down conformations is one of the larger differences between these two structures. The SARS-CoV RBD packs tightly against the N-terminal domain of the neighboring protomer, while COVID 19 RBD is angled closer to the central cavity of the trimer. COVID 19 S and SARS-CoV S, reflect the high structural homology between the two proteins despite the difference in the alignment. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the same functional host cell receptor shared between COVID 19 S and SARS-CoV S. The apparent ease with which COVID 19 spreads from human to human is mainly because of its very high affinity for human ACE2. Shereen et al. [22] supports that the transmission rate of SARS-CoV 2 is higher than the SRAS CoV owing to the events of genetic recombination in the RBD domain. Shereen et al. [22] states that a clinically approved antivirus is not yet available to fight against the COVID 19.The rapid spreading of COVID 19 indicates the urgent need for coronavirus vaccines. The information available on COVID 19 atomic-level structure will facilitate the additional protein-engineering efforts which could result in the improvement of antigenicity and protein expression for the development of vaccine. The structural data will also provide information on occurrence of the mutations when virus undergoes genetic drift; define whether residues map to known antibody epitopes sites for other coronavirus spike proteins.

            "text": "Pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China on 31 December 2019 [20]. Because the first cases of the CoVID-19 disease were linked to direct exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market of Wuhan, Republic of China, the animal-to-human transmission was presumed as the main mechanism. Nevertheless, subsequent cases were not associated with this exposure mechanism. Therefore, it was concluded that the virus could also be transmitted from human-to-human, and symptomatic people are the most frequent source of COVID-19 spread. The possibility of transmission before symptoms develop seems to be infrequent, although it cannot be excluded. Moreover, there are suggestions that individuals who remain asymptomatic could transmit the virus. This data suggests that the use of isolation is the best way to contain this epidemic [25]. Based on data from the first cases in Wuhan and investigations conducted by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs, the incubation time could be generally within 3 to 7 days and up to 2 weeks as the longest time from infection to symptoms was 12.5 days (95% confidence interval, 9.2 to 18) [26] . This data also showed that this novel epidemic doubled about every seven days, whereas the basic reproduction number (R0) is 2.2. In other words, on average, each patient transmits the infection to an additional 2.2 individuals. Of note, estimations of the R0 of the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2002-2003 were approximately 3 [27]. Study suggests that people may acquire the coronavirus through the air and after touching contaminated objects. Scientists discovered the virus is detectable for up to three hours in aerosols, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel [28]. An analysis of publicly available data on infections from the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that causes the respiratory illness, COVID-19 yielded an estimate of 5.1 days for the median disease incubation period, according to a new study led by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health [29]. This median time from exposure to onset of symptoms suggests that the 14-day quarantine period used by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for individuals with likely exposure to the coronavirus is reasonable. The analysis suggests that about 97.5 percent of people who develop symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection will do so within 11.5 days of exposure. Lauer et al. estimated that for every 10,000 individuals quarantined for 14 days, only about 101 would develop symptoms after being released from quarantine [29].",

Simulations have been carried out for each model to depict local and global stability. Some examples are mentioned below for simulating the models either for Ro < 1or forRo > 1.\nExample 1: The local stability of the infection-free equilibrium point has been numerically simulated and depicted in Figures 7\n(a), 9(a) and 11(a) for stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively and the corresponding simulated data for this unsuccessful attack are listed in Table 4\n, 7 and 10 respectively. The initial point and the parametric values along with basic reproduction number (Ro)are shown in Table 5\n, 8 and 11 for stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The value of Rofor all the three stages is less than one. It is clearly observed that the infection-free equilibrium point turns out to be stable for all the stages.\nExample 2: The local stability of the endemic equilibrium point has been numerically simulated and depicted in Figures 8\n(a), 10(a) and 12(a) for stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively and the corresponding simulated data for this successful attack are listed in Table 6\n, 9 and 12 respectively. The initial point and the parametric values along with basic reproduction number (Ro)are shown in Table 5, 8\nand 11\nfor stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The value of Rofor all the three stages is greater than one. It is clearly observed that the endemic equilibrium point turns out to be stable for all the stages.\nExample 3: The behaviour of system 1, 3 and 5 are studied by considering quarantine population \u2013 recovered population plane and Figure 7(b), 9(b) and 11(b) for stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively reflects that recovered population is directly proportionate with quarantine population for Ro < 1 . Even for Ro > 1, the same relationship is achieved in Figure 8(b)(i), 10(b)(i) and 12(b)(i) for stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively and the same with respect to time is shown with 3-dimentional graph in Figure 8(b)(ii), 10(b)(ii) and 12(b)(ii) for stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively.\nExample 4: The behaviour of system (1), (3) and (5) are also studied by considering home isolation population \u2013 recovered population plane and Figures 7(c), 9(c) and 11(c) for stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively reflects that recovered population is not much affected or depends on home isolation population for Ro < 1 . Even for Ro > 1, the same relationship is achieved in Figures 8(c), 10(c) and 12(c) for stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively.\nExample 5: The behaviour of system (1), (3) and (5) are also studied by considering infectious population \u2013 quarantine population plane and Figure 7(d), 9(d) and 11(d) for stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively reflects that infectious population gradually becomes quarantine population and is under control. Whereas forRo > 1, Figures 8(d), 10(d) and 12(d) for stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively depicts that a large number of populations are infectious as well as quarantined.\nExample 6: The global stability of the endemic equilibrium point forRo > 1 is shown in Figures 8(e), 10(e) and 12(e) for stage 1, 2 and 3 respectively. It shows the plane formed by the susceptible population and infectious population. It can be clearly seen in all above said Figures that the trajectories are seen to be asymptotically stable at endemic equilibrium point which is unique and globally stable.\n",

From the numerical simulations it is very clear that the more we have home isolation (or complete lockdown or social distancing), the less we have the chances to be infected and the disease to be transmitted in the population, which is very evident from Figures 7(c), 8(c), 9(c),10(c),11(c), 12(c). The general home isolation for our results is approximately 11.85 days. From the simulation results it is also evident from Figures 8(b)(i), 9(b), 10(b)(i)&(ii), 11(b), 12(b)(i) &(ii) that COVID-19 positive population when are subjected to hospital quarantine, the transmission of the disease is reduced and the rate of recovery also increases. Till date when no vaccine or treatment is available for COVID-19, then from our developed models, it is well established that social distancing and hospital quarantine (for positive cases) is the only best treatment.",
