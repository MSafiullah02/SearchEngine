            "text": "Can uncertainty about credit availability trigger a slowdown in real activity? This question is answered by using a novel method to identify shocks to uncertainty in access to credit. Time-variation in uncertainty about credit availability is estimated using particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We extract shocks to timevarying credit uncertainty and decompose it into two parts: the first captures the \"pure\" effect of a shock to the second moment; the second captures total effects of uncertainty including effects on the first moment. Using state-dependent local projections, we find that the \"pure\" effect by itself generates a sharp slowdown in real activity and the effects are largely countercyclical. We feed the estimated shocks into a flexible price real business cycle model with a collateral constraint and show that when the collateral constraint binds, an uncertainty shock about credit access is recessionary leading to a simultaneous decline in consumption, investment, and output.

More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered financial market uncertainty -both through changes in measures such as the VIX or uncertainty about access to liquidity. 1 Concurrently, the role of credit markets in shaping business cycle dynamics has gained traction with many authors documenting a link between credit build up in periods of expansion and the subsequent crash in recessions; e.g., Mian and Sufi (2018) , Jord\u00e0, Schularick, and Taylor (2013) . Our article proposes a novel description of the link between credit markets and uncertainty shocks. We exploit the dynamics of credit expansion and contraction to explicitly pin down the role of uncertainty shocks in credit markets to quantify how a change in the second moment transmits into the real economy.",

This is done by separating the identified shock into two components -one that captures the independent or 'pure' effect of a change in the second moment and the other capturing additional first-moment effects that are associated with effects of an uncertainty shock to credit access. To quantify the impact of shocks to uncertainty about access to credit, the extracted shocks are used to construct impulse responses using the local projections method (Jord\u00e0, 2005) . Impulse responses are constructed for two scenarios: one in a linear model with no distinction between recessions and expansions; the other in a state-dependent version of local projections that allows for differences between recessions and expansions.",

These studies quantify the effects of a mean-preserving spread on business cycle dynamics. Uncertainty in these papers, however, stems from the time-varying volatility in exogenous shocks to aggregate productivity, aggregate demand, fiscal policy or borrowing costs. One of the challenges in the literature is understanding the origin and propagation of shocks to uncertainty.",

Recently, Ludvigson, Ma, and Ng (forthcoming) find that sharply higher macroeconomic uncertainty in recessions is often an endogenous response to output shocks, while uncertainty about financial markets is a likely source of output fluctuations. Instead of imposing identifying restrictions and shock based restrictions, we overcome these challenges by building the measure of uncertainty shock from timevariation in the volatility of credit expansion and contraction.",

However, a drawback of PMMH is that it is sensitive to the size of the variance of the log of the estimated likelihood, so that for many problems it is computationally demanding to ensure that variance of the log of the estimated likelihood is around 1; e.g. Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde et al. (7). The correlated PMMH approach helps the chain to mix even if highly variable estimates of the likelihood are used; this means that generally far fewer particles are required at every iteration of the MCMC than for the standard PMMH.

(2004) is used to sample the latent log-volatility; Algorithm 3 in the appendix C describes the correlated particle filter algorithm to obtain the unbiased estimate of the likelihood.",

This simple assumption generates important implications by introducing a distortion through the intratemporal optimization condition of the households in the optimal labor-leisure trade-off. In the absence of sticky prices, this wedge can generate a simultaneous decline across variables in the model economy.

The baseline model presented in sections 5.1 through 5.4 corresponds to \u03bd = 0. The orange line in panel 1 in Figure 10 shows that the consumption of rule-of-thumb households fall disproportionately in response to an uncertainty shock in access to credit. Since hours supplied by the non-Ricardian households remain unchanged, hours supplied by the optimizing/Ricardian households contract more than the baseline (the yellow line in panel 2 of Figure 10 ). The blue line in panel 3 of Figure 10 shows that in equilibrium, aggregate output falls by less compared to the baseline in orange in panel 2 of Figure 10 . In this extension the smaller decline in output relative to the baseline is driven by a smaller decline in the aggregate supply in hours. Figure 10 : Impulse responses for a 1 standard deviation shock to uncertainty \u03b7 * t in the extended DSGE model with rule-of-thumb agents. An uncertainty shock to credit access leads to a disproportionately bigger decline in consumption for the rule-of-thumb agents. For the Ricardian households, the decline in consumption is smaller and decline in hours is bigger compared to baseline. Aggregate output falls by more in the baseline scenario.",

It interprets this stochastic volatility in credit growth as uncertainty about access to credit. The results suggest that unforeseen changes in uncertainty about credit access can trigger a sharp slowdown in real activity. Furthermore, it shows that these effects are largely countercyclical, with bigger effects during recessions. A flexible-price model with collateral constraints is presented to provide intuition for the transmission mechanism, and the effects of an uncertainty shock to credit availability is examined in this framework. When the collateral constraint binds, an uncertainty shock about credit availability can generate a simultaneous decline in consumption, investment and output, a finding that previous work on uncertainty shocks without credit constraints has been unable to produce.",
