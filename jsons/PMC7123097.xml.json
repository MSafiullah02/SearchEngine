Thus, managing the air quality and ensuring it free from airborne infectious agents are of utmost importance in such environments. Deployment of filtration equipment (proper air conditioning systems) can reduce airborne concentrations of fungi significantly. It is worthwhile mentioning that airborne bacteria could cause severe infections during surgery. It has been observed that reduction of airborne bacteria in operating rooms is directly linked with the substantial decrease in contamination of wounds.(ii)In India, there is an urgent need to develop tools to accurately measure bioaerosols, to quickly identify them in order to have a baseline information and establish a link to infections to make appropriate strategy to mitigate and control these especially in the sensitive indoor environments (hospitals, school, shopping malls etc.) and to the influence on climate.\n",

            "text": "Biologically produced (from plants/animals) aerosols are widely referred to as bioaerosols (also referred to as primary biological aerosol particles: PBAPs) (Despr\u00e9s et al. 2012; Fu et al. 2008; Miyakawa et al. 2015; P\u00f6schl et al. 2010). Improper sanitation, waste-disposal practices and biomass burning may also result into generation of huge amounts of microbes in the air (Taha et al. 2007). In the atmosphere, they are ubiquitous as bacteria, viruses, fungal spores, bio-debris and pollens (Fi\u0161ar et al. 1990; Lau et al. 2006; Prussin et al. 2015; Reponen et al. 2007; Sesartic and Dallafior 2011). The size of different types of bioaerosols varies over a large range (Reponen et al. 2001). For example, viruses are generally of the size of less than 300 nm, bacteria are in the range of 0.3\u20138 \u03bcm, fungal spores in the range of 1\u201330 \u03bcm and size of pollens are greater than 17 \u03bcm (Gregory 1973; Stanley and Linskins 1974). The size of bio-debris (fragments from plants/animals) may vary from sub-micron to coarser fraction (Graham et al. 2003a, b). It is important to mention here that bioaerosols can adsorb onto existing particles in the ambient atmosphere, and thus, their aerodynamic diameter and residence time can be influenced by the physical characteristics of the suspended particulates (Donaldson et al. 2001; Shaffer and Lighthart 1997). The contribution of bioaerosols in total particulate matter has been assessed previously from different environmental conditions reporting 28% over remote continental, 22% in populated continental and 10% in remote maritime environments (Matthias-Maser et al. 2000). A recent study (Zhu et al. 2016) has studied quantitatively the contribution of PBAP during daytime and night-time in a temperate coniferous forest in Japan (at Wakayama). They have measured biomarkers of PBAP (fungal spores tracers: arabitol, mannitol and trehalose) through solvent extraction followed by derivatization approach. The contribution of fungal spores in organic carbon (OC) was found to be relatively high in their study during night-time (45%) as compared to that in daytime (22%), and they have attributed this observation to nocturnal sporulation under near-saturated RH condition. Thus, the contribution of bioaerosols to OC can be quite significant over/near the forest/polluted region (Huffman et al. 2012, 2013).The spatial distribution of Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks in India is shown in Fig. 5.1. They are expected to representing background source of bioaerosols in Indian region and particularly over the Indo-Gangetic Plain.\n",

            "text": "It has been widely realized that bioaerosols play a very important role in climate change through participation in carbon cycle of the ecosystem and holding potential cloud condensation nuclei as well as ice-nucleation activity (Bauer et al. 2003; Fr\u00f6hlich-Nowoisky et al. 2009, 2016; Garcia et al. 2012; Hawkes et al. 2011). In addition, they are widely studied also because of their many allergenic effects on the human health (Annadotter et al. 2005; Balasubramanian et al. 2012; Clark et al. 1983; Domanska and Stroszejn-Mrowca 1994; Semple et al. 2010; Xue et al. 2016). Human exposure to bioaerosols through physical contact or inhalation may lead to adverse health effects like asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), whooping cough, and sick building syndrome (GBD 2015). Study to understand their occurrence and effects in indoor and outdoor environments is one of the major thirst areas of research (Iossifova et al. 2007; Kildeso et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2006). However, despite being a very important area of research, bioaerosols have been studied little less over Indian region (Ansari et al. 2015; Kumar and Attri 2016; Kumar et al. 2011; Mamta et al. 2015). Recently, there are studies emerging out from southern part of India documenting the number and mass distribution of fluorescent biological aerosol particles (FBAP), a lower limit of PBAP (Valsan et al. 2015, 2016).",

Epidemiological investigations have suggested a modest effect of endotoxin exposure on morbidity pertaining to asthma (Michel et al. 1996; Salonen et al. 2016). Furthermore, acute exposure of endotoxins to humans can cause blood/lung inflammatory responses (Michel et al. 1992). Towards this, it is worthwhile mentioning that a recent study over eastern part of India (states of Odisha), reported PM1-bound indoor levels of endotoxin (100\u2013160 EU/m3; EU: endotoxin units) from biofuel burning (Padhi et al. 2016).

Their presence in atmosphere is plausibly a function of dispersal from a site of colonization, survival and/or growth. The health effects of bioaerosols include allergies, infectious diseases and acute toxic effects. Furthermore, cancer in conjunction with the threat of bioterrorism and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) has increased public awareness on the importance of study on bioaerosols. There are numerous technical methods for sampling bioaerosols and can be employed depending on the sensitivity of the method and the concentration of micro-organisms. There have been difficulties and challenges in standardization of sampling methods. The major problems include establishment of a causal relationship arising due to complex composition of bioaerosols and variation in human response as a function of exposure. It has been a widely followed activity to monitor bioaerosols in various micro-environments for epidemiological investigations of infectious diseases. The research on airborne micro-organism\u2019s abundance, spread and control represents as a quality control measure on monitoring bio-hazardous and relevance to their impact on climate (as CCN: cloud condensation nuclei and IN: ice nuclei).

The major concern among these allergens is on the pollens. Pollen grains represent as the male gametophyte in sexual reproduction of flowering plants (angiosperms) and conifers (gymnosperms). Pollination refers to a process of transfer of pollen grains from male to reproductive structure of female. It can be accomplished via three routes: vectors-wind, water or animals. The flowers of these plants often do not have petals, and thus, anthers (pollen sacs) are directly exposed to air. Hence, pollens from anemophilous plants are most abundant in ambient atmosphere and have tremendous influence in terms of human exposure and related seasonal allergies. Pollen grains are nearly spherical in shape, at least under hydrated condition, with a rigid cell wall structure formed up of a complex polysaccharide substance known as sporopollenin.",

It involves transmission of infectious agents in air from a reservoir to a susceptible host.(i)\nBacteria-induced diseases: Various diseases due to bacteria such as tuberculosis and legionellosis are of more concern as far as public health is concerned owing to their pretty fast response against low infectious dose. Most important ones have been discussed as follows.\n\nAnthrax: The transmission occurs due to inhalation of the Bacillus anthracis spores and the outbreaks are usually linked with occupational exposure-based bioterrorism.\nIllness by endotoxin: Endotoxin is the lipopolysaccharide (toxin) component of Gram-negative bacterial cell wall. These are potent pyrogens, capable of causing fever at very low concentrations. High exposure to endotoxins could lead to nausea and diarrhoea.\nLegionellosis:\nLegionella pneumophila causes human legionellosis and nosocomial pneumonia in adults following occupational/non-occupational exposures. Certain active aerosolize processes, for example aeration of contaminated waters, cause legionellae to become airborne. There occurrence has been noticed in various water environments including man-designed water systems, biofilms in the cooling towers, A/C (air conditioners).\nTuberculosis: The transmission of tubercle bacilli occurs upon inhalation of aerosolized bacilli in droplet of expectorated sputum-positive from tuberculosis patients during ejection of cough, sneezing and occasionally while talking. There have been outbreaks of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in the UK that have highlighted the potential for transmission within the hospital environment.\n(ii)\nFungal diseases: Fungi are saprophytic parasitic organisms that occupy a kingdom of their own. They can cause the aerobic decay of plant materials and are ubiquitous in air, often as the predominant component of bioaerosols. The fungal cell is eukaryotic and embodies a well-developed membrane system. The rigid cell wall is made up of \u03b2-glucans and acetyl glucosamine polymers (chitin). Their wall often contains waxes and has extra cellular polysaccharides coating. Fungi can be identified by the method and nature of spore production. Lichens can be formed from the fungi and algae following a symbiotic relationship. Most of the spores and pollens have density near to unity, and thus, their aerodynamic diameter primarily depends on its shape as well as its size. It is worthwhile mentioning that many spores are hygroscopic, and therefore, their aerodynamic diameter increases as a function of increasing humidity. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites of some fungal species such as Fusarium, Aspergillus, Penicillium and Trichoderma. Fungi causing respiratory infections and allergenic reactions to humans include Penicillium, Cladosporium, Acremonium, Paecilomyces, Aspergillus and Mucor. Most infections (commonest being Aspergillosis) occur in immune-compromised hosts upon inhalation of fungal spores or toxins produced by them. Symptoms include watering eyes, persistent cold, prolonged muscular cramp and joints pain. Histoplasma, Coccidioides and Blastomyces grow in soil or may be carried by bats and birds and are linked with the exposure to airborne/animal-borne contamination. The volatile organic products released from fungal metabolism have ability to induce irritation in eyes and in the upper respiratory tract. Aspergillus species that can grow in indoor environments include Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus ftavus and can cause nosocomial infections, allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and sinusitis.\n",

Aflatoxin from Aspergillus flavus is capable of causing liver cancer whereas Ochratoxin Asia is a plausible human carcinogen. Exposure to aflatoxin and ochratoxin usually occurs by the ingestion. However, it can also occur by inhalation in industries of peanut processing, livestock feed processing or when grain dust exposure occurs.

In aeroallergen studies, suitable magnification can vary from low (e.g. 3.5X), for viewing fungal fruiting bodies with a stereo microscope, to very high (e.g. 10,000X), for assessing surface of pollen grain from electron microscope. Although commonly used to identify fungal spores and pollens in air samples, microscopy also facilitates identifying fungal colonies in culture and spores associated with dust or other source samples. Most common airborne pollen grains can be studied with an optimal magnification for sample scanning and identification of 300\u2013400X. Counting of many fungal spores and most pollen grains can be accomplished with a microscope having magnification at least a 100X oil immersion as well as 40\u201310X objectives. Bacteria are rarely recognizable in particulate air samples unless proper staining techniques are used.",

Apart from the dry aerosol, we also used PSL (polystyrene latex) particles tagged with active groups to determine and optimize the impactor cut-point.

At times they are also responsible for severity of asthma. Endotoxin is shed off from the outer membrane of GNB as membrane fragments while growing or dying GNB. When endotoxin is purified, it consists of family of proteins called as lipopolysaccharides (LPS).

Their abundance can be influenced by environmental conditions such as substrate availability, humidity and temperature. Since these conditions are favourable outdoor, GNB and therefore endotoxin are ubiquitous outdoors. High levels have been detected in numerous settings especially where organic dust is present such as in agricultural and related industries. Filter media is usually used to collect endotoxin aerosols because they allow for long collection times and are easy to practically use. At times, all glass impingers are used but they may underestimate endotoxin because of their low collection efficiency for sub-micron particles which contain large amount of endotoxin.",

LAL assay is based on the observation of a gel clot formation when an endotoxin comes in contact with clot table protein from circulating amoebocytes of Limulus. For LAL assay, endotoxin is extracted from filters with an aqueous extraction medium. Most laboratories use pathogen-free water, while some use buffers as tris and phosphate triethylamine (pH: 7.5) or dispersing agents such as tween \u221220, and it was reported that endotoxin activity was seven times higher in tween medium as compared to that in any pathogen-free water.",

Generally, environmental samples for endotoxin analysis should not be frozen especially after their extraction. Alternatively, the most widely preferred in vitro method is the LAL assay owing to high sensitivity. However, this assay does not mimic for the in vivo pyrogenic activity. Following this assay, major and minor pyrogens, endotoxin (C pathway), and 1, 3\u2013glucans \u03b2 (G pathway) of fungi can be measured. However, this assay gives negative result for the pyrogenic substances from Gram-positive bacteria (GPB). Depending on the chemical and physiochemical structure of the endotoxin, the reactivity of the LAL reagent also differs. The LAL assay is a comparative toxicity bioassay and not an analytical assay. This means the measured endotoxin levels can be altered by factors other than the actual LPS concentration. Due to this very reason, the interpretation of the results becomes difficult especially when comparing observation from different filter media.",

A variety of LAL assays are gel clot, chromogenic measurements and turbidimetry. The chromogenic assay depends on a chromogen, which changes its color in the presence of endotoxin (in sample). The chromogen release is a function of the concentration of endotoxin. Optical measurement device operating at wavelength pertaining to chromogen signal is required. LPS can also be detected in environmental samples via chemical methods. These methods are based on assessing chemical markers of LPS. Of these markers, 3-hydroxy fatty acids are most commonly utilized for characterization of endotoxin and GNB. Gas chromatography technique is the most followed method to do this characterization.",

This region holds ~40% of the south Asia\u2019s population and produces over 85% of the rice-wheat (Gupta et al. 2004; Rajput and Sarin 2014; Singh et al. 2014a). Nearly 20 million hectares of agricultural land area is located in NW part of IGP (states of Punjab, Haryana and western part of Uttar Pradesh). Due to crop rotation activity, a conspicuous seasonal and annual feature, farmers burn 100s of million tons of paddy residues (during October\u2013November) and wheat residues (during April\u2013May) (Gupta et al. 2004; Momin et al. 1999; Punia et al. 2008; Rajput et al. 2014a, b, c). Under prevailing NW winds, our sampling site is strategically located downwind of the major agricultural fields in IGP (Rajput et al. 2011a, 2015; Singh and Gupta 2015, 2016a). Thus, the sampling location is influenced by massive biomass burning activities (Kumar et al. 2017; Rajput et al. 2016b). The region experiences usually ~1000 mm annual precipitation with harsh summers and cold winters associated with fog events (Rajput et al. 2016a; Singh et al. 2014b). However, year 2015 (annual rainfall of 375 mm) was influenced due to El Ni\u00f1o (Rajeev et al. 2016).ii.\nSampling and measurements\n\n",

Using a single-stage impactor (aerodynamic diameter >0.6 \u03bcm) sampler (flow rate: 12 LPM) (Gupta and Chauhan 2014b), viable bioaerosols were collected at ~1.5 m from ground level and cultured in petri dishes equipped with specific nutrient agar mediums. We have collected (three days a week) and cultured GPB in Mannitol Salt Agar Broth (MSAB), GNB in MacConkey and Fungi in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar medium. Briefly, petri dishes (n = 3 for each day sampling) equipped with specific nutrient agar mediums were placed in the air sampler and the collection was subjected to 4 min for each three types of mediums sequentially. Soon after the collection, these bioaerosols in separate petri dishes were incubated at 35 \u2103 for microbial culture in our lab (Atmospheric Particle Technology Lab, in CESE). Subsequently, their enumeration (counting) through magnifying lens was performed into a bio-safety cabinet. Well established protocol has been followed to proper sterilize the sampler as well as nutrient media every time prior to sampling. The observations of colony counting for GPB, GNB and Fungi for different incubation periods are shown in Fig. 5.9. The results shown in Fig. 5.6 suggest that 48 h of incubation is the optimum culture period for GPB and GNB, whereas 72 h is optimum period for Fungi culture.\n",

However, our main purpose of collecting PM10 samples was to determine the concentrations of organic carbon (OC).

            "text": "Assessing inter-relationship of bioaerosols with prevailing meteorology is very important to understand the feedback between ecosystem and meteorology (Jones and Harrison 2004; Murata and Zhang 2016; Rathnayake et al. 2016b; Ziemba et al. 2016). In order to identify potential predictors (factors) influencing the viable bioaerosols concentration (GPB, GNB and Fungi) over IGP, a correlation matrix based on linear regression analysis has been generated utilizing concentrations of these bioaerosols and OC along with several meteorological parameters [temperature (T), relative humidity (%RH), wind speed (WS) and daily rainfall; Table 5.3]. The uncertainty level on interpreting results on correlation analysis is less than 5% (p < 0.05). It is evident from the figure that GPB exhibits a significant positive linear relation with GNB (r = 0.68; n = 130), suggesting plausibility on their co-genetic sources and/or their viability under identical ambient conditions (Table 5.3). A positive linear correlation also exists between GPB and Fungi, but not to a significant level. GPB correlates positively with OC concentrations (r = 0.60) and negatively with ambient T (r = \u22120.66). The other meteorological parameters viz. RH, wind speed and rainfall do not show any trend on a significant level. Interestingly, close observations of influence of rainfall on ambient levels of GPB reveals that rainfall greater than 4 mm relates to lowering of GPB concentration. In contrast, daily rainfall \u2248 1\u20134 mm appears to positively correlate with GPB concentrations (Table 5.3). Similar to GPB, GNB also exhibits a positive trend with Fungi, but not to a significant level. Likewise, GNB correlates positively with OC concentrations (r = 0.87) and negatively with ambient T (r = \u22120.64). Other observations through linear correlation analysis of GNB with meteorological parameters viz. RH, wind speed and rainfall are near similar to that discussed above for GPB, and hence not repeated again. Fungi colony concentrations do not correlate significantly with any herein reported parameter (Table 5.3). Influence of daily rainfall \u2248 1\u20134 mm appears to positively correlate with Fungi concentrations; higher precipitation decreases levels of Fungi along with other atmospheric pollutants. Massive emissions from open field crop residue and biofuel burning in the IGP have been documented previously (Gustafsson et al. 2009; Momin et al. 1999; Rajput et al. 2014b, 2016c; Ram et al. 2010; Venkataraman et al. 2005). As aforementioned, the air-masses during the post-monsoon and winter season exhibit influence of transport from upwind IGP. Temporal variations in FFA and viable bioaerosols abundance with a positive linear relationship among GPB, GNB and OC suggest their co-genetic source and/or common atmospheric transport process. These inter-relationships highlight the significant role of biomass burning emissions (PRB and biofuels) in contributing to bioaerosols.\n",

As far as viable bioaerosols are concerned, the highest concentration of GPB was recorded during December\u2013January (Avg.: 189 CFU/m3), GNB during November (Avg.: 244 CFU/m3) and Fungi in September (Avg.: 188 CFU/m3). A significant positive linear correlation-ship for GPB and GNB with OC (p < 0.05) in conjunction with their variability pattern indicates their co-genetic source. Fungi also exhibit a positive trend with OC, but not to a significant level (p > 0.05). We have attributed major source of bioaerosols to be associated with massive emissions from PRB and biofuel burning in the IGP. Ambient temperature shows a negative impact on the abundance of GPB and GNB, whereas RH and wind speed do not exhibit any pronounced effects. Low precipitation (1\u20134 mm) relates to higher concentrations of bioaerosols particularly the Fungi.
