It is assumed that antibiotics are efficacious for all bronchiectasis exacerbations, but not all practitioners agree. Inadequately treated exacerbations may risk lung function deterioration. Our study tests the hypothesis that both oral azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid are superior to placebo at improving resolution rates of respiratory exacerbations by day 14 in children with bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis.",

In the component of BEST presented here, 189 children fulfilling inclusion criteria are randomised (allocation-concealed) to receive amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (22.5 mg/kg twice daily) with placebo-azithromycin; azithromycin (5 mg/kg daily) with placebo-amoxicillin-clavulanic acid; or placebo-azithromycin with placeboamoxicillin-clavulanic acid for 14 days. Clinical data and a paediatric cough-specific quality of life score are obtained at baseline, at the start and resolution of exacerbations, and at day 14. In most children, blood and deep nasal swabs are also collected at the same time points. The primary outcome is the proportion of children whose exacerbations have resolved at day 14. The main secondary outcome is the paediatric cough-specific quality of life score. Other outcomes are time to next exacerbation; requirement for hospitalisation; duration of exacerbation; and spirometry data. Descriptive viral and bacteriological data from nasal samples and blood markers will also be reported. Discussion: Effective, evidence-based management of exacerbations in people with bronchiectasis is clinically important. Yet, there are few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the neglected area of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Indeed, no published RCTs addressing the treatment of bronchiectasis exacerbations in children exist. Our multicentre, double-blind RCT is designed to determine if azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, compared with placebo, improve symptom resolution on day 14 in children with acute respiratory exacerbations. Our planned assessment of the predictors of antibiotic response, the role of antibiotic-resistant respiratory pathogens, and whether early treatment with antibiotics affects duration and time to the next exacerbation, are also all novel.",

            "text": "Compared to the early 20th century, the prevalence of bronchiectasis has fallen substantially. Although regarded as an 'orphan disease' in affluent countries, reports of prevalence of bronchiectasis are increasing [1, 2] . Bronchiectasis remains a major contributor to chronic respiratory morbidity [2, 3] and mortality [1, 4] in both Indigenous [5] and non-Indigenous populations [6] . In our recently completed multicentre study of children newly referred for chronic cough and managed in accordance to a standardised protocol [7] , 31 (9%) of the 346 children had bronchiectasis proven on radiology [8] . In the Northern Territory in Australia, the incidence of bronchiectasis in the first year of life is 118 in 100,000 [9] . The estimated prevalence of bronchiectasis is 1,470 per 100,000 in Central Australian Indigenous children aged below 15 years [10] and 1,600 per 100,000 in Alaskan Native children [11] . In the United States, reported prevalence in adults range from 4.2 to 271.8 per 100,000 [6] . However, any reported prevalence is likely to be an underestimate as many cases are misdiagnosed or coexist with other diseases like asthma [12] [13] [14] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [15] . Even without accounting for these unrecognised cases, globally there are far more patients with bronchiectasis than cystic fibrosis (CF), which has a prevalence of 7.4 to 7.9 per 100,000 in the European Union and the United States [14] .",

There is increasing evidence that intensive treatment of children who either have bronchiectasis or are at risk of developing severe bronchiectasis prevents poor lung function in adulthood [17] [18] [19] [20] . Cohort data have shown that approximately 80% of newly diagnosed adults (non-smokers) with bronchiectasis reported symptoms dating back to childhood and that the duration of chronic cough (the most common symptom of bronchiectasis [21] ) was related (r = \u22120.51, P < 0.001) to lung function at diagnosis [22] . Arguably, appropriate overall management and treatment of exacerbations (leading to reduction of persistent symptoms) potentially prevents or reduces deterioration of chronic respiratory disease [23] .",

Our retrospective study found that 34% of exacerbations were preceded by a viral-like illness [29] . While most respiratory physicians will treat exacerbations intensively (with antibiotics and airway clearance), other doctors do not. Those choosing not to use antibiotics routinely argue that most episodes of exacerbations and cough are caused by viral infections and hence do not require antibiotic therapy. This may be appropriate but viral-bacterial interactions in the airways risk prolonged endobronchial bacterial infection that, with the associated inflammatory cascade, may cause further lung injury [23, 30] . Better evidence to guide the management of exacerbations in people with bronchiectasis is needed.",

The marked paucity of RCTs [21, 55] is reflected in the existence of only a single (small) published placebo-controlled RCT in children with bronchiectasis [21, 56] . That study described a reduction in sputum purulence and airway hyper-responsiveness in children receiving roxithromycin (n = 13) [57] . There are no RCTs on the management of bronchiectasis exacerbations in children [58] . Almost all current recommendations are based on CF management [21, 28] . Such extrapolation can, on occasions, be detrimental for those with non-CF bronchiectasis. For example, a large RCT found that deoxyribonuclease (efficacious for CF) increased exacerbations and decline in FEV 1 in adults with bronchiectasis [59] despite prior case reports advocating its use [60] .",
