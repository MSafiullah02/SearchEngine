            "text": "Arthropod-borne viruses are referred to as viruses transmitted either to animals or humans by blood-sucking arthropods [1]. There are over 700 known arthropod-borne viruses and at least 80 immunologically distinct types that cause diseases in humans [2]. Most of the arthropod-borne viral infections are transmitted by mosquitoes. Transmission of these viruses to humans involves complex processes influenced by the mosquito and viral genetics, environmental factors and human activities [3]. Mosquitoes belonging to the genus Aedes are the major vectors of Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV), Rift Valley fever (RVFV), Yellow fever (YFV) and Zika (ZIKV) [4]. These mosquito-borne viral diseases are often misdiagnosed with other febrile illnesses, such as malaria due to lack of differential diagnostic tools [5]. The geographical distribution patterns of these mosquito-borne viruses are related to the presence of their mosquito vectors; and overlap as they share common vectors. Therefore, co-infection or co-occurrence of more than one mosquito-borne virus species in a certain geographical location is common [6].",

The DRC harbours rich fauna, flora and biodiversity which offer suitable opportunity for the emergence of numerous viral diseases. A number of mosquito-borne virus species have been documented in some regions of DRC during the last century. The first yellow fever outbreak in DRC was reported from Kongo-Central in 1912 [7]. Thereafter a number of studies on YFV and other mosquito-borne viral infections were carried out and extended to other geographical locations until the end of colonial period in 1960 [8]. During the past two decades, repeated outbreaks of Chikungunya and Yellow fever have been reported in DRC. During the same time, the circulation of other mosquito-borne viruses of public health importance such as DENV, ZIKV, RVFV and West Nile virus (WNV) have also been recorded [9\u201311]. This review attempts to summarize the available data on mosquito-borne viral infections in DRC in order to provide an insight of their geographical distribution, virus species diversity, mosquito vectors and animal reservoirs. In addition, the review explores the risks factors associated with their transmission and epidemic occurrence.",

This was the first autochthonous YFV outbreak in the DRC and it caused a mortality rate as high as 63.4% [17]. From 1948 to 1957, yellow fever cases were regularly recorded in DRC. In 1958, the country experienced two major outbreaks: first in Gemena township of the Sud-Ubangi Province (case fatality rate of 36.5%) [18] and another outbreak (co-infection with chikungunya) in the Territory of Dungu from Haut-Uel\u00e9 Province [14]. Afterwards, in 1960, another yellow fever outbreak was reported from Bili village in Bondo territory of Bas-U\u00e9l\u00e9 Province [15]. After the independence in 1960, yellow fever outbreaks kept on recurring in all 26 provinces of DRC. From 2001 to 2004, a nationwide surveillance reported about 400 yellow fever suspected cases annually without a biological confirmation and a lethality rate of 3% in 2004 [10]. In a demographic survey of 2013\u20132014, an overall YFV prevalence of 31.5% among children was reported in DRC [9]. Despite the implementation of a yellow fever vaccination programme (involving children 9 months-old) in DRC since 2003, most vaccinated children failed to demonstrate sufficient proof of seroconversion [9]. From 2010\u20132016, four yellow fever outbreaks resulting from either autochthonous or imported infections were reported in DRC [19\u201322]. The 2016 outbreak was the largest with causing a total of 393 deaths. While, initially the majority of recorded yellow fever cases were imported from neighbouring Angola, 90% of deaths in 2016 were recorded in a single Province of Kongo-Centrale [23]. The autochthonous cases of YFV have also been documented in the provinces of Bas-Uele, Equateur, Kasai-Central, Kinshasa, Kwango, Lualaba, Tshuapa and Kongo-Central [22] (Table 1).\n",

            "text": "The two first reported chikungunya cases in the DRC occurred during a yellow fever outbreak in north-eastern region. The first was in 1958 in Haut-Uel\u00e9 Province [14], and the second in 1960 in the neighbouring Province of Bas-U\u00e9l\u00e9 in Bondo territory [15]. Since then, no circulation of CHIKV was documented in DRC until 1998 [11]. In 1998, of 45 patients sampled during an outbreak of WNV in Kisangani City in Tshopo Province of the north-eastern region, 28.8% patients were found positive for CHIKV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies [11]. Kinshasa, the capital of DRC experienced three chikungunya outbreaks during 1999 and 2000, with an estimated 50,000 suspected cases [28]. These outbreaks occurred after heavy rains in the urban areas of Matete and Kingabwa municipalities. The third occurred in the sub-rural area of Ndaku-ya-Mpembe in the Kinkole municipality. More than half (57.9%) the samples tested positive for CHIKV IgM antibodies and nine strains were isolated in C6/36 cells [28]. Furthermore, another outbreak was recorded in 2012 from three new areas (Maluku, Mont-ngafula and Mbinza Meteo health zones) in Kinshasa [16]. Of 10 cases of chikungunya recorded among Belgian travellers between 2007 and 2012, six were from DRC [29]. In a retrospective countrywide surveillance study carried out between 2003 and 2011, of the 453 sera screened, two positive cases of CHIKV were detected by RT-PCR. One case was from Gemena in the Sud-Ubangi Province in north-western DRC and the other from the Province of Kwilu [10]. In a survey carried out in 2015, from 96 patients tested negative for malaria in Kinshasa, the seroprevalence of CHIKV was 9.6% and 5 samples were found positive for CHIKV by RT-PCR [30]. Based on a genetic study, the isolates of CHIKV that were found to circulate in DRC belonged to the Congo genotype which is closely related to the Central African Republic and Uganda isolates [31] (Table 2). African buffalo, chimpanzee and elephant from Haut-Uel\u00e9 Province have been identified as potential hosts or reservoirs of CHIKV by detecting the presence of antibodies from these species (Table 3) [32, 33].\n\n",

The specific neutralizing antibodies against WNV in Haut-Uel\u00e9 Province have been detected in chimpanzee in Ango, Bondo [32], in buffalo and elephant in the Garamba National Park [35]. In a survey carried out in Kinshasa in 2004, nine (30%) out of 20 horses were WNV seropositive using ELISA and western blot analysis [38]. Afterwards, a 12.5% seroprevalence of WNV was reported in Kinshasa [39]. These observations provide evidence of an animal role in the enzootic circulation of WNV in the DRC.",

Entomological indices even during outbreaks within the regions with high mosquito-borne virus transmission risk are lacking in most cases. Moreover, Ae. aegypti and Ae. simpsoni were the most recorded in the regions where mosquito-borne virus outbreaks occurred. Yet, in certain areas, the presence of these Aedes species were not significantly recorded during outbreaks [41]. The entomological investigation during the first yellow fever outbreak at Matadi failed to collect a significant number of Ae. aegypti at that time [42]. Ten years later, Ae. aegypti predominated during the second yellow fever outbreak in Matadi and neighbouring townships [17], while in Gemena, Ae. simpsoni and Ae. aegypti were found in proportions of 90% and 10%, respectively during these outbreaks [18]. In the Bongo and Ango territories, where many mosquito-borne viruses reports are documented, Ae. aegypti predominated Ae. simpsoni [32]. In the four, last of the yellow fever outbreaks, Ae. aegypti larvae were collected from various breeding habitats in both natural and artificial breeding sites, while most positive breeding habitats were artificial [19\u201322]. A range of mosquitoes circulating in Kinshasa were found infected with different arboviruses [13]. O\u2019nyong\u2019nyong virus has been detected in Anopheles and unspecified flavivirus was detected in Culex mosquitoes (Table 3). Aedes albopictus has been recently established in Kinshasa [12], where the most recent outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue have been reported [16, 28, 30]; its implication in spreading mosquito-borne viruses in DRC needs to be investigated. It is important that vector species, distribution pattern, competence and virus infection rates are established. Furthermore, studies on the genetic population and vector competence will be more helpful in improving the understanding on transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne viruses in DRC.",

These driving factors range from demographic, socioeconomic, environmental to climatic factors. Moreover, evidence of population movement as key driving factor of spreading yellow fever has been documented [41]. High population density seems to play a key role in the occurrence and spread of mosquito-borne virus outbreaks [11, 41]. For instance, the WNV outbreak in Kisangani started at army camps where immigrated soldiers from different locations across the whole country were concentrated before it spread to another area [11]. In addition, the increase of animal and human population movements is very likely to be considered as important drivers of mosquito-borne viral infections in DRC [11, 41]. The human exposures to forest activities and deforestation activities in cities have been associated to the yellow fever outbreaks [18]. In addition, significant rates of antibodies against YFV have been detected among chimpanzee from savannah areas compared to those captured in forest areas [32]. In Gemena city, the yellow fever outbreaks have been observed during large deforestation activities [18]. The overall geographical distribution of both mosquito-borne viruses and their potential vectors species seemed to be influenced by climate distribution pattern in DRC. The majority of outbreaks or positive cases occurred during the rainy seasons. The West Nile outbreak was preceded by heavy rainfall in Kisangani in 1998 [11]. Similarly, in Kinshasa, in 1999\u20132000, the large chikungunya outbreak followed heavy rainfall [28].",

            "text": "The overall findings indicate that mosquito-borne viral infections are an emerging and re-emerging health concern in the DRC. However, little attention has been paid and many questions on its epidemiology, socio-ecology and anthropology need to be addressed. While mosquito-borne viruses are re-emerging or emerging across the whole country, the north-western, north-eastern and western parts of the DRC are the most affected areas, experiencing multiple outbreaks compared to other parts of the country [9\u201311, 14, 15, 19\u201322]. This geographical distribution pattern of mosquito-borne viruses appeared to be linked to profile of the distribution, diversity and abundance of their potential vector species; most likely to be influenced by climate distribution pattern in DRC. In the eastern region, Ae. aegypti was rarely reported [43] compared to other regions [12, 44\u201348]. Indeed, the northern regions are experiencing an equatorial climate with rain throughout the year. From the central region to western region the climate is tropical with long rains, while in eastern and southern regions the climate is tropical but semi-arid. The Congo Basin has warmed between 0.2\u20130.3 \u00b0C per decade and reached 1 \u00b0C in 1992. The average annual precipitation has declined by 8\u201312% from 1960 to 1998. Climate change is manifested in DRC by short periods of heavy rainfall leading to multiple flooding events followed by early droughts [49, 50]. This considerable fluctuation in the climate regime causing either drought or flooding has an influence on vector abundance and diversity [51]. Most probably, heavy rainfalls are creating suitable mosquito breeding habitats, hence transmission of mosquito-borne viruses. Nevertheless, due to climate variability and increasing population movements, these mosquito species might establish successfully over time and change this general trend. Although, there is evidence of ZIKV, DENV and RVFV circulation in DRC, no epidemic has been reported so far.",

This underlines the importance of better identification of different local vectors in each region or specific area within regions, and to assess competence of the vectors to transmit mosquito-borne viruses. Intensive deforestation activities in Gemena city provided an opportunity for mosquito-borne viruses to emerge [18]. It is likely because of the degradation of the forest habitats during these activities, Aedes mosquitoes invaded the city and successfully established in their new habitats closer to humans, leading to a high human mosquito biting rate in a deforested area. Indeed, the increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to deforestation warms up the climate and causes changes in rainfall patterns leading to conditions of flood or drought. The establishment of new suitable habitats is creating an opportunity for new mosquito species to proliferate [52]. This is in corroboration with observations from Brazil, where deforestation has been involved in sylvatic yellow fever outbreaks [53]. It was reported that mosquitoes which are known to be zoophilic and sylvatic have invaded the peridomestic and periurban settlements and started to feed on humans [53]. Similar observations from the Ivory Coast illustrated the impact of land-use modifications on the abundance, distribution, and host-seeking behaviour of Aedes mosquitoes [54]. A study in the Amazon concluded that deforestation is responsible for the increase in malaria incidence [55]. This observation could emphasize the impact of significant deforestation observed across the DRC in relation to the emergence of mosquito-borne viral diseases and repeated outbreaks in the country. There is currently a need to investigate the impact of environmental factors and the role of climate change on current mosquito-borne virus geographical distribution and predicting potential distribution in the future.",

Climate affects growth, survival and abundance of the vectors and virus replication load in the vector. Temperature is the major climate component susceptible to accelerate or decelerate mosquito reproduction and virus replication in the host depending on low and high temperature thresholds. Increased levels of precipitation lead to multiple microhabitats for oviposition and an efficient larval development pattern [51]. The higher rainfall levels due to climate change were associated with RFV outbreaks in eastern Africa during 2015\u20132016 [56].",

This region constitutes long borders with Zambia, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and South Sudan. Most of these countries are known to be endemic of Rift Valley fever [56\u201360]. It is likely that the active and uncontrolled migration of human and animal population might have played a key role in spreading of RVFV in the DRC. Considering the largest cattle population in eastern DRC, the situation represents a real health threat that needs more attention. The role of population movement in the emergence and spread of mosquito-borne viruses have been illustrated in a recent study of a yellow fever outbreak which started in Angola and was imported to the DRC through trans-boundary trade between the two countries [41]. Environmental and climate factors, human activities and population movement are likely contributing enormously to the emergence and re-emergence of mosquito-borne viruses. An exponential demographic growth of Kinshasa with poor environmental hygiene and low urbanisation level is likely to have favoured Aedes mosquito productivity and might explain in part the frequent chikungunya and yellow fever outbreaks in the city.",

The tendency is that the continuous geographical expansion of mosquito-borne viruses leads to fears that multiple epidemic outbreaks are likely to arise in the DRC. There is a dearth of information on mosquitoes, in particular Aedes, which is known to be the main vector of major mosquito-borne viruses. The lack of information is a barrier to appropriate knowledge on the ecology and epidemiology of mosquito-borne viruses, which is crucial in the design of appropriate interventions.
