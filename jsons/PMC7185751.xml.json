            "text": "The rate-limiting step in peptide catalysis by the serine proteases is thought to be either formation or breakdown of a tetrahedral intermediate formed by the addition of the hydroxyl group of the catalytic serine to the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond being hydrolysed. The tight binding of aldehydes to the cysteine protease papain was attributed to the formation of a thiohemiacetal by the addition of the thiolate ion of the catalytic cysteine to the carbonyl of the peptide bond being hydrolysed analogous to the tetrahedral intermediate formed during catalysis [5]. Similar proposals were made when aldehydes were found to be potent inhibitors of the serine protease elastase [6]. Using 1H-NMR indirect evidence for hemiacetal formation with the serine protease chymotrypsin was obtained using saturation transfer [7], [8], [9]. Direct observation of a hemiacetal signal was reported using 19F-NMR with N-Acetyl-p-fluorophenylalinals and \u03b1-chymotrypsin [10], [11]. 13C-NMR studies of the aldehyde inhibitor Acetyl-Phe-CHO binding to \u03b1-chymotrypsin have shown two hemiacetals are formed [12]. 13C-NMR has shown that the aldehyde inhibitor leupeptin (N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-Arg-CHO) also forms two diastereomeric hemiacetals with trypsin [13]. However, with Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO it was reported that only one hemiacetal signal was observed [14]. The fact that only small changes (\u2264 4 fold) in Ki values have been observed from pH 3\u20138 when aldehyde inhibitors bind to chymotrypsin, has led to the suggestion that the hemiacetal formed with chymotrypsin remains neutral from pH 3\u20138 [11], [15]. Likewise, the fact that the chemical shifts of the hemiacetals observed with Acetyl-Phe-CHO [12] or Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO [14] did not titrate significantly at pHs > 7 has been used to support the suggestion that the hemiacetals are neutral from pH 3\u20138. However, with trypsin the hydroxy groups of both the diastereomeric hemiacetals formed with leupeptin and Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO ionized showing oxyanion formation with pKa values of 4.69 and 5.67 [13]. We have also shown that there is oxyanion formation (pKa ~ 5) in chymotrypsin glyoxal inhibitor complexes formed with Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-COCHO (Scheme 1D) [16]. Therefore in this study we use 13C-NMR to determine whether there is oxyanion formation in the corresponding chymotrypsin-aldehyde inhibitor complexes formed with Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO (Scheme 1C) from pH 3 to 11. This allows us to compare how chymotrypsin stabilizes oxyanion formation in hemiacetals and hemiketals [16], [17].",

In this study we use a similar approach to quantify hemiacetal formation in a chymotrypsin\u2013aldehyde inhibitor complex and to determine the effective molarity of the hydroxyl group of the catalytic serine residue in this complex. We also undertake an extensive 1H-NMR study of how the ionization state of the active site histidine residue changes when aldehyde inhibitors are bound. This allows us to determine how oxyanion formation affects the histidine pKa and also whether a high histidine pKa is required for the active site serine hydroxyl group to have a high effective molarity. Finally we discuss the mechanistic significance of these results.",

The signal at 38.7 ppm is due the d6\n = DMSO (1.8% (v/v)) used to make the inhibitor stock solution and the signal at 91.2 ppm (JCH 163.4 Hz) (Fig. 1c) is due to a small excess of the inhibitor (Fig. 1a).

A hydrate cannot form diastereoisomers and would only give one NMR signal. Therefore the fact that we observe two 13C-NMR signals confirms that two diastereomeric hemiacetals have been formed and that the inhibitor is not bound as a hydrate.

Therefore the titration shift is assigned to formation of the hemiacetal oxyanion when Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO forms a hemiacetal with chymotrypsin. Ionization of the isoleucine-16/aspartate-194 ion pair causes a conformational change which inactivates chymotrypsin [19], [24]. The binding of ligands and or chemical modification of the active site serine hydroxyl is known to raise the pKa of the isoleucine-16/aspartate-194 ion pair to a value of 10.5\u201311.0 [16], [19] and so we assign the pKa of 10.65 to ionization of the isoleucine-16/aspartate-194 ion pair. The smaller signal at 99.2 ppm(Fig. 1c) titrated with a similar pKa of 7.0(Fig. 2C) but the titration shift (\u03b42-\u03b41) was smaller (Table 3).",

This shows that chymotrypsin is stabilizing the hemiacetal oxyanion of both diastereoisomers by similar amounts. In order to quantify this stabilization we need to determine the hemiacetal pKa in the absence of enzyme stabilization. This can be done using free energy relationships [25]. The pKa of ZAAF-13COOH (Scheme 1B) was determined by 13C-NMR to be 3.52 \u00b1 0.03. Using the relationship \u03c3* = (4.644-pKa)/1.7 [26] for ZAAF-COOH the substituent constant, \u03c3* = 0.66 for the substituent ZAAF\u2014. The substituent constant for EO\u2014 is 1.68 [27] and using these \u03c3* values and the relationship pKa\n = 15.9\u20131.42 \u03a3\u03c3* [28] we estimate that the pKa of the oxyanion of the hemiacetal formed when chymotrypsin and Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO react will be 12.6. Therefore chymotrypsin has lowered the pKa of the larger hemiacetal-1 (Fig. 1c) by 12.6\u20137.0 = 5.6 pKa units and the pKa of the smaller hemiacetal-2 (Fig. 1c) by a similar amount (Table 4\n). The oxyanions of both hemiacetals are therefore both stabilized by ~ 32 kJ mol\u2212 1 (Table 4).",

            "text": "In chymotrypsin signals at ~ 18 and ~ 13 ppm have been assigned to the N\u03b41 and N\u03b52 protons of the positively charged imidazolium ring of histidine-57 and the signal at ~ 15 ppm has been assigned to the N\u03b41 proton of the neutral imidazole ring [16], [29], [30], [31], [32]. In the glyoxal complex of \u03b1-chymotrypsin with Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-COCHO the signals at ~ 18 ppm and ~ 13 ppm are present at both low and high pHs at 25 \u00b0C demonstrating that the binding of the glyoxal inhibitor has raised the pKa of the active site histidine to a value > 11 [16]. In contrast, in the aldehyde complex of \u03b1-chymotrypsin and Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO the signals were barely discernable at 25 \u00b0C (Fig. 3A) and they were similar to those observed from free \u03b1-chymotrypsin under the same conditions (Fig. 3B). However, at 4 \u00b0C the signals at 17.9 ppm and ~ 13.0 ppm were clearly visible at low pH, both in the presence (Fig. 3C1) and absence (Fig. 3D1) of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO. Unlike with the analogous glyoxal inhibitor [16] these signals disappeared on increasing the pH and were replaced by a single large signal at 14.7 ppm at pHs > 9.4 and 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 3C8). This signal (Fig. 3C8) was similar to those observed with free \u03b1-chymotrypsin at 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 3D8). These signals were barely visible at 25 \u00b0C (Fig. 3A8,B8). This shows that there is more exchange broadening with the aldehyde inhibitor compared to its glyoxal analogue. Therefore the exchange rates are faster with the aldehyde inhibitor than with the glyoxal inhibitor. It also shows that with the aldehyde inhibitor the histidine pKa must be in the range 5\u20139. These spectra and the glyoxal inhibitor spectra were obtained using the Watergate W5 pulse sequence [20]. The 1331 water suppression pulse sequence [21] is effective over a smaller chemical shift range of 14\u201320 ppm, but it is more effective at detecting exchange broadened signals [14]. Therefore we have used the 1331 pulse sequence to follow the ionization of the imidazolium ion of histidine-57 by the pH titration of the N\u03b41 proton from ~ 18 to ~ 15 ppm in the presence and absence of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO at 25 and 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 4\n). From the pH dependence of the chemical shifts of the H-bonded protons (Fig. 5\n) the histidine-57 pKa values in free chymotrypsin and in the Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO-chymotrypsin complex were 7.32 \u00b1 0.18 (Fig. 5D) and 7.97 \u00b1 0.20 (Fig. 5C) respectively at 4 \u00b0C. Similar values of 7.35 \u00b1 0.09 and 7.87 \u00b1 0.18 were obtained for the free chymotrypsin (Fig. 5B) and the Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO\u2013chymotrypsin complex (Fig. 5A) respectively at 25 \u00b0C. The histidine pKa value for the free enzyme is similar to the values of 6.7 and 7.5 reported for \u03b1- and \u03b4-chymotrypsin respectively [16], [32]. The increase in the histidine pKa from 7.3 to 7.9 on adding Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO to \u03b1-chymotrypsin contrasts with the observed decrease in the histidine pKa to 6.5 when Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO binds to \u03b1-chymotrypsin [14].",

            "text": "Aldehydes have been widely used as potent inhibitors of the serine proteases [1], [2], [3], [33] and our results show that the aldehyde group can increase inhibitor potency by a factor of 100 (Table 1). The potency of this inhibition is usually attributed to the ability of the aldehyde group to react with active site serine hydroxyl group to form a hemiacetal that mimics the tetrahedral intermediate formed during substrate catalysis [6], [15]. The fact that the aldehyde group of ZAAF-CHO is readily hydrated (KH1obs\n = 13.9) illustrates how readily hydroxyl groups react with aldehyde carbonyl carbon to give a tetrahedral species. However, solvent water hydroxyl groups compete with the enzymes catalytic serine hydroxyl decreasing the concentration of the non-hydrated aldehyde group which reacts with hydroxyl group of the catalytic serine residue. Therefore the observed Ki values are normally corrected to allow for this using Kiobs\n = Ki(1 + KHYD). In our case the Ki value for ZAAF-CHO would be decreased by a factor of 14.9 to 0.11 \u03bcM. For ZAAFCOCHO we have shown that the active site serine hydroxyl group of chymotrypsin reacts with the keto carbonyl of the glyoxal group which has a lower KH1obs\n = 1.58 therefore the observed Ki will only be reduced by a factor of 2.58 to 0.14 \u03bcM which is similar to the corrected Ki value of 0.11 \u03bcM obtained with the aldehyde inhibitor. Therefore the fact that glyoxal inhibitors are bound ~ 4 fold more tightly than the corresponding aldehyde inhibitor is due to the fact that with the glyoxal inhibitors hemiketal formation occurs at the less effectively hydrated keto carbon as opposed to the more heavily hydrated aldehyde carbon.",

The diastereoisomer at 95.5 ppm predominates (~ 75%) with the diastereoisomer at 99.2 ppm making up the remaining ~ 25% of the hemiacetal formed. Two diastereoisomers were also observed when N-Acetyl-Phe-CHO was incubated with chymotrypsin but the proportions and chemical shifts were not reported [12]. Likewise when Leupeptin was incubated with trypsin two similar diastereoisomers were detected with chemical shifts of 98.8 ppm (86%) and 97.2 ppm (14%) [13]. These titrated with pKa values of 4.69 and 5.67. In the present work both the chymotrypsin diastereoisomers formed with Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO titrated but their pKa values were very similar at 6.9 and 7.0 (Table 4) suggesting that they are both in similar environments.",

One of these has the oxyanion in the oxyanion hole while in the other diastereoisomer the oxyanion points towards the active site histidine [14], [34], [35] and is hydrogen bonded to N\u03b52 of histidine-57. The oxyanion in the oxyanion hole is about 2.8 \u00c5 from the backbone amide nitrogens of serine-195 and glycine-193. However, in the other diastereoisomer the oxyanion is about 2.9 \u00c5 from the N\u03b52 nitrogen of the positively charged imidazolium ion of histidine-57. Therefore the oxyanions are in different electrostatic environments in the two diastereoisomers and so we would expect that they would have significantly different pKa values as is observed for the two diastereoisomeric hemiacetals observed in the Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO/trypsin complex [14]. The fact that in the Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO/chymotrypsin complex the oxyanion pKa values were ~ 7 for both diastereoisomers suggests that the oxyanions in both diastereoisomers are in similar electrostatic environments.",

            "text": "Since the binding Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO raised the pKa of histidine-57 to ~ 8 (Fig. 5) and the oxyanion pKa values of the diastereomeric hemiacetals were both ~ 7 (Fig. 2) it is expected that the positively charged histidine residue will play an important role in lowering the oxyanion pKa to ~ 7. The binding of Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO to \u03b1-chymotrypsin resulted in the formation of a hemiacetal signal at 102 ppm which did not titrate from pH 7 to 13 [14]. The chemical shift value of 102 ppm is larger than that observed (~ 100 ppm) when the oxyanion with Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO is fully formed (Fig. 2B,C). This suggests that the oxyanion is fully formed at pH 7 with Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO and so should have a pKa\n < 6. The histidine pKa of 6.5 in the Acetyl-Leu-Phe-CHO complex [14] shows that it should be able to stabilize the oxyanion. However, with glyoxal inhibitors the histidine pKa is raised to > 11 therefore it is clear that while aldehyde inhibitors like glyoxal inhibitors are bound tightly to chymotrypsin, they are much less effective at raising the pKa of the active site histidine in chymotrypsin. Although oxyanion stabilization is more effective with the aldehyde hemiacetal oxyanion than with the glyoxal hemiketal oxyanion (Table 4) the pKa of the imidazolium ion of histidine-57 is only raised to ~ 8 with hemiacetal formation (Table 6\n) while it is raised to > 11 with hemiketal formation in glyoxal complexes [16] inhibitor and to > 10 when peptidyl trifluoromethyl ketones [36] or peptidyl boronic acid [37] inhibitors form negatively charged tetrahedral adducts with chymotrypsin. This shows that oxyanion formation only has a minor role in raising the pKa of the imidazolium ion of histidine-57 in aldehyde inhibitor complexes. Therefore replacing the aldehyde hydrogen with an aldehyde group [16], [17] or trifluoromethylene group [38] is the major factor in strengthening the hydrogen bond between histidine-57 and aspartate-102, raising the pKa of the imidazolium ion of histidine-57 and ensuring that tetrahedral intermediate formation is stereospecific. Similar effects are expected during catalysis with substrates.",

This suggests that the inhibitor aldehyde hydrogen atom is not large enough to compress histidine-57-aspartate-32 hydrogen bond and/or screen it from solvent so that the histidine pKa is raised to a value > 10.

If the aldehyde inhibitor has only a small effect on the pKa of the active site histidine before tetrahedral adduct formation, then the fact that the effective molarity of the hydroxyl group of the catalytic serine group is only ~ 7 \u00d7 lower with the aldehyde inhibitor compared with its equivalent glyoxal inhibitor (Table 2) shows that a large increase in the pKa of histidine-57 is not required to increase the reactivity of the serine hydroxyl group for formation of the tetrahedral hemiacetal. This suggests that the expected increase in the effective molarity of the active site serine hydroxyl required for tetrahedral intermediate formation during catalysis cannot be solely attributed to a large increase in the pKa of histidine-57. Therefore we propose that the primary reason for the increase in the effective molarity of the catalytic hydroxyl when it binds substrates will be the entropic advantage achieved by optimally aligning the catalytic serine's hydroxy group with the carbonyl carbon of the peptide being hydrolysed.",

With aldehyde inhibitors there is stabilization of the hemiacetal oxyanion with its pKa being reduced by ~ 5.6 pKa units while the pKa of the active site histidine is only raised ~ 0.5 pKa units. Therefore we conclude that a large increase in the pKa of the active site histidine is not required for oxyanion stabilization or for the active site serine hydroxyl group to have an effective molarity of 6000. As the active site serine hydroxyl group is expected to have a pKa ~ 15 then we have argued [4], [16] that the large increase in the pKa of the active site histidine (i.e. pKa > 11) observed on binding glyoxal inhibitor is required for it to increase the reactivity of the serine hydroxyl group by general acid catalysis. But, with the aldehyde inhibitor there is only a small increase in the pKa of the active site histidine pKa to ~ 8. However, the effective molarity of the serine hydroxyl group with the aldehyde inhibitor is only ~ 7 fold smaller than that observed with the corresponding glyoxal inhibitor (Table 2). This clearly demonstrates that only a small part of the high reactivity of the serine hydroxyl group can be attributed to general base catalysis by the catalytic histidine residue of chymotrypsin.",
