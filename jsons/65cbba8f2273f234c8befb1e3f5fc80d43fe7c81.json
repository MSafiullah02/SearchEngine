The mechanism of action for quicklime is the resulting exothermic reaction that occurs when the chemical interacts with water and its ability to increase pH levels. These treatments may also reduce pathogens in a commercial poultry house. In this study, a steam sterilization cart simulated conditions used by the nursery industry to treat litter inoculated with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. A homogenized sample of litter was exposed to steam for 0, 5, 30, or 120 min. Quicklime was used at concentrations of 0 (control), 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0%. All steam treatments, with or without quicklime, significantly reduced Salmonella Typhimurium colonization by at least 3 orders of magnitude. Significant reductions were also observed in the treatments with quicklime alone. Both the steam and the quicklime treatments often reduced colonization to undetectable levels, even when samples were enriched. Therefore, we demonstrated 2 novel techniques for reducing Salmonella Typhimurium in poultry litter. Soil pasteurization potentially offers an environmentally sound means of reducing the pathogens present in used poultry litter.",

By a similar mechanism, calcium oxide, commonly referred to as quicklime (QL), may be used to enhance the effectiveness of steam pasteurization on used broiler litter. Water and QL react to form hydrated lime, carbon dioxide, and heat [8] . Lime is used to kill pathogens in sewage sludge before land application, and it is also applied to pastures that have an undesirably low pH [9, 10] . Bennett et al. [8] stated that manipulating the pH of litter may reduce the biological half-life of opportunistic and specific pathogens within poultry litter.

At placement, birds were orally gavaged with 3 \u00d7 10 8 cfu of ST/animal. Two weeks postchallenge, 100 lb (45.3 kg) of used litter was collected from the ST-challenged chickens. The litter was then mixed using a Wenger ribbon mixer [17] to ensure homogeneity. Twenty-pound (9.07-kg) aliquots were removed and mixed with 2 L of double-distilled water and the respective concentration of QL [18] to facilitate any chemical reactions. All treatments were mixed using a Hobart mixer [19] . The litter was then divided into two 10-lb The remaining duplicate samples were housed inside a poultry barn with no steam. Six litter grab samples were collected for each treatment by using clean gloves and Whirl-Pak [23] filtered bags. Five grams from each litter grab sample was added to individual Whirl-Pak filtered bags containing 45 mL of Butterfield's solution and stomached [24] for 30 s. A series of 10-fold dilutions were then performed and spread plated onto brilliant green agar [15] containing 25 \u03bcg/mL of novobiocin [16] and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. One milliliter of each undiluted sample wash was also enriched with 9 mL of tetrathionate broth [25] and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. After this incubation period, 0.1 mL of each enrichment solution was spread plated onto brilliant green agar [15] and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. The limit of detection of the undiluted sample was 1 \u00d7 10 2 cfu/g of litter [26] . Dilution samples that had no bacterial growth but were positive after enrichment were assigned a value of 1.50 log 10 according to the method of Corrier et al. [27] .

However, steam treatments have been used in commercial plant nurseries to control microorganisms in an environmentally responsible manner for more than 200 yr [30] . Quicklime, when mixed with water, produces an exothermic reaction and may be used in combination with steam to elevate temperatures. In the current study, steaming of the poultry litter at the 2 longest time points and at each concentration of QL caused a significant reduction of ST (Figures 1 and 2) . The 5-min steam treatment resulted in a reduction (P \u2264 0.05) of ST to undetectable levels at the highest QL concentration of 10.0% (Figure 3 ). It is possible that the temperature and moisture associated with the steam treatment had an additive effect on QL activity (exothermic reaction and increased pH), causing the reduction in ST levels.",

            "text": "There is a need to identify and implement practical alternatives for treating litter to ease ongoing concerns associated with litter reuse and disposal, as well as the incidence of pathogens. Important factors that should be considered after litter treatment include the cost of the litter treatment, litter moisture, chemical properties, and the effect the treatment has on ammonia levels and bird performance in the subsequent flock. Locally available QL costs $137.00/ton. Treating a broiler house containing 100 tons of litter with 2.5% QL would cost $342.50 for the QL alone, not including the cost of the steam treatment. The steamed litter in this study was allocated into five 20-lb (9.07-kg) portions that were placed in a perforated nursery flat. The flats were then placed inside a 2-cubicyard (1.53-cubic-meter) steamer cart and the litter was steam treated. Future studies should be conducted to evaluate the practicality of pasteur- In the current study, production parameters were not evaluated after steam or QL treatment, or both. However, research has been conducted analyzing these parameters in poultry reared on litter treated with QL and hydrated lime. Bennett et al. [2] showed that hydrated lime in the litter at concentrations of 0.2, 1.0, or 5.0% increased BW in turkey poults and significantly reduced overall aerobic bacteria. Additionally, an increase in BW gain was observed at 7 wk of age in turkeys reared in a pen treated with 0.2% hydrated lime. Ruiz et al. [31] showed that broilers reared for 42 d on 10 or 15% QL-treated litter did not develop any breast or footpad blisters, and that there were no negative effects on bird performance (BW, feed consumption, feed conversion, and mortality). Breast and footpad blisters, respiratory diseases, ocular irritation, and discomfort have all been directly correlated with increased ammonia levels in broiler houses [32] . Litter additives, such as monobasic calcium phosphate and phosphoric acid [33] , have reduced litter pH, minimized ammonia volatilization, and limited microbial activity. It is likely that an increased pH level caused by a QL-steam treatment would also have a negative effect on microbial populations that generate ammonia gas that would be similar to the activity of these litter amendments [2] . However, elevated pH levels of the litter, as a result of a QL-steam treatment, will be unable to prevent the liberation of ammonia initially [34] . It has been speculated that reducing uric acid-splitting bacteria would eventually result in reduced generation of ammonia [2] . Additionally, high temperatures and low ventilation rates during the brooding period may cause complications as a result of increased ammonia volatilization, which may result in poor chick quality. Elevated temperatures accelerate bacterial ammonification, gaseous ammonia production, and mass transfer of ammonia from the litter to the rearing atmosphere [34] .",

In the current study, moisture content was determined after the addition of distilled H 2 O and was typically 50 to 62% (data not shown). An increase of 30% (45 to 75%) RH has been shown to cause ammonia levels to increase and become more variable [36] . Increasing ventilation rates could counter this effect, but the increased rates may increase energy costs in a cool environment. Although moisture must be adequate to facilitate an exothermic reaction with QL, Ruiz et al. [31] found that moisture percentage was not affected in litter treated with 10 or 15% QL after a 42-d broiler grow-out. If the QL-treated litter is considered for land application, losses of phosphorus and pathogen runoff are of the greatest concern [10, 31] . Studies conducted by Maguire et al. [10] and Ruiz et al.
