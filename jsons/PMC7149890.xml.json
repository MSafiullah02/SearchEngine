            "text": "Solvent cleaning is a well-established process for removal of surface contaminants in a wide variety of commercial cleaning applications [1]. Many of the conventional solvents used for cleaning, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), are considered detrimental to the environment and are increasingly subject to regulations for reduction in their use, and eventual phasing out of these solvents [2], [3]. As a result, there is a continuing effort to find alternate cleaning methods to replace these solvents. One such alternative is microbial cleaning that takes advantage of naturally-occurring microbes to remove a wide variety of contaminants from various surfaces. Microbial cleaning is part of the broader concept of bioremediation. As the name implies, bioremediation is a natural solution to contamination mitigation. It is technically defined as the accelerated breakdown of organic compounds through the use of natural biological agents such as bacteria, enzymes, or fungi. For carbon-based contaminants (grease and oil), the endproducts are carbon dioxide and water. Bioremediation is a safe, environmentally-friendly way to process many kinds of hazardous waste and is supported by the U.S. EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) as a viable solution for cleanup of oil spills and other contaminants, as well as an alternative to solvent cleaning.",

Product cleanliness levels in precision technology applications are typically specified for particles by size (in the \u03bcm range) and number of particles, as well as for hydrocarbon contamination represented by nonvolatile residue (NVR) in mass per unit area for surfaces or mass per unit volume for liquids [5], [6], [7]. The surface cleanliness levels are based on contamination levels established in industry standard IEST-STD-CC1246E for particles from Level 5 to Level 1000 and for NVR from Level R1E-5 (10 ng/0.1 m2) to Level R25 (25 mg/0.1 m2) [7]. In many commercial applications, the precision cleanliness level is defined as an organic contaminant level of less than 10 \u03bcg of contaminant per cm2, although for many applications the requirement is set at 1 \u03bcg/cm2\n[7]. These cleanliness levels are either very desirable or are required by the function of parts such as metal devices, electronic assemblies, optical and laser components, precision mechanical parts, and computer parts. A new standard ISO 14644-13 has been published that gives guidelines for cleaning of surfaces in cleanrooms to achieve defined levels of cleanliness in terms of particles and chemical classifications [8].",

Fig. 15.1\nshows a lifecycle diagram of the cleaning process. In a typical surface cleaning application, a cleaning solution containing a strong surfactant/degreaser contacts the contaminated surface. The surfactant reduces the interfacial tension between the contaminant and the part surface, and separates the contaminants from the surface. A combination of microbes and nutrients is released into (and now living in) the solution. Nutrients are generally added as part of the cleaning mix to provide emerging microbes with fortification until sufficient amounts of oil and grease have been introduced as carbon sources. The microbes secrete natural enzymes (for example, lipase [fats, oils], amylase [starches], and protease [proteins]), which cleave the molecular bonds and dissociate the hydrocarbon molecules (contaminants, like oil and grease). This action releases carbon as a source nutrient for the microbes. The microbes are activated and begin to digest the oil and grease that are subsequently absorbed through the cell wall and digested further. The contaminants are then carried by the cleaning solution through a filtering device, where particulate matter, such as dirt, paint chips, and other items larger than 50 \u03bcm, are retained.",

However, while the microbes do not participate in surface contaminant removal, over time they will remove any hydrocarbons in the cleaning system. In a conducive, nutrient-rich environment, the bioremediation materials continue to manufacture themselves throughout the contaminated solution, increasing the overall biomass of microbes in an exponential manner until all of the available hydrocarbons are consumed, thus leaving a clean system with a hydrocarbon-free cleaning solution. Bacteria multiply very rapidly. A single cell can grow to 1021 within 24 hours [26]. The clean solution can be recirculated through the system, the cleaning cycle is repeated, and there is no interruption in the cleaning process.",

Typically, a biocatalyst contains a combination of nonionic surfactants and emulsifiers and water, as well as nutrients that are essential to microbial life. The combination of surfactants and emulsifiers acts to break up the hydrocarbon into very small globules to bring it into intimate contact with the microbes. The globules are surrounded by the enzymes, thereby increasing the rate at which they are dissociated and subsequently digested. The biocatalyst significantly increases bioavailable oxygen. This provides a catalyst for the microbes to multiply faster, resulting in more rapid, more complete bioremediation. The by-products of this process (with pure hydrocarbons) are carbon dioxide, water and soluble fatty acids.",

Other surface cleaning applications, such as cleaning of artworks and household cleaning, do not require any special equipment. Microbial parts cleaners are commercially available in several sizes and models [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. Typically, these heated cleaning systems consist of an upper sink and a lower tank, filter assemblies to trap visible particulate matter (for example, sand, grit, dirt and paint chips), power module, onboard diagnostics, recirculating pumps, cleaning nozzles, and a tank aeration system that increases the effectiveness of the microbes. Higher pump pressure also improves the cleaning action. The load capacity of these systems ranges from 20 to 200 kg of parts. These units are best for light-duty manual cleaning of parts similar to conventional solvent sink-top units, although recently a larger capacity system has been introduced for cleaning entire bicycles [34]. This model includes an integrated bike stand with the parts washer.",

Most microbes require a warm environment to survive and continue to digest the hydrocarbons at an optimal level to clean the solution as quickly as possible. Also, warm solution simply cleans better than cold solution.\u2022Aggressive chemicals, such as disinfectants, bleach, solvents, acids or chlorinated substances, should not be added to the cleaning solution as they tend to kill the microbes.\u2022The liquid should be maintained at an optimum level with solutions designed for the unit. If the microbial blend is diluted or the cleaning solution composition is changed, it can severely impact the performance of the system.\u2022The microbes need time to adapt to the type of contaminants being cleaned. If the microbe solution does not clean effectively at first, cleaning performance will improve after the microbes adapt and digest the new contaminants.\u2022Very heavily contaminated parts with excessive greases, oils and liquids should be pre-cleaned. Sudden loading of concentrated oils and grease may harm the microbes.\u2022The filters should be replaced regularly to keep solids from building up at the bottom of the unit and decreasing cleaning performance. The trapped contaminants in the filters can also reach hazardous levels. Replacing the filters can introduce fresh cleaning solution to the existing microbe colony which keeps the system working at an optimum level.\u2022Parts should be dried after cleaning to prevent rusting or oxidation by residual liquid on the surface. A protective film should be applied to the part before storage.\n",

Exposure to the outdoor environment or to uncontrolled indoor environments (temperature and relative humidity) leads to deterioration largely due to atmospheric pollution from a variety of contaminants, including nitrates, sulfates, black crusts, organic matter, and microorganisms [16], [80], [81], [82], [83]. Deterioration is a complex process involving chemical, physical, and biological mechanisms. For example, black salt crusts form on stone surfaces as a result of the chemical and microbial interactions between the atmospheric contaminants (sulfur dioxide forming sulfuric acid), the stone (calcium carbonate reacting with sulfuric acid to form calcium sulfate), and microbes that can form calcium oxalate in the crusts. Dust and dirt combine with the calcium sulfate and oxalate, resulting in the black crust. Several microbial techniques have been proposed and successfully demonstrated for cleaning and restoration of stone buildings, frescoes, marble surfaces, and other objects [84], [85], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94], [95], [96], [97], [98], [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112]. Fig. 15.6\nshows the Stories of the Holy Fathers fresco at the Camposanto Monumental Cemetery in Pisa, Italy before and after treatment for two hours with Pseudomonas stutzeri bacterial strain [99]. The effects of the treatment on the restoration of the fresco are obvious.",

One reason for the spread of infection is incomplete or ineffective disinfection of surfaces. Many viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are resistant to existing conventional surface cleaning agents/disinfectants. A new antibacterial cleaning composition has been developed that contains different enzymes (proteolytic, amylolytic, lipolytic, or cellulolytic, or their mixtures) and microbes (Bacillus or Pseudomonas) together with a surfactant and an aqueous carrier to maintain a minimum 95% catalytic activity at pH range of 5.5 to 13.5 [24]. This solution is effective against several resistant bacterial strains, such as MRSA, VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococci), and GISA (glycopeptide intermediate Staphylococcus aureus), and can be used as a cleaning and disinfecting agent in affected areas. It can also be used for killing or inactivating bacteria, viruses, or fungi to prevent spreading of the contaminants. Variations of this composition can be used for cleaning metal, ceramic, glass and plastic parts, concrete and tile floors, cleaning grease traps, and other household applications. The contaminants that can be removed include carbon deposits, oil, grease, carbohydrates, starch, and meat and dairy products. Beyond cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, it is also critical to prevent the growth of microorganisms using a solution such as a quaternary ammonium and benzothiazole composition [113].",

Similarly, removal of body fluids, tissue, residual organic matter, and biofilm is critical to ensure proper cleaning and subsequent high-level disinfection. In general, these detergent formulations offer faster cleaning cycles at lower temperatures, cost savings by extending the lifetime of the instruments, and reduced risk of infections through indepth cleaning prior to high-level disinfection and/or sterilization [68].",

The benefits of microbial cleaning for these applications are effective cleaning performance at lower temperatures, reduced usage of chemicals such as surfactants, increased lifetime of the equipment due to milder cleaning conditions, targeted removal of different contaminants, and lower safety and health risks.",

Comparing the costs with the use of enzymes (which is a comparable technique in terms of cleaning efficiency and lack of damage to artworks), biocleaning is clearly far less costly because the cost of protease is about 150 Euro/l and the cost of collagenase is about 500 Euro/l [96], [104]. The costs of the microbial cleaning process are also generally comparable with the usual chemical-physical techniques, but the microbial bacterial approach is more convenient in terms of both the short time needed for the biocleaning and the number of treatments (a single treatment of 2 h), as well as the environmental safety of the process (no hazardous chemical waste disposal). The relatively low-cost of microbial cleaning means that its application represents a highly competitive, cost-effective remediation solution for cultural heritage.",

            "text": "Microbial cleaning has been shown to be an effective alternative to conventional solvent cleaning for many applications. The method is based on the affinity for microbes for hydrocarbons which are digested, producing harmless carbon dioxide, water and soluble fatty acids. The microbes are nonpathogenic and are safe to handle and dispose. The process is environmentally-friendly and is less expensive than solvent cleaning, but it is not applicable to high precision cleaning applications. Typical applications include parts washing; oil and grease removal from concrete and other floor surfaces, and from drains and grease traps in manufacturing facilities, hospitals, restaurants, food processing facilities, and similar locations; decontamination; cleaning of historical artworks and structures; cleaning and disinfection in health care facilities; wound debridement; controlling SRB in oil fields; mercury bioremediation; and household and institutional cleaning applications.",
