Virologic confirmation was obtained by direct fluorescent antibody, shell vial centrifugation, or conventional viral culture in lower respiratory tract samples; after 2007 patients also had RSV detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Stored serum or plasma samples were available in a subset of patients.

The RT-PCR assays were performed in duplicate to assess low levels of viral RNA and optimize detection. Thus, a total of 4 RT-PCR results were obtained for each specimen. To ensure that negative results were not due to poor nucleic acid extraction or inhibition of the PCR assay, 1000 copies per reaction of a specimen processing control was added to the lysis buffer during extraction. All negative samples had evidence of amplification of the control. One low-positive control containing 200\u20131000 copies per reaction of RSV and 1 negative control consisting of cultured, uninfected human epithelial cells were processed with each batch of patient specimens. Each assay reliably detected 10 viral copies per reaction, which provided a sensitivity of 200 copies/mL (10 \u00b5L of nucleic acid specimen added per reaction).

The probability of overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method; the probability of mortality due to respiratory failure (pulmonary death) was estimated with cumulative incidence curves, with death from other reasons as a competing risk. The log-rank test was used to compare mortality curves between subgroups. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for RSV RNA detection, and for overall mortality and pulmonary death at day 30 and day 90 following RSV LRD. Poisson regression was used to evaluate unadjusted and adjusted relative risk (RR) for respiratory failure, defined as the requirement for mechanical ventilation. Covariates evaluated as candidate risk factors for inclusion in multivariable models are listed in Table 1. Variables with P \u2264 .2 in univariate analysis were candidates for multivariable models. For model formation, risk factors of interest were selected a priori; factors significant in univariate models at P \u2264 .2 were added one by one to those factors for evaluation. Models presented are those with significant confounding variables. Given the extended study period and the associated changes in transplant practices, year of transplant was evaluated over 2 time periods as well as continuously. Time-dependent steroid use and mechanical ventilation were included in all models for RSV RNA detection. Treatment with ribavirin, oxygen requirement at diagnosis, and cell source were included in all models for overall mortality; treatment with ribavirin and oxygen requirement at diagnosis were included in all models for pulmonary death. Oxygen requirement at diagnosis and presence of RSV RNA were included in all models of respiratory failure. Two-sided P values <.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Separate multivariable models were used to minimize the number of covariates per model due to the limited number of outcome events. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina).\n",

Other risk factors for RSV RNA detection in plasma/serum include neutropenia and monocytopenia, implying that the inflammatory response plays a part in viral containment within the respiratory system. Pathological examinations in autopsy specimens have shown alveolar mononuclear cell infiltration in children with RSV [33], and BAL specimens in children with RSV bronchiolitis have shown that neutrophils comprise >80% of the inflammatory cell infiltrate at the height of clinical symptoms [34]. Furthermore, RSV nucleic acid has been demonstrated in monocytes and neutrophils in BAL and blood specimens in adults and children with RSV infection [24, 25, 35, 36].

We demonstrated that treatment of RSV LRD with aerosolized ribavirin in HCT recipients was consistently associated with decreased probability of overall death and death due to respiratory failure in multivariable models. Although our results suggest a stronger protective effect for aerosolized ribavirin over systemic ribavirin (Supplementary Figures 2A and 2B), the number of patients who received systemic ribavirin in this cohort is small (n = 13) and therefore these results should be interpreted cautiously.",

Palivizumab was not protective in multivariable models, a finding that has recently been analyzed separately in a homogenous cohort of patients who received aerosolized ribavirin [29]. Interestingly, although lymphopenia has been suggested as a risk factor for progression from URD to LRD [4, 12], we did not find lymphopenia to be associated with increased risk for death in patients with established RSV pneumonia.
