A transfer of this infimal convolution approach to the discrete setting was proposed by Setzer et al. [27] . Also Bredies et al. [7] performed research in this direction and introduced a total generalised variation regulariser based on symmetric tensors of varying order. This allows a selective regularisation with different smoothness constraints. More recent coupling models have become highly sophisticated. Hewer et al.

We observe that the smoothness terms in energy (7) and (8) are quadratic. That means that on one hand v is still a smooth approximation to the \u2207u. On the other hand the coupling term contains the sparsity-promoting L 1 norm. As a result, v deviates from \u2207u only at a small number of positions, which are represented as peaks in the energy of the coupling term. Since these peaks correspond to discontinuous jumps in the solution u, we see that the coupling term corresponds to the desired edge set and can naturally be utilised as an edge detector.",

Already first order models that contain a coupling term in the sparsity promoting L 1 norm are sufficient for edge-preserving denoising. For the remaining data and smoothness terms we can use simple quadratic L 2 norms. This does not only simplify the numerical minimisation scheme, it also challenges the common belief that edge-preserving denoising requires a nonquadratic smoothness term. The first order coupling model also shows a theoretical connection to the classical segmentation model of Mumford and Shah. As it works on a strictly convex energy, we obtain an approximation of the Mumford-Shah functional that has a unique solution and is guaranteed to converge. Furthermore, the introduced coupling term itself carries valuable information: It has the properties of a global edge detector that is robust against noise and comes at literally no cost as a byproduct of the minimisation. In our ongoing research we investigate how the coupling formulation can be extended to applications in deblurring or inpainting or in combination with anisotropic regularisation. Moreover, we intend to exploit the simplicity of the quadratic terms by using parallel implementations to gain more efficient solvers.",
