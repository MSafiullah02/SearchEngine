            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly emerging enterotropic swine coronavirus that causes acute enteritis in nursing piglets (Jung et al., 2015; Woo et al., 2012). PDCoV infection is characterized by marked villous atrophy in the small intestine, which results in watery diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and death in newborn piglets (Jung et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015). This disease is symptomatically comparable to, but reportedly milder than, other porcine enteric coronavirus diseases caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), with lower mortality rates in affected neonatal piglets (Hu et al., 2015). PDCoV belongs to the genus Deltacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. PDCoV is a large, enveloped virus possessing a single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA genome of approximately 25.4\u2010kb long with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail, which is the smallest genome size among porcine coronaviruses (de Groot et al., 2011; Woo et al., 2012). The PDCoV genome consists of only six canonical coronaviral genes, except for open reading frame (ORF) 3, in the following conserved order: 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR)\u2010ORF1a\u2010ORF1b\u2010S\u2010E\u2010M\u2010N\u20103\u2032 UTR. ORF1a and 1b occupy the 5\u2032\u2010proximal two\u2010thirds of the genome encoding two overlapping viral replicase polyproteins, 1a and 1ab, which are proteolytically processed into mature non\u2010structural proteins (nsps). The production of polyproteins requires a \u22121 ribosomal frame shift, which C\u2010terminally extends polyprotein 1a into polyprotein 1ab during translation of the genomic RNA. The 3\u2032\u2010proximal last third of the genome codes for the four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), as well as two accessory genes, non\u2010structural gene 6 (NS6) and NS7, located between M and N, and within N, respectively (Lai, Perlman, & Anderson, 2007; Lee & Lee, 2014; Li et al., 2014; Marthaler, Jiang, Collins, & Rossow, 2014; Woo et al., 2012).",

            "text": "PDCoV was first discovered in Hong Kong, China in a territorial surveillance study of coronaviruses in mammals and birds in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012). A PCR\u2010based survey of diarrhoea samples from pigs in mainland China revealed the prevalence of PDCoV across the country since 2012. This study reported that the monoinfection of PDCoV and coninfection of PDCoV with PEDV are most common in pig herds in China (Song et al., 2015). In February 2014, the presence of PDCoV was first announced in Ohio, United States, in conjunction with diarrhoea outbreaks without other aetiologic agents. Molecular surveillance indicated that this novel coronavirus was present in 20 US states and nearly 80% of the tested samples corresponded to cases of co\u2010infection of PDCoV with other enteric viral pathogens such as a rotavirus or PEDV (Li et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015; Marthaler, Jiang, et al., 2014; Marthaler, Raymond, et al., 2014; Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014). Although the origin of PDCoV in the US remains unclear, sequence analyses suggest the possible introduction of a Chinese PDCoV strain into US swine (Li et al., 2014; Marthaler, Jiang, et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). However, recent retrospective evaluation revealed that PDCoV antibodies could be detected in archival serum samples collected in 2010, suggesting that the virus may have already existed as early as 2010 (Thachil, Gerber, Xiao, Huang, & Opriessnig, 2015). Shortly after its emergence in the US, PDCoV was also detected in South Korea from two diarrhoea samples independently collected in April and June 2014, which were positive for porcine rotavirus (PRV) and negative for other enteric viruses, respectively (Lee & Lee, 2014). Genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that the Korean strains are more closely related to the US strains than to the Hong Kong HKU15 strains, suggesting that Korean PDCoV originated from the US (Lee & Lee, 2014). In this study, we aimed to further investigate the prevalence and full\u2010length genome sequence analysis of PDCoV from clinical cases associated with diarrhoea from Korean swine farms.",

The expected sizes of the amplicons from the primer sets are 504 and 289 bp, respectively. Total RNA was extracted using the TGE/PED detection kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, South Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentrations of the extracted RNA were measured using a NanoVue spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The first round of RT\u2010PCR was performed using 1 \u03bcg of RNA, external primers and the HyQ one\u2010step RT\u2010PCR kit (SNC, Hanam, South Korea) according to the manufacturer's protocol under the following conditions: reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, an initial PCR activation step at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 40 s, followed by a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. For nested PCR, the second round of amplification was conducted using 1 \u03bcl of initial PCR product, internal primers and TaKaRa Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) under the following conditions: denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 58\u00b0C for 30 s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min.",

To determine the full\u2010length genomic sequence of the Korean PDCoV isolates, KNU16\u201007 and KNU16\u201011, oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the PDCoV KNU14\u201004 strain (GenBank accession no. KM820765) to obtain RT\u2010PCR fragments. The primers were further synthesized based on KNU14\u201004 sequences for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) experiments and nucleotide sequencing (Table S2). Nine overlapping cDNA fragments spanning the entire viral genome were RT\u2010PCR amplified using gene\u2010specific primer sets as described above. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the PDCoV genome were determined by RACE as described previously (Lee & Lee, 2013). The individual PCR amplicons were gel\u2010purified, cloned into the pGEM\u2010T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), and sequenced in both directions using primers for the T7 and SP6 promoters, as well as PDCoV\u2010specific primers. General procedures for DNA manipulation and cloning were performed according to standard procedures (Sambrook & Russell, 2001). The complete genomic sequences of the KNU16\u201007 and KNU16\u201011 viruses and the S gene sequence of KNU16\u201008 were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers KY364365 and KY926512, and KY926511, respectively.",

            "text": "The family Coronaviridae is included in the order Nidovirales along with the families Arteriviridae, Roniviridae and Mesoniviridae, infecting a broad range of species including humans, other mammals, rodents and birds (Cavanagh, 1997; Mayo, 2002; Siddell & Snijder, 2008; Spaan et al., 2005). Coronaviruses are divided into four genera: Alpha\u2010, Beta\u2010, Gamma\u2010 and Deltacoronavirus, based on the phylogenetic distances of highly conserved domains (Woo et al., 2012). Although birds are the primary reservoirs for gamma\u2010 and deltacoronaviruses, these avian\u2010origin coronaviruses may jump and adapt to some mammalian species including pigs. Indeed, a study to investigate the presence of deltacoronavirus identified a novel PDCoV genome from the faecal samples of pigs in Hong Kong, China in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012). In early 2014, PDCoV was detected and reported in the US and South Korea (Lee & Lee, 2014; Wang et al., 2014). Soon thereafter, the pathogenicity and pathogenesis of this novel virus were elucidated in gnotobiotic and conventional piglets under different experimental conditions (Chen et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2015). In South Korea, pigs have been prone to various diarrhoeic diseases for years, predominantly by PEDV (Lee, 2015; Lee & Lee, 2014). However, little is known regarding whether PDCoV has been involved with outbreaks of diarrhoea at domestic pig farms since its emergence. To provide insight into the epidemiological status of PDCoV in South Korea, it is necessary to develop assays for the detection of this newly emerged enteric virus. In this study, therefore, a nested RT\u2010PCR method for PDCoV detection was established and utilized for a prevalence survey of PDCoV\u2010associated diarrhoeic diseases.",

            "text": "The high prevalence of PDCoV infections in diarrhoeal samples from pigs was confirmed in South Korea, which is similar to the results of two independent studies from the US and China (Marthaler, Raymond, et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015). RT\u2010PCR screening of pig diarrhoeal samples collected from January 2014 to December 2016 revealed the presence of PDCoV monoinfection (9.66%) as well as co\u2010infection with PDCoV/PEDV (6.30%) and PDCoV/PRV (2.78%). Like China, PDCoV/PEDV co\u2010infection was the most common type of co\u2010infection detected in South Korea, rather than PDCoV/PRV co\u2010infection, which was more prevalent in US pig herds (Marthaler, Raymond, et al., 2014). Further study is needed to elucidate the interactions between PDCoV and PEDV or PDCoV and PRV. In the US, PDCoV infection was reported to be associated with significant mortality rates in the field (Ma et al., 2015; Marthaler, Jiang, et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014). Similarly, a recent survey study revealed that a high number of piglet deaths occurring during an outbreak in China involved PDCoV infections and symptoms of severe diarrhoea (Song et al., 2015). In contrast to the US and China, PDCoV infection appears to be less prevalent in South Korea, and PDCoV strains circulating in South Korea may not typically cause the severity and mortality of PDCoV\u2010associated disease. Because PED is the most common enteric disease in South Korea and PDCoV causes clinical signs indistinguishable from those of PEDV, it is possible that PDCoV\u2010induced disease might be neglected and draw less attention for investigation. Some coronaviruses can retain some potential to infect different animal species, and subsequently can be adapted and maintained in the host by exploiting or sharing various cell surface components or other undefined factors (Su et al., 2016). As PDCoV has a non\u2010swine ancestor and is not swine\u2010borne, a potential interspecies transmission of deltacoronavirus may have occurred between wild birds or small mammals and domestic pigs (Ma et al., 2015; Woo et al., 2012). Although pigs may have initially served as a susceptible host, PDCoV may not yet be fully adapted to pigs and appears to continue to undergo genetic drift to become more completely adapted to pigs (Jung, Hu, & Saif, 2017). Intriguingly, the recently identified Korean PDCoV strains contained a unique S INDEL signature at the N\u2010terminus and C\u2010terminus of S, respectively, and several amino acid substitutions have emerged at the external and cytosolic internal domains of the S protein. Moreover, the KNU16 strains were found to be phylogenetically different from other Korean strains, implying that potential adaptation to the natural host may be ongoing.",

As PCR development is not the objective of this study, and PCR is not evaluated, it is not suggested be stated as a stand\u2010alone point in conclusion. A PCR\u2010based survey indicated that PDCoV monoinfection and co\u2010infection with PEDV or PRV were almost equally present in diarrhoeal pigs from South Korea. However, the detection rate of PDCoV in South Korea was lower than that reported in the US and China. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the Korean isolates have a close evolutionary relationship with US strains and that the virus continues to evolve and adapt to its host in the field.",
