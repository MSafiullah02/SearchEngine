For example, through monitoring and surveillance of such drivers, it might be possible to anticipate and mitigate the impact of EIDs, both in public health and financial terms.5, 6, 7, 8 Historically, public health has intervened successfully on a number of risk factors, such as a lack of sanitation and hygiene, poor quality of drinking water, or food safety. More recently, however, many disparate drivers interact with globalization (e.g., international air traffic) and changes in the biophysical environment and global systems (e.g., climate change).9, 10 The interconnected and interdependent nature of these drivers makes it challenging to predict EIDs.11, 12, 13, 14\n",

These IDTEs were detected through epidemic intelligence activities at the ECDC to detect, verify, analyze, assess, and investigate threats to public health.10 The comparability of observed and projected data was enhanced by using the same categories of IDTEs and the same groupings of drivers.",

Vaccine\u2010preventable IDTEs accounted for 68% of all cases (Table 1); therefore, the key drivers in the logistic regression for morbidity were dominated by drivers for vaccine\u2010preventable IDTEs (Table 2). These drivers were related to the characteristics of subgroups in society that lack access to, or abstain from, vaccination. In contrast, the key drivers for deaths were heterogeneous, since the IDTEs responsible for these deaths were also very heterogeneous (Table 2). The impact of the observed IDTEs in Europe is also reflected in the number of countries affected: 42 IDTEs were multicountry outbreaks involving three or more countries, of which 10 IDTEs involved more than eight countries.

One of the striking differences was that the environment and climate change group was projected to be linked only with the vectorborne and rodentborne IDTEs in the foresight study. However, in the observed data, this group was linked to half of all of the IDTEs (the environment and climate change group was split into climate, natural environment, and human\u2010made environment, as discussed above in the Methods section). Thus, global environmental change had been underestimated in the foresight study but was, in fact, a much more significant contributor to the observed IDTEs. This observation was also confirmed in the multiple logistic regression analysis, with globalization and environment contributing to four of the top five drivers: travel and tourism, natural environment, global trade, and climate. The contribution of globalization and environmental drivers to IDTEs might have been underestimated in the foresight study, possibly because these drivers are poorly understood and distal (or upstream) from the health outcome.20 Globalization and environmental drivers might appear to be less amenable to direct interventions during an IDTE (e.g., travel restrictions), in contrast to social and demographic (e.g., social distancing) or public health system (e.g., stockpiling of drugs and vaccines) drivers. As a result, their contribution might have been underestimated in the expert\u2010based foresight study. It is also possible that global environmental change has recently received more media/political attention and is now more readily recognized as a driver of IDTEs in the scientific literature.",

Remotely sensed temperature abnormalities, the state of vegetation and water bodies, and bird migratory routes were found to be predictors of WNF risk in a multivariate model.60 Using this model, short\u2010term projections have been produced with predictive maps of the probability of WNF on the basis of temperature anomalies for July in 2014 and 2015.59 Climate change projections for 2025 reveal a higher probability of WNF outbreaks, particularly at the edges of the current transmission areas, and further expansion by 2050.59 These risk maps can be a useful tool for predicting and managing WNF outbreaks and can be used as early warning systems by using July temperature abnormalities to delineate the geographic range of WNF outbreaks later on in the season;59 public health interventions can then be targeted to areas of increased risk in order to contain or interrupt transmission.",
