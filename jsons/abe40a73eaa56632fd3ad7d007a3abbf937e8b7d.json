ABSTRACT A new betacoronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new threat to global health and economy. A promising target for both diagnosis and therapeutics treatments of the new disease named COVID-19 is the coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein. By constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations and the PROCEEDpKa method, we have mapped the electrostatic epitopes for four monoclonal antibodies and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on both SARS-CoV-1 and the new SARS-CoV-2 S receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins. We also calculated free energy of interactions and shown that the S RBD proteins from both SARS viruses binds to ACE2 with similar affinities. However, the affinity between the S RBD protein from the new SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is higher than for any studied antibody previously found complexed with SARS-CoV-1. Based on physical chemical analysis and free energies estimates, we can shed some light on the involved molecular recognition processes, their clinical aspects, the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 4 implications for drug developments, and suggest structural modifications on the CR3022",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2, virus recently found in Wuhan, Hubei province, China and officially named by the World Health Organization (WHO), 1 has already spread through China from all continents (more than 168 countries), with 1,133,758 confirmed cases globally and 62,784 deaths (data as reported by Central European Time 5 April 2020). Due to the pandemic, the disease is not only affecting the health services, but also the economy in a global scale, interfering in the widespread displacement of people, tourism, local and even international markets. Once China's economy is a worldwide reference, its disruption leads to a global impact in the supply chains and the production itself. [1] [2] [3] The Coronaviridae family, to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs, includes a large variability of viruses and became recognized in the spring of 2003, when a human coronavirus caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). [4] [5] [6] [7] Based on phylogenetic analysis, the SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a lineage B betacoronavirus 8 and belongs to the same group as SARS-CoV-1 and HKU9-1, the bat coronavirus, demonstrating wide similarity with both genetically 9 (96,2% of sequence identity with HKU9-1). 10 The transmission was confirmed to be human-to-human once several medical care personnel and relatives got infected, 8, 9 but it is believed that it all started with an animal host, may it be a bat or another intermediate host. 7, 9, 11, 12 Even though the virus usually does not cause severe damage to the body, as will be explained below, the major concern is its high infectivity and pathogenicity. 8, 12, 13 The COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, 14 generally causes mild upper respiratory tract infections, resulting in fever and cough, yet it can also affect the lower respiratory tract. 12, 15, 16 SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, usually remains asymptomatic in an early stage and then manifests itself with dyspnea, severe pneumonia and even death, 17 with fatality rates of about 10%. 18 Although many groups of researchers are combining their efforts to solve the mysteries of the new virus, some issues are still uncertain. Examples of these queries are the virus' incubation period, that may be longer than the 14 days scientists believed it to be previously, and the fatality rates for each age range. 19 Despite the fact that the virus' molecular mechanism is partially unknown, the SARS-CoV-2 has proteins, such as the Spike (S) glycoprotein, that densely decorates the viral external J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f surface and can potentially be a key target for the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies (Abs). 8, [20] [21] [22] Due to the similarity of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, the first strategy that has been used is to search for Abs that succeed interacting with both, once SARS-CoV-1 has been more widely studied. However, preliminary experimental studies have shown that many Abs that successfully interact with SARS-CoV-1 do not bind with SARS-CoV-2. 8 The spike protein, which is responsible for the -corona\u2016 (Latin word for crown) appearance in all coronaviruses, is a type I glycoprotein that has an especial role in the interaction between the virus and the host cell. This protein attaches itself to specific cellular receptors and suffers a conformational change that enables the fusion of the virus and the cell. 4, 23, 24 Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2's S RBD protein interacts strongly with the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 9, 24, 25 Therefore, aiming to develop better diagnosis tools, vaccines and therapeutic Abs, it was measured the competition of mAbs and the ACE2 for the binding to SARS-CoV-2 (named before 2019-nCoV 8, 26 ) RBD protein in order to enlighten the binding epitopes of these Abs. 8, 19 The focus of this article is to initially reproduce the observations of previous laboratory experiments by a theoretical approach. Secondly, we aim to contribute with the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the SARS viral infection, and finally to show how to apply this knowledge to design new functional molecules. To achieve these goals, it was tested by constant-pH simulation methods the complexation between the S RBD proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with the fragments of the monoclonal Abs (mAbs) 80R, CR3022, m396 and F26G29, measuring their binding affinities and quantifying the titratable amino acids that are involved in these interactions. Thus, using a theoretical method recently proposed to identify -electrostatic epitopes\u2016, 27 it is possible to identify the similarities and differences between these molecular complexes, and to map their origin and possible biological implications.",

A model was built up at the SWISS-MODEL workspace (YP_009724390.1) based on the NCBI reference sequence NC_045512. 47 The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions between this modeled structure for the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f available one for SARS-CoV-1 (PDB id 2AJF) is 0.638\u212b . The structural comparison between the RBD proteins of both SARS viruses can be seen in Figure 1 . This field is evolving so fast that new experimental structures are continuously been solved. For example, a cryo-EM structure is now available for the prefusion S glycoprotein (a homotrimer structure) with an incomplete RBD (PDB id 6VSB, resolution 3.46\u00c5). This study revealed an interesting pivotal movement of the RBD between two transition states (-up\u2016 or -down\u2016 conformations) with direct implications for the binding of ACE2 and/or Abs. 87 At least two monomeric S units need to be at the -up\u2016 conformation and properly rotated to remove the steric hindrance which allows the binding. 87, 88 This implies at least a two-step -expose-dock-like\u2016 mechanism where the RBD has to be exposed towards the solution in the first step (characterized by important conformational adjustments of the whole homotrimeric structure) followed by the bind or dock phase where with the targeted-RBD can interact with other molecules. Here, the focus is at this second step of this mechanism where we assume that a single targeted-RBD structure is at its final state and prepared for the binding with the ligands (i.e. at least two S monomers were already at the -up\u2016 conformation, correctly rotated and there was no clashes between the targeted-RBD with any other parts of the trimeric structure that could prevent the binding). 87, 88 This is the same assumption for the available crystallographic structures (e.g. PDB id 2AJF). The conformational changes between the -up\u2016 and -down\u2016 conformations (the -expose\u2016 phase) are not investigated in this work.",

            "text": "A large diversity of models is available for MD and MC molecular simulations. 38, [49] [50] [51] [52] The need to repeat the calculations on several different physical chemical conditions and to obtain free energy of interactions at them drives the options to the so-called cost-effective coarse-grained (CG) models. These CG models offer the possibility to explore the main physical features of a system with a reduced number of parameters and lower computational costs. 27, 42, 43 During the last years, a fast constant-pH (CpH) CG model has been devised to successfully study proteinprotein interactions of several biological systems (including host-pathogens interactions). 27, 42, 43, 53, 54 The possibility to fully consider the pH effects makes this modeling approach more appealing and appropriated to address this problem. 27, 55 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f A sketch of the simulations model is given in Figure 5 . The S RBD proteins and the fragments of the mAbs were modeled as rigid bodies (i.e. bond lengths, angles, and dihedral angles are kept fixed) formed by a set of amino acids placed at positions given by their three-dimensional structures as described above. This additional approximation is justified by the prohibitive J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f computational costs of constant-pH methods with pH-dependent conformational changes. 52, 56, 57 Moreover, it is known that SARS-CoV-1 S protein does not exhibit large conformational changes upon the binding to ACE2 at least. 58 Each group of atoms that define an amino acid is converted in a single charged Lennard-Jones (LJ) sphere of radius (R i ) and valence z i . This CG process turns a protein atomistic structure as a collection of charged LJ particles representing their amino acids. The centers-of-masses of the beads (mimicking amino acids) are used to place them accordingly to the coordinates given by the three-dimensional structures. The values of R i for each type of amino acids were taken from ref. 53 . The valences of all ionizable residues are a function of the solution pH. The fast proton titration scheme (FPTS) 40, 41, 52 was employed both to initially assign these valences z i\u00b4s for the amino acids and to let them vary during the simulation sampling at a given pH. This method has proved to predict pK a\u00b4s with a very good accuracy at low computational costs. 41 The fundamental physical chemical basis of this titration scheme, its numerical implementation, benchmarks, discussions related to its approximations, pros and cons can be found in previous publications. 40, 41, 52, 59 As illustrated in Figure were represented implicitly using a screening term, i.e., for two ionizable amino acids i and j, the screening is given by [exp(-\u03bar ij )] where \u03ba is the modified inverse Debye length, and r ij is the interparticle separation distance. 27, 42, 43, 60 Additionally, a simplified simulation box with only one protein present was used to characterize the titration properties of a single macromolecule.",

For instance, \u03c3 ij for the pair VAL-GLU is 7.2\u00c5 (= R VAL + R GLU , where R VAL = 3.4\u00c5 and R GLU = 3.8\u00c5see ref. 53 ).

            "text": "The EEs are the core idea of the PROCEEDpKa method 27 where pKa shifts are used to identify the key amino acids responsible for a host-pathogen association. It applies the fact that the location of these shifts is a practical mean to probe molecular interactions as before demonstrated. 67 Moreover, this can be easily measured during computer simulations of a proteinprotein complexation. The predictive properties of this powerful tool have been previously i) statistically analyzed for flaviviruses, ii) compared to other bioinformatic tools (that often ignore that pH and ionic strength can drastically affect the complexation process) and iii) discussed in details in a preceding work. 27 The capacity of this method to test EE for specific mAbs makes it even more appealing for the present study where four known mAbs should be investigated. For the sake of convenience, predicted EE for the studied systems were graphically compared at the sequence level. The pairwise sequence alignments were generated by the server EMBOSS Needle 68 with default settings. were not reported in Tian's work. 8 In contrast to these results, another recent study 20 advocated that SARS-CoV-2 has greater binding affinity for ACE2 than SARS-CoV-1. Even so, both the present theoretical and previously reported experimental data do agree that SARS-CoV-1 S RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S RBD have similar attraction to the ACE2. This high binding affinity implies that all human organs rich on ACE2 (oral and nasal mucosa, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain) 76 Note that the simulations were performed with a single RBD protein in the absence of the full structure of the S protein and the others two chains of the homotrimeric S glycoprotein. This brings with it the evidence that the other structural parts of the S1 subunit, the S2 subunit and the two other chains are not essential for the individual pair of RBD-ACE2 complexation (assuming that the targeted-RBD has no steric hindrance as discussed above). Also, this observation supports the argument that the dissociation of the S1 subunit complexed with ACE2 can happen without the interruption of the infection. This also allows the S2 subunit to transit from a metastable prefusion to its post-fusion state as a second step in the viral infection. 58, 78 At pH 4.6 which is closer to the low pH that occur outside the cell, 23 However, we prefer to interpret such small differences as tendencies of the system. Based on previous studies 27, 42, 43, 54, 60 where we have observed either that the computed complexation was weaker than the experimental measurements or too much stronger, we feel safer to use this data (and the others discussed below) in relative terms (i.e. comparing different situations). This allows us to successfully predict experimental observations respecting the limits of such CG models. 27, 42, 43, 54 The similarities between their free energy minima are relatively amplified at pH 4.6 (??\u03b2w min =0.07 as seen above) in comparison with pH 7.0 where \u03b2w min is \u22121.11 and \u22121.06 (??\u03b2w min =0.05). Both viral S RBD proteins have their affinities to ACE2 slightly raised when pH is increased from the acid to the neutral regime. This somewhat higher binding affinity at neutral pH suggests that the role of pH for RBD proteins constantly under debate at the literature 22, 25, 73, 80 might not be so critical for the infection. It also reinforces the possibility that the viral cell invasion is not a pH-dependent process. Indeed, it seems that pH is more relevant for the next steps to continue the viral infection and not at the first entry level. This possible non pH-depend process might increase the opportunities for the SARS viruses to easily infect cells and therefore to contribute to its high infectivity. This might limit the use of chloroquine as an efficient drug against COVID-19 since its first action is to increase the cell pH. At least a neutral pH solution will not prevent the binding of the RBD to ACE2. On the opposite as it can favor this affinity. Moreover, the work of Tian and co-authors suggested that only for CR3022 it was experimentally measured a reasonable binding. 8 The combination of these information could indicate that a threshold of \u22120.67K B T for \u03b2w min can be used to better refine the theoretical binding predictions of these macromolecular complexations (i.e. all viral protein-protein systems with a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f value of \u03b2w min smaller than \u22120.67K B T are expected to experience binding in vivo at least). Table   S1 summarizes the values of \u03b2w min given between parenthesis. It should be noted that the attraction between the S RBD proteins and ACE2 (\u03b2w min equals to \u22121.02 and \u22120.95 for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, respectively) is always stronger than what was calculated to any studied mAb including to the CR3022 (\u03b2w min equals to \u22120.85 and \u22120.79 for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, respectively) for both SARS viruses (see table S1 ). The same tendency was experimentally verified. 8 It was measured by BLI assay a K D of 6.3 nM for the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f binding of CR3022 to SARS-CoV-2 S RBD which corresponds to a fraction of 0.41 of the K D measured for the binding of ACE2 to the same RBD (K D equals to 15.2nM). 8",

The RBD protein responsible for COVID-19 clearly has more titratable residues interacting with ACE2 than its precursor. This observation suggests that its binding to ACE2 might be less specific than what happens for SARS-CoV-1. As such, the presence of an Ab may not completely block the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-ACE2 interaction. In general, as seen in this for SARS-CoV-2). CR3022 perturbed more titratable groups: 27 for SARS-CoV-1 and 33 for SARS-CoV-2 (22% more). Using a different criterion to determine the epitopes, Yuan and coauthors also observed an increase of 15% in the number of titratable residues at the epitope for SARS-CoV-2. 88 Taking into account what was hypothesized for ACE2 above, this might be an addition contribution to improve the capability of this mAb to interact and inhibit the RBD proteins. In fact, the experimental work of Tian and colleagues 8 do show that the CR3022 binding to SARS-CoV-2 S RBD is not affected by ACE2. This might be the molecular basis for this behavior. We are careful with the use of stronger statements here due to the limitation of the theoretical approach. Several additional issues remain to be further investigated.",

Such diversity of possible conformations might motivate further studies exploring their effects on the theoretical predictions. Additionally, the existence of such set of experimental structures for the complex RBD-CR3022 without the other parts of the S protein (or even the other chains of the S homotrimer) indicates that the missing structural part is not essential for the complexation at the dock phase of this -expose-dock-like\u2016 mechanism. These RMSD values above mentioned for the different chains (~ 0.7\u00c5 for PDB id 6VSB) also indicate that the modeled structure for the SARS-CoV-2 virus as used here is reasonable and within the expected conformational fluctuations from any other structure that could have been chosen for this work. Moreover, an intrinsic assumption here is that an experimental structure obtained at a given and specific physical chemical condition (ionic strength, pH, PEG6000 concentration, etc.) is valid in another condition. 27 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

The choice to simulate at pH 4.6 and 7.0 was motivated by the needs to understand the low and neutral pH conditions (e.g. low pH of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f endosomes). Furthermore, it seems controversial in the experimental works if the acidification is essential or not for uptake of cell-free SARS virus.22,23,25 The exact value of the acid pH condition is unknown. We made a choice to use the pH value of the crystallographic environment more acid among the studied structures (pH 4.6 for PDB ids 2GHW and 6W41).This also made possible to easily investigate the behavior of the systems at intermediate conditions by interpolation from the present outcomes.After the proper equilibration of the simulated molecular systems, long production runs were carried out. Simulations whose focus was on titration properties [Z(pH) and pK a s] required10 8 MC steps. Conversely, runs to measure the free energy of interactions [??w(r)] were calculated from radial distribution functions [??w(r)=-ln g(r), where ??=1/k B T] that demanded even longer runs with at least 3.0 10 9 MC steps. These are massive simulations and very costly in terms of cpu time even at the CG representation. Four main factors contribute with this high cpu costs: a) the free energy barriers of the systems; b) the electrostatic coupling between a large number of titratable groups; c) the need to populate all the histogram bins used for the g(r) during the sampling; d) the reduction of the statistical noises in the calculated ??w(r). 27,42,43 Standard deviations were controlled by means of the use of 5 replicates per simulated system as done before for the study of flaviviruses. 27Electrostatic Epitopes determined by the PROCEEEDpKa methodAntibody-antigen recognition is a challenger and intensive research field.27,[64][65][66] It is a molecular process that involves different physical intermolecular interactions.

Several studies have shown that both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses share the function interaction with this cell receptor (i.e. ACE2).7,25,73,74 We investigated the association pathway for the binding of the S RBD proteins to ACE2 for both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses by means of constant-pH MC simulations at two different solution pH values (4.6 and 7.0). The calculated free energy of interactions as given by the potentials of mean force [\u03b2w(r)] for these studied pH conditions at physiological ionic strength are given atFigure 6. Despite similar binding affinities observed in the present theoretical calculations (as seen in and in the laboratory experiments, 8 the SARS-CoV-1 S RBD protein has a small tendency to bind to the ACE2 at both pH regimes. This agrees quite well with the experimental results measured by the biolayer interferometry binding (BLI) assay as reported by Walls and coauthors using the functional subunit of the S protein responsible for binding to the host cell receptor.24 The measured binding affinity (K D ) was 5.0\u00b10.1nM for the system SARS-CoV-1 S RDB(also referred to as the domain B 58 )-ACE2 and 1.2\u00b10.1nM for the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-ACE2. Yet, other experimental measurements using the S1 domain (this is the subunit that contains both the RBD and the N-terminal domain58 ) might suggest an inverted behavior where SARS-CoV-2 S1 domain would have a tendency for a stronger bind to ACE2 (K D =15.0\u00b10.1nM)75 in comparison to SARS-CoV-1 S (K D =15.2nM)8 .

Following the work of Tian and collaborators,8 we investigated the interactions between the two SARS S RBD proteins with some of the most potent SARS-CoV-1 S RBD specific neutralizing antibodies (80R, F26G19, m396, CR3022).Figure 7shows the free energy profiles at the acid regime and physiological salt conditions. For all studied fragments of Abs, a relatively stronger attraction is always observed for the S RBD protein from the SARS-CoV-1 interacting with any of these mAbs.

The lowest observed binding affinities are observed for the system SARS-CoV-2-F26G19 (blue dashed line, \u03b2w min =\u22120.63) followed by SARS-CoV-2-80R errors. The most promising complexation was found for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-CR3022 (red dashed line, \u03b2w min =\u22120.79) which is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. 8 In fact, this was the only mAb that could bind potently with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (K D of 6.3 nM determined by BLI assay) in the experiments performed by Tian and co-authors using the Ab isolated from the blood of a convalescent SARS patient. 8 This cross-reactivity binding between SARS-CoV-1 and 2 of CR3022 has been confirmed by other recent experimental studies. 88 Nevertheless, CR3022 could not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in the experimental in vitro study (which does not exclude the possibility for in vivo neutralization). 88 The Ab m396 only showed an insignificant binding at the highest measured concentration of 2\u03bcM in the experimental studies. 8 Using the free energy minima values observed in the simulations, we can order the binding affinities for the RBD proteins from the lower to the higher as SARS-CoV-2-F26G19 (\u03b2w min =\u22120.63) < SARS-CoV-2-80R (\u03b2w min =\u22120.66) < SARS-CoV-2-m396 (\u03b2w min =\u22120.67) = SARS-CoV-1-F26G19 (\u03b2w min =\u22120.67) < SARS-CoV-1-m396 (\u03b2w min =\u22120.71) < SARS-CoV-1-80R (\u03b2w min =\u22120.73) < SARS-CoV-2-CR3022 (\u03b2w min =\u22120.79) < SARS-CoV-1-80R(\u03b2w min =\u22120.85).

Comparing the number of ionizable residues involved in the interactions for the RBD proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and ACE2 with the pair SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-ACE2, we can see an increase from 30 to 40 with a high number of common cases (22 amino acids) where the same amino acid interacts with ACE2 for both viral proteins.
