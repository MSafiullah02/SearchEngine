Variations in host range and tissue tropism of coronaviruses are attributed to the spike (S) glycoprotein (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). This protein is cleaved by an intracellular protease into two functional domains (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). The S1 subunit is peripheral and responsible for virus binding to host-cell receptors (Kubo et al., 1994), induction of neutralizing antibodies (Yoo and Deregt, 2001), and haemagglutination activity (Schultze et al., 1991). The S1 sequence is variable, and mutations in this region have been associated with altered antigenicity and virus pathogenicity (Fazakerley et al., 1992, Ballesteros et al., 1997). The sequence of the S2 subunit is more conserved and this subunit is responsible for cell membrane fusion activity (Yoo et al., 1991). The S1 gene has been exploited as a target to study the molecular epidemiology of BCoV infection (Hasoksuz et al., 2002a, Jeong et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2006).",

Infection has a high morbidity but a low mortality (Alenius et al., 1991, Saif, 2004). Outbreaks typically occur in autumn and winter, probably in association with housing, but severe outbreaks in adult cattle have been reported in summer (Park et al., 2006, Decaro et al., 2008a). Economic losses can be heavy due to a marked reduction in milk yield (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 2001, Saif, 2010). Calf diarrhoea and respiratory disease also cause significant losses (Svensson et al., 2003, Torsein et al., 2011), but the role of BCoV in these diseases has not been fully evaluated.",

As there were no records of animals purchased from Italy, it is unlikely that the virus was introduced to Sweden by transportation of animals directly from Italy. There have, however, been animals exported from Sweden to Central and Southern Europe in recent years. Samples sequenced from other European countries are needed in order to trace the origin and/or spread of Swedish strains and molecular analysis of future BCoV outbreaks from different parts of the world will increase the understanding of BCoV epidemiology, e.g. direct and indirect transmission routes between herds, regions or even countries.",
