The lifespan of Bos is 18-25 years in the wild and as cattle are valuable livestock that form an important part of food security, bovine research is important for livestock management. Furthermore cows fall under a group of long-lived mammals that display considerable cancer resistance [2]. With considerably long life spans and unusual immunological characteristics cows may hold information for molecular pathways underlying such physiological traits. The bovine immune system has received considerable attention in the medical field due to its unique immunoglobulin traits, including exceptional ability to reach recessed viral epitopes on enveloped viruses. Therefore, a particular research focus has been on their unusual ultralong CDR3H \u201ccattlebodies\u201d, which are being developed for immunotherapy, including against retroviral infections such as HIV [3,4,5].",

            "text": "Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are phylogenetically conserved calcium-dependent enzymes which cause an irreversible post-translational conversion of arginine to citrulline in target proteins. This modification causes structural, and sometimes functional, changes of target cytoskeletal, cytoplasmic, mitochondrial and nuclear proteins, including loss or gain of function or denaturation. Deimination can furthermore cause the generation of neo-epitopes and affect gene regulation [6,7,8,9,10,11]. This post-translational modification is most effective on beta-sheets and disordered proteins [7] and can also facilitate protein moonlighting, where one polypeptide can exhibit multifaceted functions that are physiologically relevant. As this is an evolutionarily acquired phenomenon, moonlighting facilitated by post-translational changes, such as deimination, may contribute to protein\u2019s diverse and conserved functions throughout phylogeny [12,13]. PADs are identified throughout phylogeny from bacteria to mammals. In mammals, five tissue specific PAD isozymes with deimination activity are described, three in chicken and alligator, one in bony and cartilaginous fish [6,14,15,16,17], and PAD homologues (arginine deiminases, ADI) in parasites [18], fungi [19] and bacteria [20,21]. While in Bos taurus five PAD isozymes have been reported: PAD1 (NP_001094742.1), PAD2 (NP_001098922.1), PAD3 (XP_010800991.1), PAD4 (NP_001179102.1) and PAD6 (XP_002685843.1), few studies, besides assessment of cattle PAD ability to deiminate human myelin basic protein [22] and inhibitory effects of paclitaxel on PAD activity in bovine brain extract [23], have hitherto been carried out on PAD protein function, or on putative physiological relevance for PAD-mediated post-translational deimination in cattle.",

            "text": "PADs play important roles in a range of pathologies, including chronic, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as in cancer [9,10,11,24]. PADs also play roles in hypoxia and CNS regeneration [25,26,27,28,29], and PAD-mediated mechanisms have been related to ageing [30,31]. Importantly, PADs have also been implicated in infection, including sepsis, endotoxemia [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39], in antibiotic resistance [21] and other anti-pathogenic responses, including anti-viral ones [37,40,41]. Roles for anti-viral responses via PAD-mediated neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) have furthermore been identified in cattle respiratory syncytial virus disease, via the detection of deiminated/citrullinated histone H3 [42]. Roles for PADs in tissue remodeling and immunity have also recently been described [15,16,43]. PADs have furthermore been identified as phylogenetically conserved key regulators of cellular extracellular vesicle (EV) release [21,44,45,46]. EV-mediated cellular communication is a phylogenetically conserved phenomenon [47], with EVs transferring cargo proteins and genetic material characteristic of the cells of origin [11,48,49,50,51]. As EV cargo is comprised of a large range of proteins, enzymes and genetic material, and as EVs can easily be isolated from a range of body fluids, including serum and plasma, EV signatures can be useful biomarkers [52,53].

Studies on EVs in cattle have been in relation to host-pathogen interactions [58,59,60,61], including in bovine respiratory disease [62,63] and in response to infection [64,65], as well as for export of viral proteins [66,67,68]. EV research in cattle has furthermore been in relation to the estrous cycle, fertility and reproduction [56,69,70,71,72,73,74], as well as for roles during embryonic development [75,76,77,78]. Bovine milk EVs have been assessed for biological activities [79,80,81,82,83], for the application of milk EVs as safe drug delivery vehicles [84,85,86], as well as assessment of viral transfer via milk to calves [87]. Bovine milk EVs have also been investigated as an anti-inflammatory treatment in autoimmune disease [88,89] and in necrotizing enterocolitis [90]. Cattle EVs have furthermore been investigated in relation to neurological disease, including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) [54]. ",

In the current study, post-translationally deiminated protein signatures were assessed in serum and serum-EVs of Bos taurus. We report for the first time post-translational deimination of key immune, metabolic and nuclear proteins in cattle, and identify differences in KEGG pathways enriched for deiminated proteins in serum-EVs compared to whole serum. Our findings provide novel insight into the unusual immunological traits of cattle, including a new angle on their unusual anti-viral activity. Our findings further current understanding of protein moonlighting via deimination in physiological and immunological pathways, underlying anti-pathogenic responses throughout phylogeny.",

Protein interaction networks were based on known and predicted interactions and represent all deiminated proteins identified in serum (Figure 4), all deiminated proteins identified in EVs (Figure 5) as well as deiminated proteins identified in serum only (Figure 6) or in EVs only (Figure 7), or common deimination candidates in EVs and serum (Figure 8). The PPI enrichment p-value for all deiminated proteins identified in bovine serum (based on protein identifier sequences) was found to be p < 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221216 and for all deiminated proteins identified in the serum-derived EVs, the PPI enrichment p-value was also found to be p < 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221216 (Figure 4 and Figure 5). For deiminated proteins identified in serum only (but not EVs) the PPI enrichment p-value was also p < 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221216 (Figure 6), while for deiminated proteins identified specifically in EVs, the PPI enrichment p-value was p = 4.83 \u00d7 10\u22128 (Figure 7). For common proteins found deiminated in serum and in serum-EVs, the PPI enrichment p-value was p < 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221216 (Figure 8). This indicates that in all cases, the identified protein networks have significantly more interactions than what would be expected for a random set of proteins of similar size, based on information drawn from the genome.

It must be noted that neither anti-human PAD1 nor PAD6 antibodies were tested against bovine sera in the current study. The anti-human antibodies have previously been shown to cross-react with PADs from diverse taxa, with PAD2, which is considered the phylogenetically most conserved isoform, predominantly cross-reacting best with other species, including bony and cartilaginous fish, birds, mole-rat, alligator, camelids, cetaceans and pinnipeds [15,16,17,92,93,96,97,98,99].

Overall, the hit for deiminated proteins was higher in the serum-EVs, with a total hit of 179, compared to 118 in serum. Upon assessment of protein\u2013protein interaction networks using STRING analysis, the PPI enrichment p-value for all deiminated proteins identified in bovine serum and serum-EVs, as well as for deiminated proteins identified either in serum or EVs only, indicated that the identified protein networks have significantly more interactions than expected for a random set of proteins of similar size, drawn from the genome, and that the proteins are at least partially biologically connected, as a group (Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8). When assessing KEGG pathways for deiminated proteins relating to infection and immunity, diseases and metabolism, a number of pathways overlapped between serum and serum-EVs, while KEGG pathways only found in EVs related to HIF-1 signalling, oestrogen signalling and biosynthesis of amino acids. KEGG pathways specific for serum only related to Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection, transcription misregulation in cancer, bladder cancer, Rap1 signalling pathway, calcium signalling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction. This indicates differences in cell-communication via export of deiminated proteins in serum-EVs (Figure 3B).",

            "text": "KEGG pathways in common with both serum and serum-EVs related to a number of immunological pathways including the complement and coagulation cascade, bacterial infection, parasitic infection and importantly viral infections, as well as viral myocarditis. The role for deimination of immunoglobulins may be of considerable importance, particularly in relation to enveloped viruses as identified in the current study via deiminated KEGG pathways highlighted for Epstein\u2013Barr virus in cow serum. Deimination in this KEGG pathway has also recently been identified in aggressive glioblastoma cells [100], and the relationship between viral infection cancers still remains to be fully understood [101,102]. In the cow, a link between viral infections and cancer has also been made [103,104,105]. Furthermore, oncolytic viruses from cow, such as bovine herpesvirus type 1, have been considered for application as a human broad spectrum cancer therapeutic [106]. The cow is known for its unusual immune responses and is a model organism for studying neutralizing antibodies against viral infections, including HIV [3,4,5]. Understanding of immune responses against enveloped viruses is of pivotal importance as indeed coronaviruses (CoVs) including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19, also fall under enveloped viruses. CoVs are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with a nucleocapsid, and the structure of the envelope has a crucial role in virus pathogenicity as it promotes viral assembly and release [107]. While a range of studies has focused on modelling the envelope proteins, post-translational deimination has not yet been investigated in relation to SARS and CoVs, while it has been previously identified to play roles in rhinovirus infection [41]. Therefore, the roles for post-translational modifications via deimination may play some roles in structural interactions with the virus, particularly as cow immunoglobulins were here identified as deimination candidates, both in serum as well as in serum-EVs, and cow antibodies with an extended knob structure formed from the third complementarity determining region of the heavy chain are known to bind bovine and human pathogens and be capable of remarkably broad viral neutralization [3,4,5,108]. Post-translational deimination of cow Ig\u2019s, which are reported in the current study for the first time, have yet to be further explored. Roles for PADs in anti-viral responses have previously been identified via the generation of NETosis [37], which can be PAD-mediated and is also a recognized mechanism in anti-pathogenic functions in cattle [109]. Deimination has also been identified to modulate chemokines in anti-HIV responses [40] and higher levels of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies have been found sera of HIV patients [110]. Higher amounts of cyclic citrullinated peptides in sera have indeed been related to infectious diseases including a number of viral, bacterial and parasitic infections [111]. The ability of PAD homologues in bacteria, for example bacterial arginine deiminase in Mycoplasma arginini, a Gram-negative bacterium, has furthermore been shown to act as an effective anti-viral agent against HIV [112]. Interestingly, a recent comparison of transcriptomics data between healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients\u2019 lung biopsies (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA615032), reveals a 6-fold downregulation of PAD4 mRNA level, assessing 17 SARS-CoV-2 versus 106 healthy individuals. This highlights importance for PADs in virus host-pathogen interactions, including in COVID-19. Only PAD4 was reported in this COVID-19 patient cohort. Importantly, as PAD4 is involved in gene regulation and also considered one key-driver of NETosis [37], reduced PAD4 levels, observed in these COVID-19 patients, may contribute to less defences against viral infection due to gene regulatory changes, changes in deimination of immune related proteins, or impaired NETosis in these individuals. Whether the virus manipulates PAD4 expression, as an immune evasion mechanism, or whether individuals with lower PAD4 are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection, remains to be further investigated. Myocarditis is furthermore one of the hallmarks of COVID-19 [113] and roles for deimination/citrullination have previously been identified in a murine model of coxsackievirus B3-induced viral myocarditis [114]. As viral myocarditis was here identified as a KEGG pathway for deiminated proteins in cow sera and serum-EVs, to what extent PADs and deimination could be involved in viral induced myocarditis, including in relation to COVID-19, may be of considerable interest and remains to be further investigated.

            "text": "The complement and coagulation cascades were identified as a common KEGG immune pathway enriched in deiminated proteins in cow serum and serum-EVs. The complement system bridges innate and adaptive immunity, has roles in clearing apoptotic and necrotic cells and is in the front line for clearing invading pathogens [115,116,117,118,119]. Dysregulation of the complement system is furthermore associated with a range of pathologies [120]. In the current study a range of proteins from the complement cascade were identified as deiminated in cow serum and serum EVs, with complement components identified both in serum and serum-EVs including C1q, C3, C4A, C5a, C7, C8, C9 factor B, Factor H, C4-binding protein; while complement components found deiminated only in whole serum were C6, clusterin, and collectin-43 (CL43). C3 is the central component of the complement cascade and has furthermore been implicated in tissue remodeling during teleost ontogeny [121,122,123,124] as well as in regeneration [125]. A range of complement proteins have recently been identified by our group to be deiminated in a range of taxa throughout the phylogenetic tree including teleost and cartilaginous fish, camelids, cetaceans, pinnipeds, camelids and peglagic seabirds [16,17,91,92,93,94,95,96,98,99]. The bovine complement system [126] has been widely studied, including in immune defences against bovine anaplasmosis [127], in relation to heat-stress in dairy cows [128], susceptibility to bacterial infection relating to copper-deficiency [129]. Roles for modulation of complement regulation in relation to poxviral and pestiviral infections have been identified [130,131,132], including immune evasion by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) [133], while and roles for antibody-dependent complement-mediated killing of mycoplasma have recently been revealed [134]. The finding of deiminated complement components highlight hitherto understudied roles for post-translational deimination in the known diversity of complement function throughout phylogeny [135,136,137,138,139]. Furthermore, immune evasion of bacteria (Gingivalis) by deimination of the host\u2019s C5a has previously been identified [20] and indeed C5a was here identified as a deimination candidate in cow serum. Our findings suggest that protein deimination may play hitherto unidentified roles in the known unusual anti-pathogenic functions of cow serum, including via EV-transport, also contributing to complement function in homeostatic processes.

Alpha-2-macroglobulin is related to the other thioester-containing proteins, complement proteins C3, C4 and C5, and is a phylogenetically conserved protein from arthropods to mammals [115,141,142]. The deimination of alpha-2-macroglobulin has recently been identified by our group in teleost fish, camelid, alligator and birds [15,92,93,99]. In the cow, alpha-2-macroglobulin has been widely studied and has amongst other binding affinities to TGF-beta and a range of cytokines [143] While alpha-2-macroglobulin is a known glycoprotein, less is known about deimination and such post-translational modification may facilitate protein moonlighting contribute both to its conserved immunological, as well as multifaceted functions in a range of taxa.",

It is an iron-binding protein with multifaceted functions in development and immunity [144,145]. Serotransferrin is found both in plasma and mucosal tissue and has important roles in anti-pathogenic responses across phylogeny, including in cattle, by withdrawing iron from pathogens including bacteria, fungi and viruses [146,147,148,149]. Furthermore, some viruses, including zoonitic ones, have been identified to utilize human transferrin receptor for viral entry and infection [150,151]. In chronic disease, for example lung diseases, the dysregulation of iron homeostasis can facilitate viral respiratory infections and secondary bacterial infections [152]. Deimination of serotransferrin has previously been identified by our group in teleost serum and mucosa [15,16]. Therefore, its deimination identified here in cow indicates that serotransferrin is deiminated in several taxa and this may be of considerable importance in its immune responses to a range of pathogens throughout phylogeny, as well as with respect to a range of human diseases and infections.",

The gut associated lymphoid system in the intestinal mucosa produces the highest level of antibody-secreting (IgA) plasma cells in the body [153,154]. It has been established that IgA cells play roles beyond antibody production, including having monocytic potential and antimicrobial properties via rapid secretion of cytokines as well as acting as regulators of inflammation [153]. IgA production in the gut mucosa plays major roles in maintaining the integrity of the mucosa and is therefore imperative for the host\u2019s homeostasis and survival [154]. IgA is also produced in the BALT of the respiratory mucosal system [154] and is therefore important in defences against respiratory infections, including viral infections and this has also been identified in cattle bovine respiratory syncytial virus [155]. Deimination has been related to mucosal immunity in teleost fish, including in response to bacterial immune challenge and in EVs mediated mucosal immunity [15,16]. Roles for deimination in the regulation of intestinal immune networks for IgA production identified here may be of considerable interest and remain to be further investigated.",

            "text": "Various immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins and Ig superfamily members were identified here to be deiminated in cow serum and serum-EVs, confirming that Ig\u2019s can be exported via EVs. Ig\u2019s identified both in serum and serum-EVs were immunoglobulin lambda-like and immunoglobulin heavy chain constant mu. Ig\u2019s identified in addition as deiminated in serum only, were the immunoglobulin J (joining) chain responsible for dimeric IgA and pentameric IgM and the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) that facilitates IgA\u2019s translocation from the lamina propria through intestinal epithelia to the lumen. This is the first report of deiminated Ig\u2019s in bovine serum and serum-EVs. Previous studies have identified that cow plasma EVs contain immunoglobulin J chain [55], but this did not come up as a deimination candidate in EVs, only in whole serum in the current study, and therefore may not be exported in EVs in the deiminated form. We have previously confirmed post-translational deimination if Ig\u2019s in several other taxa, including shark, camelid, alligator and birds [17,92,93,99], as well as in teleost fish [15,16], and furthermore reported EV-mediated transport of Ig\u2019s in shark and camelid [17,92]. Ig\u2019s are key molecules in adaptive immunity and studied in diverse taxa. Post-translational deimination of Ig\u2019s and roles in Ig functions remain to be further investigated but have been related to the IgG Fc region in bronchiectasis and RA [156]. Current understanding of Ig diversity throughout the phylogenetic tree is still incomplete [157,158,159,160,161,162]. Therefore, our identification of deimination of Ig\u2019s in diverse taxa, including in bovine Ig\u2019s in the current study, highlights a novel phylogenetically conserved concept of the diversification of Ig\u2019s via this post-translational change. Our reported findings may furthermore shed some light on the unusual immune responses in bovine sera, relating to their immunoglobulins.",

            "text": "Serpins (serine proteases) were identified both in serum and serum-EVs, with both common candidates in serum and EVs as well as some specific serpin targets deiminated in serum or EVs. Serpins have multifaceted roles, ranging from protease inhibition to transport of hormones as well as regulation of chromatin organization [163]. Anti-viral roles for serine proteases have been identified in the airway, and serine proteases have been identified as drug targets for respiratory diseases, including virus infections [164,165]. Bovine serpins are cross-class inhibitors and shown to be strongly active against trypsin, as well as regulating caspases, therefore playing important roles in control of apoptosis in mammals [166]. In cow, serine proteases are for example involved in defences against Babesia bovis, a tick-borne and major apicomplexan pathogen in the cattle industry worldwide [167]. Serpins are identified in a range of taxa and for example serpin based peptides from alligator have been assessed as antimicrobials against multi-drug resistant pathogens [168]. Interestingly, serpins have been identified to be deiminated in alligator, and furthermore in humans, where deimination has been related to the modulation of protease activity and downstream effects on serpin-regulated pathways in rheumatoid arthritis [169]. As deimination of serpin pathways seems therefore a conserved phenomenon in a range of taxa, including in cattle as observed here, such post-translational regulation via deimination may contribute to its various functions, relating to immunity and anti-pathogenic defences, as well as also autoimmune diseases, and this remains to be further investigated.

            "text": "Fat digestion and absorption was identified as a KEGG pathway in both cow serum and serum-EVs alongside adiponectin as a specific target. The adipocytokine signalling pathway has key regulatory roles in metabolism and glucose regulation [170,171,172,173] and is linked to a range of pathologies, including type II diabetes and insulin resistance [174], to myopathies [175] and cancer [176]. Adiponectin has also been linked to longevity [177] and to regenerative functions [178]. In the cow, adiponectin is a known glycoprotein and has been assessed in bovine tissues as well as body fluids [179] and amongst other been identified as a pro-survival signal in ER stress in the mammary gland [180]. Adiponectin has recently been identified as a deimination candidate in several taxa with unusual metabolism, including camelids, the naked mole-rat, orca and alligator [92,93,96,98]. A range of apolipoproteins was furthermore identified to be deiminated in the current study in cow serum and serum-EVs. In cattle, apolipoprotein B-100, apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein C-III have previously been identified as biomarkers for fatty liver and related diseases [181]. In other taxa, apolipoproteins have also been found to display antimicrobial activity against a range of pathogenic bacteria [182,183,184,185] as well as against viral (HIV) replication [186]. Various apolipoproteins have recently been identified as deimination protein candidates by our group in several taxa [15,16,92,93,99]. The deimination of apolipoproteins therefore needs further investigation in relation to their multifaceted phylogenic immune and metabolic functions.",

It is a plasma glycoprotein, mainly secreted from liver but also other tissues and contains most of the selenium in mammalian plasma [187,188,189]. In the cow roles for selenoproteins in mammary gland physiology and in milk formation have been identified [190] and roles for responses to oxidative stress in bovine arterial endothelial cells have also been suggested [191]. It has antioxidant properties [188] and serves in homeostasis and distribution of selenium [189]. Roles for selenoproteins in the regulation of the contraction and relaxation of bronchiolar smooth muscle have furthermore been identified [192]. Sepp1 is known to be glycosylated, and recently it has been identified as a deimination candidate in cetaceans, pinnipeds and alligators [93,96,97]. The contribution of deimination in the functional diversity and conserved functions of Sepp1 throughout phylogeny will remain to be further investigated.",

ECM-receptor interactions play both direct and indirect roles in controlling multifaceted cellular activities, such as cell differentiation, migration and proliferation as well as cell adhesion and apoptosis [193]. ECM-receptor interaction KEGG pathways have been identified in cancer [193] and enrichment for this pathway has been reported mesenchymal stem cell EVs [194]. Regulation of ECM-receptor interactions via post-translational deimination has recently been identified by our group via enrichment of deiminated proteins in KEGG pathways for ECM-receptor interactions in the fin whale, a long-lived cancer-resistant animal [96], in the alligator, an animal with unusual antibacterial and anti-viral responses [93], in the wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans), also an unusually long-lived bird for an avian species [99], as well as in aggressive brain cancer cells [100]. In the cow, ECM-receptor interactions are amongst other related to depot-specific adipogenesis [195] and found to be over-represented in specific cattle breeds [196]. ECM-receptor interaction pathway has furthermore been identified in Holstein cattle in relation to adaptive immune responses following viral vaccination [197] and in intra-mammary infection with Streptococcus agalactiae [198]. Therefore, deimination in this pathway may be of significant importance in anti-bacterial and anti-viral responses. Deimination in ECM-receptor interaction pathway is here described for the first time in cow and may play roles in the multifaceted functions of this pathway. ",

Calcium is a key modulator in a range of immunological, metabolic and developmental functions [199,200,201,202]. Calcium signalling is linked to a wide range of physiological and pathological processes [203,204,205], is a key driver for post-translational deimination [206,207,208] and plays an important role in the regulation of EVs [11,48]. In cattle, calcium is linked to many immunological pathways including inflammatory diseases [209], virus replication [210], parasitic infection [211], wound healing [212], reproduction [213,214] and adrenal function [215]. Interestingly, calcium regulation has been shown to differ between Holstein and Jersey cows, including via serotonergic stimulation of the calcium pathway [216]. The identification in the current study of enrichment in deiminated proteins in the calcium signalling pathway in cow serum indicates a regulatory function in multiple key pathways of physiological and pathological processes via this post-translational modification.

It belongs to a superfamily of small GTPases, with pleiotrophic regulatory functions in cellular processes, such as nuclear transport, cell cycle progression, vesicle trafficking, cell adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangement [217]. Rap1 is an inflammatory regulator, is highly expressed in platelets and is a key molecule for platelet activation and adhesion in injury [218,219]. In mammals, Rap1 is a phylogenetically conserved telomere-interacting protein and promotes endothelial barrier function and angiogenesis [220,221], as well as being involved in cancer cell invasion and metastasis [222]. Rap1 also has roles in oxidative stress and metabolism, and besides cancer it is linked to metabolic and cardiac disorders, including cardiomyopathy [217] as well as Kabuki syndrome (characterised by congenital anomalities and developmental delay) [223]. Rap1 has also been linked to bone growth, including in bovine chondrocyte models [224]. Rap1 has been identified to undergo post-translational modifications by phosphorylation, geranylgeranylation or guanine nucleotide exchange factors [225], but deimination in this pathway has not been identified before, to our knowledge. To what extent deimination contributes to the multifaceted functions of Rap1 signalling in health and disease may therefore be of considerable interest.",

Furthermore, roles for HIF have been identified in bacterial infections [235] and a link between pathogenic agents and cancer has been identified, as viruses, bacteria and parasites may deregulate HIF-1 signalling associated cancer cells [238]. In cows, HIF-1 has for example been found to play roles in immune responses against Theileria annulata, a protozoan parasite of major economically importance for the cattle industry [239]. HIF-1 has also been identified to be important in angiogenesis and the maintenance of capillary structures for final follicle maturation in the cow ovary [240]. Furthermore, HIF-1 has recently been identified as a genomic marker differing between cattle breeds, including highland-adapted cattle [241]. Interestingly, enrichment in deiminated proteins in KEGG HIF-1 signalling pathways has previously been identified in EVs only, in some species with unusual immune and metabolic function including the naked mole-rat and deep-diving whales, both of which are animal models of hypoxia-tolerance and cancer-resistance [96,98]. Furthermore, deimination of HIF-1 regulation were recently identified in aggressive brain cancer (glioblastoma) cells [100]. To what extent deimination regulates HIF-1 signalling in relation to cancer, inflammation and infectious disease, including in cattle, remains to be further investigated.",

Deiminated histone H3 is commonly used as an indicator for neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) [31,244], which has been related to PAD4 and implicated in anti-viral responses in cattle respiratory syncytial virus disease [42], in response to parasitic infections in cattle [245,246,247] as well as in response to certain antibiotics [248]. Interestingly, in crocodilians, extracellular histones H2A and H4 have been identified to act as inhibitors of viral (HIV) infection in vitro [249], although roles for post-translational deimination were not assessed. Anti-microbial effects for histones have furthermore been observed in teleost fish mucosal immunity for H2A [250] as well as for deiminated histone H3 [15]. Histone H3 deimination has furthermore been linked to inflammatory and hypoxic responses during CNS regeneration in avian and murine models [25,26]. Histone deimination is also a known epigenetic mechanism in cancer [11,231,233]. The multifaceted functions of histones in immunity, including via post-translational regulation, such as deimination identified here, remains to be further investigated in cattle, including in relation to possible roles in anti-viral and other anti-pathogenic or disease related responses.

Our findings indicate differences in physiological and pathological pathways for deiminated proteins in serum-EVs, compared with whole serum, and may shed light on pathways underlying a number of pathological and anti-pathogenic (viral, bacterial, parasitic) pathways, with putative translatable value to human pathologies, zoonotic diseases and development of therapies for infections, including anti-viral therapies. While these data fall short of directing immediate clinical intervention for human disease, they do mandate further study of deimination in future work of broader scope and pre-clinical focus. For example, deimination will need further exploration as an additional diversification mechanism of ultralong CDR3 \u201ccattlebodies\u201d that have shown remarkable reach for broad viral neutralization. Also, importance for PADs in host-pathogen interactions, including in viral infections and in relation to COVID-19, may be of considerable importance and needs to be further investigated. ",

For LC-MS/MS analysis, the F95-enriched eluates were run 0.5 cm into a 12% TGX gel (BioRad, UK), the band cut out, trypsin digested and subjected to proteomic analysis on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nanoUPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA.) system and a QExactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA, USA) according to previously described methods [93,99]. In brief, peptides were separated by reverse-phase chromatography and a Thermo Scientific reverse-phase nano Easy-spray column (Thermo Scientific PepMap C18, 2 \u00b5m particle size, 100A pore size, 75 \u00b5m i.d. \u00d7 50 cm length). First, a pre-column (Thermo Scientific PepMap 100 C18, 5 \u00b5m particle size, 100A pore size, 300 \u00b5m i.d. \u00d7 5 mm length) was used for loading the peptides from the Ultimate 3000 autosampler, in the presence of 0.1% formic acid for 3 min (flow rate 10 \u00b5L/min). Therafter, peptides were eluted from the pre-column onto the analytical column (solvent A = water + 0.1% formic acid; solvent B = 80% acetonitrile, 20% water + 0.1% formic acid). A linear gradient of 2\u201340% B was applied for 30 min. An easy-Spray source (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) as used to spray the LC eluant into the mass spectrometer. The m/z values of the eluting ions were measured using an Orbitrap mass analyzer. The resolution was set at 70,000 and scanning was performed at m/z 380\u20131500. Fragment ions were automatically isolated and generated based on data dependent scans (top 20) in the HCD collision cell by higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD, NCE:25%). The resulting fragment ions were measured using the Orbitrap analyzer, set at a resolution of 17500. Ions that were singly charged, or with unassigned charge states, were excluded from selection for MS/MS. Furthermore, a dynamic exclusion window of 20 seconds was applied. The Protein Discoverer (version 2.1., Thermo Scientific) was used to process the data post-run and the MS/MS data was thereafter converted to mgf files. For identification of deiminated protein hits, the files were then submitted to the Mascot search algorithm (Matrix Science, London, UK) and searched against the UniProt Bos taurus_ 20170607 database (24148 sequences; 40594 residues) and Bos_primigenius primigenius_20191209 database (54 sequences; 14783 residues), as well as a common contaminant sequences (123 sequences; 40594 residues). Fragment and peptide mass tolerances and were set at 0.1 Da and 20 ppm, respectively. The peptide cut-off score was set at 31 and significance at p < 0.05 (carried out by Cambridge Proteomics, Cambridge, UK). ",
