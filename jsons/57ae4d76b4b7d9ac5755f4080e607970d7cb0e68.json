The population sizes of Hubei province and Wuhan city were respectively 59.33 and 11.23 million at the end of 2019. The natural growth in the numbers of persons per day during the past 10 years were respectively 770 and 125 on average in Hubei province and Wuhan city (Tables S2, S3 ). The total population sizes at the end of 2019 and natural growth in the numbers of persons per day on average during the past 10 years are used to calculate the total population sizes every day of Hubei province and Wuhan city in 2020.
