            "text": "Intuitively, one vulnerability to severe illness from COVID-19 would be assumed to be cigarette smoking [8] because it is known to increase the risk of serious respiratory infections [5\u20137]. But is this in fact true? In this issue of Internal and Emergency Medicine, Farsalinos et al. [9] explore the hypothesis that smokers are at higher risk and unexpectedly found data that point to the opposite and counter-intuitive conclusion that smoking may actually have a protective effect. Their systematic review observed that smoking is vastly protective for hospitalized COVID-19 based on the surprisingly low prevalence of smoking in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. While it is possible that the prevalence of smokers in Chinese case series may be underrepresented due to inaccurate recording of their smoking status, similar findings have been now being reported in the US, Germany and in France. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [10] report an unusually low prevalence of current smoking among COVID-19 cases at 1.3% compared to population smoking prevalence in US of 16.5% [11]. A cross-sectional analysis of 4103 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients treated at academic hospitals in New York City, demonstrated again a low smoking prevalence of 5.2% [12]. A multivariate analysis performed by the New York researchers showed a significant protective effect against hospitalization among current and former tobacco users (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.57\u20130.87 p = 0.001). Moreover, smoking was not a risk factor for critical disease or death. In Germany, a recent case series of hospitalized COVID-19 patients found a low smoking prevalence of about 6% [13]. The protective association has been also recently observed in France where smoking prevalence reported for various age groups and levels of disease severity roughly average to about 1/5 of the population prevalence [14]. These findings are consistent with the Chinese findings of Farsalinos et al. [9].",

            "text": "For the evidence about the effects of smoking on COVID-19, the accuracy of Chinese reporting could be questioned. Guan et al. [1] recently reported frequency of comorbidities in 1590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients and added an additional 489 COVID-19 Chinese patients to the original sample of 1099 patients, altering the dataset that the authors had published a few weeks earlier [15]. A careful examination of both papers points to substantial discrepancies. The most inexplicable relates to the number of patients with chronic renal disease, with a phenomenal 34-fold increase of cases from 8 (0.7% of the total sample of 1099) to 269 (16.9% of the total sample of 1590). The same discrepancy occurs with the number of COVID-19 patients with cancer increasing 13-fold from 0.9 to 8.2% and patients with immunodeficiency increasing 30-fold from 0.2 to 3.7%. Another puzzling discrepancy is that the larger study has fewer current/former smokers (n = 111) compared to numbers reported in the smaller study (n = 158). In a retrospective case\u2013control Chinese study comparing hospitalized COVID-19 patients with ARDS to hospitalized H1N1 patients with ARDS, 11% of the 73 patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 were smokers and 47% of the 75 patients with ARDS due to H1N1 were smokers [16]. This substantial difference in the number of patients who smoke suggests that Chinese clinicians do not appear to be under-reporting patients\u2019 smoking status in their medical records. Moreover, one Chinese paper that actively gathered detailed smoking data rather than relying on medical records reported that only 2 of 140 COVID-19 patients smoked and that seven were former smokers [17]. Thus, similar low smoking prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 patients was also found even when using better data collection methods for reporting smoking status. Of note, the Chinese paper which accurately reports smoking status observed the lowest smoking prevalence of all those included in the analysis by Farsalinos et al. ([9]; see Fig. 1).",
