We present an improvement which can be worn with a basic surgical mask, comprised of three interlocking rubber bands, that substantially improves the facial seal of the mask and may allow it to serve as a substitute for the N95 respirator in times of shortage. We refer to this improvement as the Double Eights Mask Brace (DEMB).",

The brace consists of a central size #64 (3.5 x 0.25 inch) rubberband, which is fitted over the bridge of the nose and under the chin, and two size #33 (3.5 x 0.125 inch) rubber bands knotted together with the central band, which serve as anchors for the brace (see Fig. 1 , model is author BF). The masks were fitted with a grommet and then subjected to OSHA standard quantitative fit testing (29 CFR 1910.134). Using the TSI PortaCount Pro Model 8038 and Model 8026 Particle Generator (Shoreview, MN), ambient saline particles were generated within the testing area and the concentration of these particles were sampled both inside and outside the mask (see Fig. 2 ). The external and internal measurements were continuously compared while the subject underwent the OSHA specified testing components: normal breathing, deep breathing, rotating the head side to side, flexing and extending the neck, talking while reading a pre-specified script, standing and bending continuously from the waist, and finally normal breathing again. The degree of mask seal present during each testing component was recorded, as was the overall fit factor of the mask. All evaluations were performed at the level of N95 respirator fit test standards, which requires an overall fit factor > 100 on a 0-200 scale. For reference, the fit factor is expressed as the challenge aerosol concentration outside the respirator divided by the challenge aerosol concentration that leaks inside the respirator during the fit test. Subjects were tested in three scenarios: with the fit aid anchored behind the ears, behind the head with a paperclip, or on the side knobs of their face shields. In addition to whether the subject passed the quantitative fit test in each scenario, data on overall fit factor and the fit factor for the seven individual components of the test were recorded. Baseline characteristics were analyzed with summary statistics, and fit testing was compared between the 3 securement locations.",

            "text": "The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 22, 2020. Filter pressure drop, or \"breathing resistance,\" measurements were conducted using a passthrough cylinder with an inner diameter of 2.7 cm. A portion of the surgical mask was tightly clamped between the upper and lower portions of the cylinder. The air flow rate through the cylinder was induced with a vacuum pump such that the velocity of air going through the mask portion was the same as if testing the entire mask at inflow rates of 15 -85 LPM. These inflow rates represent the range of minute volumes experienced by a sedentary to a highly active person. 4 Furthermore, 85 LPM is equivalent to the testing flow rate when performing the NIOSH certification test for N95s. The velocity calculation was conducted by comparing the area of the inner hole of the testing column with the measured area between the rubber bands encircling the nose and mouth of 154 cm2. Flexible tubing was used to connect a calibrated pressure transmitter (Series 646, Dwyer Instruments, Inc., Michigan City, MI) that measures in the range of 0 -65 mm H2O air pressure to pressure taps installed above and below the mask media. NIOSH stipulates that an N95 should not exceed 30 mm H2O when tested at 85 L/min and this pressure level was used as the standard for the Halyard 47567 mask used in this study. The voltage output signal of the transmitter was received by an analog-to-digital converter and read using the Labview software system (National Instruments, Austin, TX) every 0.25 s. The average of 100 such measurements established the pressure drop across the mask section.",
