Fewer than 30,000 species have been described, but the actual diversity of the phylum may be closer to 1 million species [1]. Despite estimates that at least half of all nematodes are free-living [1, 2], most research has focused on parasitic nematodes of medical and agricultural importance. Particularly neglected are the free-living marine nematodes, with only around 6900 species described [3] and no genomes published to date [4]. Of significance, free-living nematodes are generally the most abundant and diverse metazoans of marine sediments [5\u20138] where they are important as decomposers, predators, food for higher trophic levels [9], and as bioindicators for climate change and ecological disturbance [10\u201312].",

Nematode evolutionary history is particularly interesting because of the diversity of niches they occupy \u2013 ranging from the blood and tissues of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, unicellular eukaryotes, all parts of plants, virtually every terrestrial habitat, and all aquatic environments including deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities \u2013 is unrivaled in Metazoa [15\u201318]. Thus, resolving nematode phylogeny, especially the branching order close to the root of the nematode tree, will not only improve our understanding of the origin of economically important groups, but will provide a phylogenetic framework for understanding the underlying key characters (e.g., genomic modifications) corresponding to different nematode lifestyles, advancing all aspects of nematology, from basic evolutionary biology to pathogen control and drug development [19].",

Dorylaimia includes many free-living soil nematodes and plant parasites, but also vertebrate parasites such as Trichinella, whipworms, and Dioctophyme. Enoplia primarily consists of free-living aquatic nematodes, but also several lineages of soil nematodes and virus-transmitting plant pests (such as stubby root nematodes). Chromadoria includes a wide diversity of free-living aquatic nematodes but also familiar animal parasites (e.g. Ascaris, hookworms, and Dirofilaria), plant parasites (e.g. cyst and root knot nematodes), and the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans.",

These include indeterminate development [31\u201333] and retention of the nuclear envelope in mature spermatozoa (other nematodes investigated to date have determinate development and spermatozoa that lose the nuclear envelope upon maturation [34]). As other metazoan lineages are thought to have marine origins, nematodes have traditionally been assumed to have evolved in the marine environment [24, 26, 35]. Thus the primarily marine habits of Enoplia, combined with their presumed ancestral developmental features, have led to them being viewed as the earliest-branching nematode lineage [7, 30]. On the other hand, De Ley and Blaxter [22] suggested the possibility of a terrestrial origin of nematodes with the sister group to all other nematodes being the taxon least represented in the marine environment, Dorylaimia. Ribosomal DNA-based studies have been unable to resolve the branching order among these deepest branches within Nematoda. Even studies focused on improved representation of diverse marine free-living nematodes [7, 36] failed to find resolution at the base of the nematode tree, suggesting that additional molecular markers are needed to resolve deep nematode phylogeny.",

Until now, phylogenomic analyses of Nematoda have focused on parasitic taxa and model Caenorhabditis spp., with little or no representation of other free-living nematodes. For example, Blaxter and Koutsovoulos [40] and Koutsovoulos [41] curated the largest phylogenomic datasets for Nematoda to date but included only a single member of Enoplia in their studies. The latest comparative phylogenomic study focusing on parasitic worms included a handful of free-living nematodes (mostly model organisms), but no representatives of Enoplia or early branching Chromadoria [42]. Likewise, phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial genomes have never included representatives of Enoplia [43\u201346] because the mitochondrial genome has not yet been sequenced for any member of this clade.",

Enoplia received moderate support (bs = 88), while monophyly of Enoplida could not be established.

PhyloTreePruner examines single-gene trees and, if there are two or more sequences from a taxon that do not form a clade, the tree is pruned to the largest subclade in which all taxa are represented by just one sequence. Only the subset of sequences corresponding to that subtree is retained for concatenation and species tree reconstruction. Unfortunately, the PhyloTreePruner algorithm can result in the unnecessary exclusion of large numbers of sequences when even a single taxon has two or more sequences that do not form a clade in single-gene trees (Th\u00e1len and Kocot, unpublished data). Aside from paralogy, putative single-gene trees with two or more sequences from the same taxon that do not form a clade may also be caused by the presence of very short and/or mis-aligned contigs, low-quality contigs, or incorrect single gene trees. This problem is exacerbated as the number of sampled taxa increases (Th\u00e1len and Kocot, unpublished data).",

Because the HaMStR \u201cmodel organisms\u201d core ortholog set used in this study is known to consist of genes that are single copy across diverse metazoan phyla [48], paralogy is unlikely to be problematic with this dataset (although taxon-specific gene duplications are possible). Thus, we re-ran our pipeline using SCaFoS [50] to select sequences for concatenation. SCaFoS excludes highly divergent sequences (i.e., it is still able to exclude, non-nematode contamination) and selects the best sequence for each taxon based on average p-distance. As noted above, this resulted in a larger and much more complete dataset (64.99% matrix occupancy).",

Our SCaFoS-based phylogeny supports the \u201ctraditional\u201d view of early nematode evolution with Enoplia sister to the rest of Nematoda, a topology used as a basis for the long-standing yet poorly explored hypothesis that the phylum arose in the marine environment [22, 24, 26, 35]. The alternative hypothesis of the primarily terrestrial Dorylaimia as the sister to the rest of Nematoda [22], receives no support from either of our analyses.",

Our results place a clade containing Dorylaimida, Mermithida and Mononchida sister to a clade with Dioctophymatida and Trichinellida. Our recovery of Mermithida as the sister taxon of Mononchida is in agreement with 18S rDNA based phylogenetic studies (e.g. [27], but in discordance with morphology-based theories, which suggest closer affinities between Mermithida and Dorylaimida [55, 56] or Mermithida and Trichinellida (=Trichocephalida) [57]. Another exception is in the branching pattern of Rhabditida: our analysis places Spirurina as a sister to Tylenchina + Rhabditina (in full agreement with all 18S rDNA-based and most phylogenomic studies), while [42] recovered Tylenchina as a sister to Rhabditina + Spirurina, albeit with relatively low bootstrap support.",

Relationships among ecdysozoan phyla have varied somewhat dramatically among studies (reviewed by [72]), prompting numerous conflicting phylogenetic hypotheses. Our results find no support for some traditionally hypothesized groups including Nematoida (Nematoda + Nematomorpha), Panarthropoda (Arthropoda, Onychophora, and Tardigrada), or Cycloneuralia (Scalidophora + Nematoida). Interestingly, we recover Tardigrada as the sister taxon of Nematoda. A close relationship of Tardigrada to Nematoda has been recovered in other recent phylogenomic studies [73\u201377], but data from representatives of Nematomorpha have been limited. Interestingly, the PhyloTreePruner-based analysis recovers the traditionally hypothesized placement of Onychophora as the sister taxon of Arthropoda with strong support (bs = 98) but in the SCaFoS-based analysis, it is recovered as the sister taxon of a clade of all other non-scalidophoran ecdysozoans with maximal support. The limited taxon sampling for key ecdysozoan clades (e.g., just one onychohoran, one nematomorph, no heterotardigrades, no loriciferans, etc.) further demonstrates the need for high-quality genomic and transcriptomic resources from this part of the animal tree.",

One of the complications, however, is that animal parasitic nematodes evolved independently at least 18 times [90], if not more [40, 86], and one cannot expect the same underlying mechanism to be behind these numerous independent events. Moreover, the majority of animal parasitic clades have no identified, closely related free-living taxon suitable for comparative analysis [19]. These include all parasites from the subclass Dorylaimia and the most diverse and economically important Spirurina. Even the closest relative of such a well-researched taxon as the entomopathogenic genus Steinernema remains unclear [58, 91]. Thus, further expanding sampling of free-living nematodes in phylogenomic studies will be an integral part of any future research aiming to understand the evolution of parasitism \u2013 it will help elucidate sister-group relationships of those parasitic taxa for which the closest free-living relatives are yet unidentified and provide much needed comparative data for identification of parasitism-related genetic modifications.",

Of the Rhabditida species included in our analyses, 50 are parasites of animals, 12 are plant parasitic, and the remaining 18 are thought to be free-living inhabitants of soil or saprophytic communities (although some are phoretically associated with invertebrates). The next largest set of species, 11 in number, represent exclusively the parasitic order Trichinellida (with about 400 known species). The remainder of the phylum, consisting of 17 orders and including free-living (in particular almost all known marine species), plant- and animal parasitic nematodes (with about 9200 species in total), is unevenly represented in our analysis: nine orders are represented by 17 species, while eight orders are not included at all. Out of 108 species included in this phylogenetic analysis, 63 are animal parasitic and 14 are associated with plants, while only 31 are free-living, of which 22 are fresh water and soil inhabitants and only nine are marine.

Those researchers who are interested solely in the origin and early evolution of animal parasitism can find interesting models among free-living Enoplida [93], Chromadorida [94], Monhysterida [95, 96] and Plectida [97\u201399] \u2013 species with parasitic lifestyles but with morphology retaining many features of their close, free-living relatives. Phylogenetic analysis and subsequent ancestral character state reconstruction would elucidate features of free-living ancestors of parasites and generate new hypotheses regarding the evolution of parasitism. Secondly, studies aimed at improving general nematode phylogeny and classification must focus on the species described above in the \u201cMinor\u201d problems in nematode phylogeny and taxa to which they were once believed to be related to. Finally, large taxonomic categories currently represented by single or few genomes/transcriptomes (Triplonchida, Mononchida, Dorylaimida, etc) also deserve attention, and further sampling of those taxa would elucidate relationships in those clades and likely spur research into yet more unanswered questions.",

We have also, however, revealed how poorly sampled the current dataset is relative to the tremendous diversity of nematodes on Earth. Sequencing and re-sequencing of more species and broad scale comparative studies can also reveal and correct misidentified or mislabelled datasets (the case of Heterorhabditis indica). Transcriptome sequencing of nematodes is still strongly biased toward parasitic and \u201cmodel\u201d taxa, particularly those in the Rhabditida, neglecting the free-living clades that hold the key to the origins of the phylum. Our understanding of nematode early evolution and various pathways towards parasitism will be improved only by broader sampling and sequencing of free-living taxa.",

Sequences matching a pHMM were compared to the proteome of Caenorhabditis elegans using BLASTP with the default search settings of HaMStR. If the Caenorhabditis elegans amino acid sequence contributing to the pHMM was the best BLASTP hit in each of these back-BLASTs, the sequence was then assigned to that putative orthology group (simply referred to as \u201cgene\u201d henceforth). Redundant sequences that were identical (including partial sequences that were identical at least where they overlapped) were then removed with UniqHaplo (http://raven.wrrb.uaf.edu/~ntakebay/teaching/programming/perl-scripts/uniqHaplo.pl), leaving only unique sequences for each taxon. Each gene was then aligned with MAFFT 7.215 using the automatic alignment strategy with a \u201cmaxiterate\u201d value of 1000 [108]. Alignments were then trimmed with BMGE (\u2212g 0.5) to remove ambiguously aligned regions and any alignments shorter than 50 bp were deleted. Sequences that did not overlap with all other sequences in the alignment by at least 20 amino acids were deleted, starting with the shortest sequences not meeting this criterion.

Number AY274389) having the highest identity score. Similar results were obtained by mining the transcriptome assembly downloaded directly from GenBank.",

This section was added to a selection of 18S rDNA sequences downloaded from SILVA database [116] and representing all major clades of Rhabditida, including all available near-full length sequences for identified species from the genera Heterorhabditis, Heterodera and Globodera. The alignment was created using MUSCLE at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/ under default settings and trimmed to a size of a fragment from the Heterorhabditis indica transcriptome.
