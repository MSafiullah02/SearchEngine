            "text": "Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have been recognized as important causes of hospitalization in elderly adults during the winter months. However, the role of other respiratory viruses has been less well defined. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses cause the majority of common cold syndromes [1, 2] . With the exception of severely immunocompromised hosts, these viruses are uncommonly associated with severe illnesses resulting in hospitalizations [3, 4] . This phenomenon may be due to the limited virulence of these pathogens and the pathogenesis of their infections, but it may also be due to the lack of detection, either because of the failure to perform appropriate tests or the difficulty in identifying these organisms using standard viral culture and serologic techniques. Several reports describe the effects of coronavirus and rhinovirus infection in elderly persons in day care or long-term care [5, 6] . Although lower respiratory signs and symptoms were common, serious sequelae were not often observed. Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses also have been implicated in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [7, 8] . However, most studies used viral culture or serologic testing to diagnose infections and did not comment on hospitalization rates. A recent large study of patients of all ages hospitalized with respiratory illnesses demonstrated that rhinoviruses and coronaviruses accounted for 5.1% of illnesses [9] . Because culture and serologic testing, rather than new molecular techniques, were used for diagnosis, the authors postulated that the incidence of disease may have been significantly underestimated. Reverse-transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a very sensitive and specific method of diagnosis that has been used with success to accurately define the true burden of disease due to these common viruses [10, 11] . The purpose of this study was to determine whether rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, as diagnosed by RT-PCR and serologic testing, are associated with hospitalization in elderly adults during the winter months and to describe the presenting signs and symptoms of these illnesses.",

The eluted RNA was transcribed into cDNA with murine reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT; Gibco BRL) and virus specific oligonucleotide primer, for 1 h at 37 C. After MMLV-RT denaturation at 95 C, virus-specific 5 0 biotinylated oligonucleotide primer and Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems) were added, and 35 cycles of PCR were run, consisting of denaturation (1 min at 95 C for HRV; 2 min at 95 C for HCV), annealing (1.5 min at 48.2 C for HRV; 1 min at 60 C for HCV), and DNA extension for 1 min at 72 C. The pairs of primers for coronaviruses OC43 and 229E were used in the same reaction in a multiplex format. Excess primers, dNTPs, Taq DNA polymerase, and salts were removed by adsorbing the amplified product to the QIAquick silica-gel membrane (QIAquick PCR purification kit; Qiagen). The presence of the PCR product was detected by microplate hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled virusspecific probes, as described elsewhere [13] .

All patients had significant underlying chronic medical conditions, primarily CHF and COPD, and 1 patient had chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Consistent with the high rate of lung disease, 92% were active or previous smokers, 33% took corticosteroids daily, and 50% received oxygen at home. Seventy-five percent had exposure to young children. Compared with patients infected with influenza during the same period, the rhinovirus/coronavirus group had significantly more lung disease. Nasal congestion and cough were common symptoms (67% and 78%, respectively), as were lower respiratory tract symptoms of dyspnea (83%) and sputum production (58%). Constitutional symptoms, such as fatigue and myalgias, occurred in only 33% of patients with HRV or HCV, compared with 54% in influenza virus-infected patients. Fever was significantly less common in the HRV and HCV group than in the influenza group (mean temperature, 37:4 C^1:0 C vs. 38:4 C^1:1 C; P \u00bc :005). Patients were quite ill at admission, with 75% demonstrating wheezing and rales by auscultation. Supplemental oxygen was required for all but 1 individual. Most patients received steroids (75%), bronchodilators (83%), and antibiotics (83%). All patients eventually recovered and were discharged after a mean length of stay of 8 days. There were no distinct features of rhinovirus or coronavirus infection. Four patients had radiographically proven pneumonia (2 with coronavirus and 2 with rhinovirus infection). One 89-year-old woman with rhinovirus infection had a history of COPD and presented with a temperature of 39.3 C, an SaO 2 level of 57%, and an infiltrate on chest X-ray. No blood or sputum cultures were obtained. The other rhinovirus-positive patient with pneumonia had CLL, a temperature of 39.0 C, and blood and sputum cultures that grew no pathogens. Both patients with coronavirus infection and pneumonia were elderly women with CHF and presented with nasal congestion, cough, and dyspnea and had visible rhinorrhea at examination. Blood cultures were sterile, and 1 patient tested positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in an inadequate sputum sample.

One patient required intensive care, but all survived. Of interest, 2 patients with rhinovirus infections had high fevers and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Rhinoviruses are rarely implicated as a cause of pneumonia, which is believed to reflect their biologic characteristics [14] . However, recent data from Papadopoulos et al. [15] suggest that infection of the lower airways is possible and that rhinoviruses may have direct effects on the lower respiratory tract epithelium. The high frequency of lower respiratory tract symptoms in ambulatory elderly persons with rhinovirus infections and the recovery of rhinovirus from expectorated sputum samples are additional evidence for viral invasion of the lower airways [5, 11] . It is unknown how often bacterial suprainfection in the lower respiratory tract follows HRV or HCV infection. Despite these uncertainties, mixed viralbacterial infection in our patients seems likely, although one person had CLL, thus making a viral pneumonia a possibility.",

It does not appear that healthy elderly persons are at high risk from these agents. These viruses, although not as common as influenza and RSV among hospitalized adults, also circulate during the winter months, producing similar clinical syndromes. The use of RT-PCR improves the ability to identify these previously difficult to detect viruses, but further studies with control groups are needed to fully define the impact of HCV and HRV in hospitalized elderly adults.",
