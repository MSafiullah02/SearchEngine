While detection of CMV by PCR in blood in the context of clinical signs/ symptoms consistent with CMV disease is suggestive, more certain diagnosis typically requires diagnostic bronchoscopy and/or tissue biopsy. Furthermore, CMV PCR detection in blood is not fully sensitive for the detection of end-organ disease, particularly gastrointestinal disease. If CMV disease is suspected, tissue biopsy (for histopathology and viral culture) should be obtained when feasible. c. When CMV end-organ disease is suspected/proven, consultation with the infectious diseases service for patient-specific treatment recommendations is advised. First-line therapy for CMV disease is generally IV ganciclovir, with foscarnet reserved for cases with intolerance to ganciclovir (e.g., refractory cytopenias) or if ganciclovir resistance is suspected (e.g., if CMV viral load increases while on therapy for more than 2 weeks) or documented. d. Ganciclovir-resistant virus is an unusual occurrence in the HSCT population and most often occurs in patients who have had prolonged exposure to ganciclovir or valganciclovir. e.

While data on optimal dosing of cidofovir are not available, the usual practice is to use 5 mg/kg IV once weekly (renal dose adjustment as indicated) for 2 weeks and then every other week in the setting of life-threatening or disseminated disease, along with probenecid 2 g po 3 h prior to cidofovir dose, then 1 g po at 2 and 8 h after dose. Important adverse drug effects associated with cidofovir administration include nephrotoxicity as well as hematologic and ocular toxicity, and so careful monitoring is recommended in this setting. ii. When possible, immune suppression should be reduced in the setting of life-threatening or disseminated adenovirus disease. a. EBV can result in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), manifesting as fever, adenopathy, and/or extranodal disease. b. Quantitative EBV PCR from blood and/or other body fluids (e.g., CSF) may support the diagnosis, though certain diagnosis requires tissue biopsy with immunohistochemistry. c. EBV viral load monitoring has been recommended by some for certain highrisk HSCT recipients, though the threshold for preemptive intervention is not clear.

First-line therapy for established CD20-positive PTLD is the administration of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab). Infusion of EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes has been used with success in various study protocols, though this requires significant time for in vitro generation. There is little evidence at this time to support the contribution of antiviral therapy for this indication.",

Common diagnostic modalities include culture (from blood and/or other body fluids/tissue) and antigen-based testing (serum or CSF cryptococcal antigen). Diagnostic workup should include lumbar puncture when this entity is considered. iii. Management is with liposomal amphotericin or fluconazole, along with serial lumbar punctures for management of elevated intracranial pressure in the context of cryptococcal meningitis. iv. Although a mainstay of combination therapy with an amphotericin B formulation for HIV-positive patients with cryptococcal meningitis, concurrent use of flucytosine is often poorly tolerated in HSCT recipients given the potential for marrow suppression. v. Consultation with the infectious diseases service is recommended.",

If fevers persist, blood cultures should be obtained in the context of clinical worsening and/or prior to any change to the empiric antibiotic regimen. iv. After initial defervescence with empiric antibiotics, recrudescent fever should be reevaluated with blood cultures and careful clinical assessment.d. Adjustment of empiric antibiotic regimen:i. If cultures are positive or if source of infection is defined, ensure regimen is appropriate based on pathogen susceptibility pattern and/or source. ii. Discontinue empiric antibiotic therapy once absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 500 cells/mm 3 if patient remains afebrile and provided there is no documented infection.2. Indications for use of empiric extended Gram-positive coverage for neutropenic fever:a. Add vancomycin for any patient with:i. Sepsis/unstable clinical condition, particularly for those patients with an established history of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) colonization or infection, and not previously known to be colonized/infected with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) ii. Documented infection with a Gram-positive organism while awaiting results of identification and susceptibility testing (e.g., Gram-positive cocci in clusters or pairs/chains for patient not previously known to be VRE colonized/infected) iii. Skin/soft tissue infection iv. Suspected/established catheter-related infection v. Healthcare-associated pneumonia, while awaiting data from respiratory culture b. For patients known to be VRE colonized/infected, use daptomycin * as extended Gram-positive agent in the setting of sepsis and/or Gram-positive bacteremia (Gram-positive cocci in pairs and/or chains) while awaiting results of identification and susceptibility testing. Given the potential for myelosuppression with linezolid, daptomycin may be the preferred agent in this setting. * Note that daptomycin should not be used for the treatment of pneumonia, given its ineffectiveness in this setting; in the setting of possible/proven MRSA pneumonia, consider the use of vancomycin or linezolid. c. Blood as well as wound and sputum (when applicable) cultures should be obtained prior to adding vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid. d. Discontinue vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid after 72 h if no Grampositive organisms have been cultured and patient has no evidence of shock, pneumonia, skin/soft tissue, or central venous catheter source, regardless of the presence or absence of fever.
