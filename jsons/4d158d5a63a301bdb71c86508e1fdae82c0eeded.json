It enhances the immature immune system of the infant and strengthens defense mechanisms against infectious and other agents throughout the breastfeeding period 12 . Several studies demonstrated that continued, frequent breastfeeding is associated with greater linear growth and further protects child health by delaying maternal fertility postpartum and reducing the child's risk of morbidity and mortality 13 . 15 . A case study from Australia, described a mother with COVID-19 not separated from her infant; breast feeding appears possible and safe when viral precautions are observed 20 . Further studies are needed to confirm these results. Even if virus is transmitted occasionally, risks and benefits would have to be balanced, and the long term risks of not breastfeeding would need to enter the equation. As the data currently available show that clinical feature of COVID-19 in children and infants is generally mild and risks for viral transmission from mother to child are likely to be directly related to a COVID-19",

Current data do not support this possibility. Although vertical maternal-fetal transmission cannot be ruled out, several small studies of pregnant women infected with COVID-19 found no evidence of vertical transmission, as no infant tested positive at birth14 and it is likely that the sources of SARS-CoV-2 in the neonates' upper respiratory tracts or anuses are maternal in origin14 . Furthermore, the virus was not detected in samples of amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood or placental tissue15,16,17,18 . Few cases of newborns infected by the novel coronavirus have been reported, however it remains unclear whether they were infected before, during or after delivery and by what means14,19 .There is no evidence to date to suggest the novel coronavirus can pass to infants through breast-milk, as COVID-19 was not found in breast milk. This possibility cannot be completely ruled out, since the data available are based on limited clinical experience developed over few months during the novel COVID-19 pandemc, on studies performed in women affected by COVID-19 and data collected during previous infectious outbreaks caused by other types of coronavirus, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Clinical features of the infection and the dynamics of the COVID-19 spread among human populations and between individuals and the risks for infants, including those whose mothers carry the infection, are key elements of this accelerated learning process.
