However, the injury may be inhomogeneous and diverse at different lung lobes and different parts of the same lobe. The characteristic change in early phase is pulmonary edema, with homogeneous pink serous or fibrinous effusions filling alveolar cavities as well as erythrocytes leakages in some cavities. The effusions from some alveolar cavities may condense to form thin-layer membranelike substance which adheres to alveolar walls, namely, formation of hyaline membrane (Fig. 2.1). Alveolar epithelia present with such diffusive injuries as degeneration and necrosis, with exfoliated or/and apoptotic type II alveolar epithelial cells observable in alveolar cavities, which are similar to changes of desquamative pneumonia (Fig. 2.2). Among them, some appear like apoptotic bodies. Partial regional type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages proliferate actively, with obvious increase of cell volume and distinct nucleolus. In some case, cells are detected fusing with each other to form syncytial monocytes and multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 2.3). The alveolar epithelia of some cases are examined with structures similar to viral inclusion bodies, mostly spherical and with eosinophilic staining, around which a transparent halo is visible (Fig. 2.4). Pulmonary interstitium and alveolar spaces are detected with high dilation and congestion of capillaries, swelling and exfoliation of epithelial cells, as well as widening of the latter, which present slight lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration, small vessel proliferation, and enlargement characteristic of vasculitis changes. Some regions are observed with pulmonary vascular embolism or fibrinous microthrombi in alveolar capillaries, while some alveolar capillary cavities manifest dilation but free of blood components. In addition, some patients are detected with lung tissue focal hemorrhage, compensatory emphysema, and small airway necrotizing inflammation and alveolar collapse or shrinkage. Patients with a disease course of over three weeks manifest fibroblast proliferation in alveolar septa, and individual cases demonstrate organization of fibrinous exudates from alveoli and fibroblast proliferation, which gives rise to glomeruloid structures, named \u201cglomeruloid organizing pneumonia\u201d (Fig. 2.5). The bronchial epithelial cells are revealed with exfoliation, scarce and exfoliated cilia, as well as structures similar to viral inclusions and squamous cell metaplasia at the inside.

Thin-layer CT scan or HRCT scan can better visualize intrapulmonary low-density small lesions, thus contributory to early diagnosis of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.

On T2-weighted image, a high-signal line is visible at the medial low-signal sclerotic reaction line, thus forming the typical double-line sign. The double-line sign could reflect congestion and inflammation of granulation tissues and proves specific to aseptic necrosis of femoral head. Severe inflammation, congestion, fibrosis, and sclerosis could greatly deplete the amount of lipids of femoral head, which presents liquid-like signals on MRI, low signals on T1-weighted image, and high signals on T2-weighted images. Advanced cases are typical of fibrosis and sclerosis, and the affected area present with fibrotic MRI features, that is, low signals on T1- and T2-weighted and proton density-weighted imaging. Complication with effusions in hip joints appears as T1 low signals and T2 high signals.",

In light of the aforementioned MR staging criteria, SARS cases complicated by aseptic necrosis of femoral head already reported are mostly in phase II.",

Therefore, if necessary, MR examinations of other joints shall be conducted to ascertain the extent and degree of lesions. If SARS patients complain of pain at both hip joints and limited movement, CT scan or MRI examination of both hip joints is recommended to conclude definite diagnosis. X-ray plain scan is not sensitive to early bone ischemic necrosis, which therefore is not preferred (Fig. 2.17 and 2.18).\n\n",
