Available data would suggest the proportion of patients admitted to ICU with ESRD ranges between 1 and 9 %. The reported variability in ESRD admissions across studies is likely accounted for by differences in practice patterns, availability of ICU resources, patient case-mix, and study design. ESRD patients have consistently been shown to have an estimated 25-30fold higher annual likelihood of admission to ICU when compared with the non-ESRD general population. ESRD patients admitted to ICU have several notable differences in baseline characteristics when compared with non-ESRD patients. ESRD patients are generally younger, have more comorbid disease, more likely medical (i.e., nonoperative admissions), and have higher illness severity scores compared with non-ESRD patients. However, these observations may be susceptible to selection bias. Available epidemiologic surveys of ESRD patients admitted to ICU are limited by not accounting for those patients referred and refused ICU admission.",

However, ESRD patients have consistently higher shortterm mortality rates (9-44 %) when compared to non-AKI critically ill patients and an ageand sex-matched general population. Factors that have been shown to be associated with ICU mortality in ESRD patients are older age, higher illness severity score (i.e., APACHE II or SAPS II), burden of nonrenal organ dysfunction/failure, medical or nonsurgical admission type, and provision and duration of life-sustaining technologies (i.e., mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy). Studies reporting long-term survival among ESRD patients show a trend for an increased mortality rate within the first 6 months after ICU discharge, with a relatively stable but increased risk for mortality thereafter. At 2 years after ICU admission, survival is generally poor. Observational studies estimate only 1/3 of ESRD patients admitted to ICU were still alive. Although long-term mortality in ESRD patients is several times higher when compared to the general population, the presence of ESRD does not appear to independently predict long-term mortality, suggesting short-term prognosis is more related to the acute illness severity rather than CKD and dialysis dependence.",

These data coupled with the reduced HRQL for ESRD patients imply this may be a significant issue for survivors of critical illness. CKD, in particular ESRD patients, consume more health resources in association with admission to ICU compared with non-CKD patients. These patients have longer durations of ICU stay, longer duration of hospitalization, and higher rates of short-term rehospitalization.

The majority of patients have intravascular placement of arterial catheter for continuous blood pressure monitoring, due either to the presence of hemodynamic instability or to monitoring resuscitation (i.e., fluid therapy or titration of vasoactive therapy) or need for frequent blood sampling. Arterial catheters display systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure readings along with a continuous waveform. Analysis of the pressure waveform may provide useful information regarding a patient's clinical status. Variability on pulse contours is related to the elasticity, amplification, and distortion of smaller peripheral arterioles. CKD patients with significant peripheral vascular disease and/or arteriolar calcification may have reduced vessel elasticity (i.e., arterial stiffness) and exacerbated amplification that results in relative increases in systolic pressure and low diastolic pressure with rapid diastolic runoff (i.e., widened pulse pressure). ESRD patients with a fistula or graft will have accelerated diastolic runoff and as a consequence lower diastolic and mean arterial pressure. In addition, given the prevalence of comorbid conditions in CKD such as cardiac valvular disease, ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or pulmonary hypertension, arterial catheters may have misleading instantaneous accuracy, though likely have preserved trending [2] .",

These measures are confounded by alterations in ventricular wall compliance (i.e., LVH in ESRD). Both CVP and PAOP lack precision in individual patients and should not be used in isolation to guide resuscitation. This may contribute to excessive and inappropriate fluid prescription.

These patients are generally burdened with a high prevalence of comorbid disease, in particular CKD, representing up to one quarter of all mechanically ventilated patients. Kidney disease, both acute and chronic, can present unique challenges with respect to respiratory physiology, lung-kidney interaction, and mechanical ventilation support [3] . First, CKD/ ESRD patients often have high prevalence of comorbid respiratory illness such as restrictive or obstructive defects, pleural disease, pulmonary calcification, sleep apnea, or dialysis-associated hypoxemia. Patients receiving PD have chronically elevated intra-abdominal pressure and diminished functional residual capacity. These factors predispose to limited pulmonary reserve. Second, CKD/ESRD patients often have diminished cardiac reserve and all have compromised capacity to excrete solute and water. Acute cardiac events and/or fluid accumulation (i.e., noncompliance with diet, inappropriate dry weight prescription, missed dialysis) can predispose to acute cardiorenal syndrome and pulmonary edema. Third, the development of acute injury to the kidney can induce a systemic inflammatory response with distant pathophysiologic effects in the lung (i.e., alterations in alveolar permeability and aquaporin expression). Fourth, the positive pressure applied during mechanical ventilation acts to increase intrathoracic, intrapleural, and intra-abdominal pressures both during inspiration and for the duration of the respiratory cycle (i.e., PEEP) with the aim to improve and maintain adequate gas exchange. This can stimulate an array of hemodynamic, neural, and hormonal responses that can negatively impact kidney perfusion and further inhibit excretory function. This is observed as immediate and reversible declines in urine output and fluid retention, contributing to worsening fluid accumulation. Finally, mechanical ventilation may provoke ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) leading to an exacerbating cascade of systemic inflammation that may have distant injurious effects on the kidney [3] . Data have also shown the development of AKI may delay weaning from mechanical ventilation [4] . This is likely multifactorial and related to greater difficulties with volume and acid-base homeostasis in AKI. By extension, CKD/ESRD patients are similarly likely to encounter prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation.",

Of the numerous strategies evaluated to date for prevention of AKI, only fluid therapy has been shown to be consistently effective. Importantly, however, there is no evidence that fluid therapy will reverse AKI once established. Reduced urine output is common and often precedes overt AKI; however, it lacks specificity. Oliguria in the absence of clear hypovolemia or fluid responsiveness is not necessarily an indication for a fluid challenge. The distinction is important. In the context of hypovolemia and/or reduced arterial filling, fluid therapy would appear appropriate. However, there is no evidence to support a fluid challenge in the resuscitated patient with oliguric AKI. While such a fluid challenge may be intended to promote diuresis, dilute tubular toxins, and attenuate tubular obstruction from casts, there is no data to suggest it attenuates the severity of AKI or improves clinical outcome. Instead, the liberal use of fluid therapy in these circumstances may exacerbate fluid overload and lead to harm. Fluid accumulation can also mask the presence and severity of AKI by increasing the total body water and hemodiluting creatinine. Recent evidence suggests that classifying AKI after correcting creatinine concentration for the volume of fluid administered improves the ability to classify AKI and predict mortality. Unnecessary fluid accumulation and overload are associated with clear increases in morbidity, including worsening AKI and delayed renal recovery, and mortality, in particular in patients with compromised kidney function across a range of clinical settings [5] . Diuretic therapy should be reserved for mitigating fluid overload in responsive patients rather than for preventing AKI or promoting recovery of kidney function. In patients whose fluid balance cannot be managed adequately with conservative fluid administration or diuretic therapy, RRT should be considered. In addition, the routine practice of providing \"maintenance\" of unmeasured fluid deficits such as \"third space losses\" for the majority of critically ill patients is questionable, in particular for those with CKD/ ESRD, and often contributes unnecessary fluid accumulation.",

Early nutritional support in critical illness will not be significantly modified by the presence of CKD; however, in patients with advanced CKD or ESRD not supported with RRT, specialized enteric formulas are available that are more caloric dense (2 kcal/mL), low in electrolytes (i.e., K + , PO 4 \u2212 , Mg + ), and fluid restricted.

There is general consensus that RRT should be urgently initiated in the presence of life-threatening complications related to AKI such as severe electrolyte abnormalities (i.e., hyperkalemia), acid-base disturbances (i.e., academia), and fluid balance (i.e., pulmonary edema); however, outside of these indications, the optimal time to start is uncertain [11] (Table 32.8). It is likely more important to evaluate the broad clinical context of critically ill patients' admission diagnosis, illness severity, non-kidney organ dysfunction, the probability of worsening AKI or non-recovery, and additional conditions that may be modified by RRT (i.e., fluid accumulation) rather than reliance on absolute thresholds in conventional biochemical markers such as creatinine or urea. Early initiation of RRT in patients with AKI or advanced CKD has the intuitive appeal of avoiding lifethreatening AKI complications while ensuring the adequate delivery of essential medications (i.e., antimicrobials) and nutrition and transfusion support without concern for excessive fluid accumulation. Recent systematic reviews have supported this concept, suggesting earlier RRT initiation may improve survival; however, studies included in these analyses were highly susceptible to bias [17, 18] . The choice of ideal RRT modality for critically ill patients has long been debated. Systematic reviews have not shown a clear survival advantage Monitor daily fluid intake/output and daily/cumulative fluid balance, recognizing there is some \"ebb and flow\" to fluid balance in critical illness Monitor for/avoid complications of overt kidney failure Monitor AKI and CKD patients for serious complications such as hyperkalemia, acidemia, fluid overload, and drug toxicities and appropriately plan for RRT Maintain glycemic control Glycemic control has been associated with reduced incidence of AKI and lower utilization of RRT. The balance of evidence now recommends maintaining glycemic control with a target blood glucose (BG) of 6.1-10.0 mmol/L (110-180 mg/dL) rather than using intensive insulin therapy (IIT) to maintain tight glycemic control, with BG of 4.4-6.0 mmol/L (80-110 mg/dL), due to the increased risk of hypoglycemia a There should be early use of invasive/functional hemodynamic monitoring (i.e., arterial catheter, central venous pressure, echocardiography, pulmonary artery catheter, or methods to measure stroke volume or pulse pressure variation) for one modality, continuous RRT (CRRT), slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED), or intermittent RRT (IRRT), over another in critically ill patients with AKI [19] (Table 32. 9) . Ideally, the modality chosen should suit the patient's acute physiology and therapeutic objectives while avoiding treatment-related complications. CRRT is the preferred modality in hemodynamically unstable patients and those with acute brain injury or fulminant hepatic failure and at risk for intracranial hypertension and cerebral edema [11] . CRRT has also been shown superior for maintaining fluid homeostasis and mitigating fluid overload. A recent systematic review suggested that initial therapy with CRRT in critically ill patients is associated with lower rates of dialysis dependence among survivors when compared with IRRT [20] . These data may imply CRRT may be the preferred initial modality for surviving critically ill patients at increased risk for incident or worsening CKD (i.e., those with baseline CKD).",

These factors may have contributed to the observation of higher mortality for critically ill patients treated with ACEi and ARB lead to reduction in glomerular blood flow, which has beneficial effects for kidney survival in chronic kidney disease patients but may lead to worsening kidney function in patients with AKI peritoneal dialysis compared with those treated with hemodialysis. Determination of the optimal dose intensity for small solute clearance for critically ill patients with AKI has long been a clinical priority. Early randomized trials clearly favored a more intensive strategy; however, recent high-quality data have not shown a benefit with this approach. Two multicenter randomized trials, the Department of Veterans Affairs/National Institutes of Health (VA/NIH) Acute Renal Failure Trial Network (ATN) Study and the Randomized Evaluation of Normal versus Augmented Level (RENAL) Replacement Therapy Study, found no incremental benefit in critically ill patients with AKI from a more intensive (high-dose) RRT compared with a less intensive RRT strategy [22, 23] . The more intensive strategy did not decrease mortality, accelerate recovery of kidney function, or alter the rate of nonrenal organ failure. Importantly, these findings do not imply that the dose of RRT is not important, but rather, the evidence would These indications in critical illness may occur separately from patients with either life-threatening complications of AKI or advanced AKI and rather can be viewed as a platform for organ support to prevent complications and facilitate treatment Volume homeostasis Fluid accumulation is worse in AKI and is associated with worse outcome. RRT may represent part of a strategy to mitigate excessive fluid accumulation Nutritional support RRT can better enable the delivery of full nutritional support (i.e., enteral or parenteral) without the concern for excessive fluid accumulation Acid-base/electrolyte homeostasis RRT may represent part of a strategy to enable \"permissive hypercapnia\" in ICU patients with severe ARDS and AKI/CKD or mitigate adverse effects from anticipated electrolyte disorders (i.e., tumor lysis syndrome) Immunomodulation RRT may represent a strategy for modulating and restoring immune function in sepsis and associated severe inflammatory states. Studies are ongoing Drug delivery RRT can better enable the delivery of essential drugs (i.e., antimicrobials) without the concern for excessive fluid accumulation In general, RRT should be discontinued when it is no longer indicated due to either sufficient residual or recovering kidney function or a change in the overall goals of care of the patient. The best predictor for successful weaning from RRT for critically ill patients is the volume of spontaneous urine production in 24 h. Those capable of producing \u2265450-500 mL urine per day have a higher likelihood of short-term recovery and dialysis independence. There is no evidence to suggest improved or accelerated recovery and dialysis independence with early forced diuresis with furosemide.",

            "text": "In general, there are several pragmatic steps to help guide drug dosing in critically ill patients with AKI and those receiving RRT [24] . First, the literature should be reviewed for existing data on drug dose guidance for a specific drug [25] . Second, for drugs with primary renal elimination, a bedside estimate of baseline GFR and a dynamic assessment of total creatinine clearance, if applicable, should be undertaken, assuming there is no significant secretion or reabsorption. In particular, consideration should be given to patients receiving RRT who have recovering or residual renal function. Third, particularly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index and risk of toxicity, therapeutic drug monitoring when possible should be undertaken (i.e., phenytoin, vancomycin, aminoglycosides). Fourth, several drug classes may be administered based on their observed clinical response, such as with sedatives, analgesics, or vasoactive medications. However, selected drugs have potentially toxic metabolites that can accumulate in patients with reduced kidney function. As examples, the elimination of \u03b11-hydroxymidazolam (main metabolite of midazolam) and glucuronide metabolites of morphine are principally eliminated by the kidneys and thus may accumulate in AKI/CKD. Finally, given the complexity, there is a recognized need for a dedicated ICU pharmacist among the interdisciplinary ICU team, particularly for patients with CKD or AKI.",

RRT is effective for temporarily reducing serum potassium Acidemia Evidence of refractory academia and inability to adequately compensate (pH <7.15). RRT can rapidly mitigate metabolic acidosis; however, correction requires targeted treatment of the precipitating disease Pulmonary edema Evidence of fluid overload contributing to worsening hypoxemia, contributing to need for ventilatory support or prevention of weaning from ventilatory support. RRT can effectively reduce extravascular lung water in diuretic-resistant states Uremic complications Pericarditis, bleeding, encephalopathy. In modern ICU practice, withholding RRT until uremic complications arise would be uncommon Nonemergent indications Azotemic control Conventional criteria evaluate blood accumulation of urea and creatinine; however, numerous additional metabolites/uremic toxins can also accumulate. Blood concentrations of these metabolites may be confounded by added factors such as nutritional status, catabolism, and volume status Fluid overload/accumulation Fluid overload/accumulation that is refractory to diuretics or when there are diuretic-induced electrolyte abnormalities can both be an important determinants for starting RRT Acid-base/electrolyte abnormalities Additional factors such as metabolic acidosis and marked electrolyte abnormalities (sodium, magnesium) can be potentially treated with RRT; however, no standardized criteria exist Renal support",
