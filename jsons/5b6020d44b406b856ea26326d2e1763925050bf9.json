In response, many countries have implemented large scale public health and social measures in an attempt to reduce transmission and minimize the impact of the outbreak. As the benefits of these measures are now becoming apparent in terms of a reduction in the daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated deaths, countries are looking for ways to lift these measures and resume economic and social activities. Ideally, the lifting of measures would occur if the population had built sufficient collective immunity, known as herd immunity, to the point that any reintroduction of the virus would not trigger a new epidemic wave. In this context, it is important to understand the extent to which infection has spread in communities, and to which those who have been infected may be protected from re-infection. This requires further understanding of antibody kinetics following SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

However, it remains unclear whether time to seroconversion may differ according to disease severity, and early reports suggest that individuals with mild infection may have delayed or absent seroconversion [4] .

Two parameters can be calculated with this assay: the first is the percentage of cells having captured antibodies, defining the seropositivity. The second is the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of this binding, which provides a quantitative measurement of the amount of antibodies and their efficacy [8] . As a control for the S-Flow tests, we included samples from pre-epidemics individuals, providing cut-offs for the the S-Flow >99% specificity ( [8] and Fig. 1A ). The rapid immunodiagnostic assay has a specificity estimated at 99.4% for the IgM, 100% for the IgG, and 99.4% for the combined IgM/IgG results (S.F.K., personal communication). Samples were also tested for neutralization activity using a viral pseudotypebased assay [8] . Briefly, single cycle lentiviral pseudotypes coated with the S protein and encoding for a luciferase reporter gene were preincubated with the serum to be tested at a dilution of 1:100, and added to 293T-ACE2 target cells.

Since these individuals are currently understood to represent at least 80% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections [9] , it is crucial to assess antibody responses in those with mild disease. In our study, we were able to show that all but At the community level, countries that have implemented public health and social measures to limit transmission are now lifting some of these measures. Most of the evidence to date suggests that herd immunity after the first wave of the epidemic will be far from sufficient to provide protection against a second epidemic wave [10] . In our study, neutralizing ID50 \u2265100 were found in 91% of the individuals. We further report that the neutralization activity of the serum increases with time, reaching 97% four weeks after the onset of symptoms. Therefore, it is a fair assumption that the majority of individuals with mild COVID-19 generate neutralizing antibodies within a month after onset of symptoms.",

In a study of 175 convalescent patients with mild symptoms, NAbs were most often detected 10-15 days after symptom onset [14] . However, about 30% of recovered patients generated low titers of NAbs (\u22641:500), even at a later time point [14] . Our results are in line with this observation and indicate that recovery from mild cases is generally, but not always, associated with high titers of NAbs in the serum. Indeed, we report here that one month after the onset of symptoms, 98% and 77% of individuals display Nabs with an ID50 and ID80 \u2265100, repectively. Antibody titers are generally higher in patients with severe or critical diseases [6, 14] . Interestingly, in our study, individuals with factors associated with more severe disease (e.g., male sex, high body mass index and high blood pressure), were more likely to have high titers of neutralizing antibodies compared to others. This may be due to a higher antigenic burden in such individuals, which will generate a stronger humoral response, or may, on the contrary, suggest that some antibodies may play a deleterious role during infection [15] . Future studies are warranted to characterize the beneficial or detrimental role of specific antibodies in COVID-19 patients and the minimal titer required for protection.",
