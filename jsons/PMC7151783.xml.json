            "text": "Infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) is an uncommonly recognized disease of dogs that is caused by canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1), a non-enveloped, icosahedral double-stranded DNA virus that is antigenically related to CAV-2 (see Chapter 17) (Figure 18-1\n). CAV-1 also causes disease in wolves, coyotes, skunks, and bears, as well as encephalitis in foxes, but the diversity of wildlife hosts is not as great as that for CDV. Ferrets are not susceptible.3 ICH has also been referred to as Rubarth\u2019s disease, after Carl Sven Rubarth, a veterinarian who first described the disease in the late 1940s.1 Over the subsequent 10 years, ICH was described worldwide, including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Brazil, and throughout Europe. The virus can survive for months at room temperature, but should be readily inactivated by disinfectants with activity against canine parvovirus (CPV).4 Disease most commonly occurs in dogs that are less than 1 year of age, but was reported in adult dogs before widespread vaccination for ICH was introduced.",

            "text": "The strong antigenic relationship between CAV-1 and CAV-2 is clinically important, because vaccines that contain CAV-2 protect against infection with CAV-1 and vice versa. After the introduction of CAV-1 vaccines, ICH largely disappeared, but over the past decade it has reemerged, with published reports of disease from Italy, Switzerland, and the United States.5., 6., 7., 8. Disease in Europe has been associated with puppy trading from kennels in eastern European countries and possibly spillover of virus circulating in wildlife.9 In Italy, three outbreaks occurred in shelters in southern Italy, and the others involved purebred puppies imported from Hungary a few days before the onset of clinical signs. Several of the dogs were co-infected with other viruses, such as canine distemper virus (CDV), CPV, or canine enteric coronavirus. Encephalopathy due to CAV-1 infection was described in nine 5-week-old Labrador retriever puppies from Arkansas in the United States, all of which belonged to the same litter.8 The litter was from an unvaccinated bitch. These case descriptions confirm that CAV-1 continues to circulate in the dog population and can result in severe disease in young dogs when vaccination does not occur, is improperly timed, and stress, co-infections, and overcrowded conditions prevail.",

Ectoparasites such as fleas and ticks are also potential mechanical vectors.4 Airborne transmission does not appear to be important. Initial infection occurs through the nasopharyngeal, conjunctival, or oropharyngeal route, and the virus replicates within the tonsils, after which it spreads to regional lymph nodes and the bloodstream via lymphatics. Subsequently, infection of hepatocytes and endothelial cells within a variety of tissues occurs, such as the lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, and eye with resultant hemorrhage, necrosis, and inflammation. The virus replicates in the nucleus of host cells, where crystalline arrays of virions form. There is severe condensation and margination of nuclear chromatin, with inclusion body formation (Figure 18-2\n). The virions are released by cell lysis, which leads to tissue injury and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Within the liver, the virus initially infects Kupffer\u2019s cells and subsequently spreads to hepatocytes.",

Viral persistence within the renal glomeruli, uveal structures of the eye (the iris and ciliary body), and the cornea can trigger immune complex formation in dogs that recover from acute illness. This leads to glomerulonephritis with proteinuria, severe uveitis, and persistent corneal edema in some surviving dogs. Glomerulonephritis usually occurs about 1 to 2 weeks after the acute signs resolve. Glomerular lesions contain deposits of viral antigen, IgG, IgM, and C3.11., 12. Infection of the glomerular endothelium is followed by a persistent tubular infection, development of interstitial nephritis, and viruria, but chronic renal failure has not been described. Viral shedding in the urine can occur for up to 6 to 9 months after infection. Anterior uveitis is associated with massive influx of inflammatory cells into the anterior chamber. Occasionally persistent corneal edema fails to resolve for months and may be associated with complications such as glaucoma.13 The Afghan hound is reportedly susceptible to this complication.14\n",

The use of parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs should be considered for dogs with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis that may develop bacteremia as a result of bacterial translocation.

Immunity after immunization with attenuated live vaccines lasts at least 3 years and probably longer. Early vaccines, which contained CAV-1, were associated with the development of corneal edema and glomerulonephritis in a small percentage (<1%) of immunized dogs. Replacement of attenuated live CAV-1 with CAV-2 occurred after 1980 and eliminated this complication.23 These vaccines have the potential to cause transient respiratory signs and tonsillitis in dogs if accidental inhalation occurs, so care should be taken not to aerosolize the vaccine during administration. Maternal antibody persists until puppies are 12 weeks of age and interferes with immunization when virus neutralization titers exceed 1:100. Vaccines should be administered every 3 to 4 weeks from 6 weeks of age, with the last vaccine given no earlier than 16 weeks of age (see Appendix). Vaccine virus may be shed from the respiratory tract by dogs after vaccination, which has the potential to immunize other dogs as well. It has been suggested that this phenomenon may have been responsible for the virtual disappearance of the disease in the dog population in regions where vaccination is widely performed.24\n",
