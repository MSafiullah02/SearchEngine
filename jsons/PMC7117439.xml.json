            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is caused by a single stranded RNA virus belonging to the Arteriviridae family (Meulenberg et al., 1994). PRRSV is endemic in most pig producing countries of the world. Infection with PRRSV causes reproductive disease in sows with abortions and stillbirths at all stages of gestation. In growing pigs, increased pre-weaning mortality, inappetance and respiratory disorders can be observed. PRRSV is considered a primary pathogen, but co-infections with bacterial or viral pathogens commonly occur and exacerbate the clinical symptoms in growing pigs (reviewed by Drew, 2000). As a consequence of both primary and secondary infections with PRRSV, significant economic losses and welfare problems are observed in the swine industry worldwide (Neumann et al., 2005).",

            "text": "PRRSV is divided into two genotypes, the European PRRSV and the North American PRRSV. These genotypes have a high degree of genetic divergence (Wensvoort et al., 1991, Collins et al., 1992; reviewed by Stadejek et al., 2013). The European genotype strains can be further divided into at least three subtypes: Pan-European subtype 1 and Eastern European subtypes 2 and 3 (Stadejek et al., 2008). The pathogenicity of European genotype subtype 1 strains and North American genotype strains has been studied several times. In general, North American genotype strains show a larger variation in pathogenicity than European genotype subtype 1 strains. In several experimental studies more severe respiratory disease has been observed with North American genotype strains (Halbur et al., 1995, Halbur et al., 1996, Van der Linden et al., 2003, Mart\u00ednez-Lobo et al., 2011; reviewed by G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2013, Han et al., 2013a, Han et al., 2013b). Only limited information is available about European subtype 2 and 3 strains. Subtype 3 strains were described to be more virulent than subtype 1 strains in experimentally infected pigs (Karniychuk et al., 2010, Morgan et al., 2013, Weesendorp et al., 2013a, Weesendorp et al., 2013b). In a previous study (Weesendorp et al., 2013a, Weesendorp et al., 2013b) we analysed the systemic responses of pigs after infection with two European subtype 1 strains, and one subtype 3 strain. The present study focuses specifically on the respiratory tract of these pigs, by characterizing the local immunological and pathological responses. It was shown that the subtype 3 strain Lena induced a stronger early inflammatory response which resulted in more severe clinical disease and lung pathology than observed after infection with subtype 1 strains Belgium A or Lelystad-Ter Huurne (LV). Interestingly, although subtype 1 strains did not induce clinical disease, these strains induced more severe long-term microscopic lung lesions to the infection than the subtype 3 strain. On the other hand, the early inflammatory response of strain Lena might have enhanced a faster clearance of virus than observed after infection with subtype 1 strains.",

Pigs were housed in four groups in different rooms of an isolation unit. Pigs were inoculated intranasally with 1.5 ml inoculum containing 105 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of either European subtype 1 strain Belgium A, strain LV, European subtype 3 strain Lena, or an equal volume of PBS (group control). In each group, four pigs were vaccinated with an Aujeszky's disease vaccine, but these pigs were excluded from the present study. At days 3, 7 and 35 post-infection (p.i.), four pigs per group were euthanized for post-mortem examination. Rectal temperatures and clinical symptoms were recorded daily. Viraemia was analysed in serum at days 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 26 and 33 p.i. Results of viraemia were presented in detail by Weesendorp et al. (2013a).

Consecutive 4 \u03bcm thick sections were cut and one was stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Other lung sections were used to determine the presence of PRRSV antigen in tissue and to characterize the infiltration of lymphocytic cells by staining CD3 positive cells. For immunohistochemical (IHC) detection, thin sections were mounted on poly-l-lysine coated slides, deparaffinised and treated with 3% hydrogen peroxidase to block endogenous peroxidase. To detect PRRSV antigen in the tissue slides, the monoclonal antibody SDOW17 (specific for the nucleocapsid antigen of PRRSV, Rural Technologies, Inc.\u00ae) was used. To detect CD3 expressing cells (only applied at days 3 and 7 p.i.), an anti-human CD3 antibody was used. Bound antibody was visualized by using the EnVison\u2122Detection system followed by incubation with diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogenic substrate, which results in a dark brown staining of bound primary antibody sites. Slides were counterstained with haematoxylin. A semi-quantitative, pathohistological assessment of the H&E stained slides was performed by one pathologist, who was blinded in regard of treatment. The examination encompassed the extent of pneumonia in each slide, i.e. presence of focal or diffuse alterations with interstitial or catarrhal pneumonia or atelectasis, the extent of infiltration of alveolar septae with mononuclear cells and the extent of infiltration of mononuclear cells in the perivascular/peribronchiolar area. A histological score from 0, i.e. no findings, 1 = mild focal manifestation, 2 = moderate, multifocal manifestation, 3 = moderate diffuse manifestation, 4 = severe diffuse manifestation and 5 = very severe extended manifestation was used to describe the severity of changes. To compare the histological findings between groups, the scores from each slide per lung were added to an overall score, which could add up to a maximum of 15.",

Concanavalin A (20 \u03bcg/ml [Sigma]) was used in triplicate wells as a positive control, and non-infected filtered PAM culture medium in triplicate wells as negative control (all 50 \u03bcl/well). Plates were incubated with 100 \u03bcl of anti-pig IFN-\u03b3 biotin-labelled mAb (BD) at a concentration of 0.17 \u03bcg/ml.

In the study of Morgan et al.

In the study of Morgan et al.

Although in the present study no gross pathology was observed at day 35 p.i., pigs had clear histological interstitial changes in the lungs. Interestingly, subtype 1 strains generated at day 35 p.i. more severe microscopic lung lesions to the infection than the subtype 3 strain. Thus, despite the absence of clinical symptoms or manifestations of pneumonia, PRRSV infection has induced long-term interstitial changes, which can contribute to a higher susceptibility to secondary infections, which potentially exacerbates clinical symptoms and pathology as observed in the field (reviewed by G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2013).",

In their study, they compared the pathogenicity of different European and North American genotype strains. Their results indicated that the North American genotype strains were more pneumovirulent than the European genotype strains, but that there were no differences in viral load. However, other authors, and also the results of the present study of IHC on lung tissue and viraemia levels point more to a relationship between pathogenicity and virus levels (Johnson et al., 2004; reviewed by G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2013, Han et al., 2013a, Han et al., 2013b, Han et al., 2014).

In pigs infected with highly pathogenic PRRSV strains, clinical disease was related to severe interstitial pneumonia and high expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in the lungs compared to less virulent PRRSV strains. IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 production cause chemotaxis of monocytes and neutrophils (Van Reeth and Nauwynck, 2000; reviewed by G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2013), of which we observed a higher percentage in BALF. Release of enzymes, free radicals and inflammatory cytokines from the neutrophils can then also contribute to the lung pathology (Han et al., 2014) that was observed after infection with strain Lena.",

            "text": "Type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) is rapidly produced in response to many viral infections such as swine influenza or porcine coronavirus (Van Reeth et al., 1999). IFN-\u03b1 is the prototypic antiviral cytokine that suppresses initial viral replication and promotes the adaptive immune response (reviewed by Kimman et al., 2009). For PRRSV, it has been shown in vitro that the type I IFN response is suppressed (Ait-Ali et al., 2011), but there are conflicting reports of PRRSV inhibiting or inducing a type I IFN response in vivo (Van Reeth et al., 1999; G\u00f3mez-Laguna et al., 2009). In blood (Weesendorp et al., 2013a, Weesendorp et al., 2013b), we observed an induction of IFN-\u03b1 of the Lena and Belgium A strain at day 7 p.i., when the virus load was at a peak level. Blood cells responded to the virus by an inflammatory response with production of IFN-\u03b1 and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. In tissues, however, we observed mostly a downregulation of IFN-\u03b1. Downregulation of IFN-\u03b1 in the tissues might be one of the mechanisms of the virus to facilitate PRRSV replication (Murtaugh et al., 2002).",
