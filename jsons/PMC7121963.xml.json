The delivery of these promised rights has been hampered by the State\u2019s citizen-centric allocation of responsibility and accountability.",

The remit is limited to States\u2019 obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill the right to health for within their borders (ICESCR 2000, General Comment 14).\nGovernments have a responsibility for the health of their people which can be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures. A main social target of governments, international organizations and the whole world community in the coming decades should be the attainment by all peoples of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permit them to lead a socially and economically productive life.

This trajectory highlights three points: first, that health is increasingly accepted as a universal right; second, that the international order as currently conceived and practiced holds national States responsible for the provision and protection of health security; and third, that non-citizens and cross-border coverage, prevention measures and eventually necessary intervention are not codified (see also Davies 2010; Davies et al. 2015).",

(2014) among others have written, \u201cincreased interdependence has eroded the capacity of states\u201d to meet their health security obligations to their own populations, to say nothing about non-citizens. As the GAP also noted,\nThe challenge is that in a world of sovereign states, there is no hierarchical authority or world government to fill in the gaps. Rather, there is only a relatively weak system of multilateral institutions built on the shaky foundations of the consent of sovereign states. (Frenk et al. 2014)Adding a further complication is the fact that these multilateral institutions, notably the WHO and its IHR (updated 2007), lack mandatory and effective implementation measures to ensure health security provisions if and when States fail to do so. Thus while States continue to assume the obligations of health security, they face constraints of both willpower\u2014including their own\u2014and capacity. Anyone who falls outside of the jurisdiction of State responsibility for health security1 is left vulnerable\u2014a vulnerability which can easily spread even to those who are \u2018secure\u2019 (Liotta and Owens 2006).2\n",

Sierra Leone and Liberia benefited both by being the secondary victims of the epidemic and from aid, though much of its impact is in dispute. Notably, it remains that first, the accountability for the given aid rests with the giver, not with the recipients: in other words, US (citizen) taxpayers can demand an accounting of the funds spent in West Africa since these are theirs, but West Africans cannot do the same although they were (to be) the beneficiaries of the monies, reinforcing the gap between the theory of sovereignty and citizenship divorced from the practical responsibility for health delivery; and second, notably given the uncertainty of the timing and effectiveness of the aid, it remains unclear what role such diplomatic and military aid had versus local interventions to end the Ebola epidemics.",

In spite of some \u2018 AIDS fatigue\u2019 and the crowding out of health security on some international agendas, the issue retains its salience and importance for human security. Indeed, health security is indisputably present on the international agenda (see UNSC; Trilateral Commission; G7; G20; European Council 2003).\nThe international discourse (at the UN, ICC, G7/G8) is beginning to effect change on the institutions and practice of global governance. \u2026Synergies between issues and the new coalitions that result have produced new forms of diplomatic action. Coalition building among like-minded states and nonstate actors is one dynamic element of this \u201cnew diplomacy.\u201d (Axworthy 2001, 20)This diplomacy operates at the traditional, bilateral level of State-to-State relations wherein the security of population health is evaluated in the service of the security of the State. Yet it also involves NSAs and NGOs in efforts to elevate health on the international agenda in what Luk van Langenhove (2016) calls \u2018science for diplomacy\u2019. Altogether, these trends and attendant initiatives have resulted in a proliferation of health security initiatives, spanning the whole range of State and human security definitions (Nunes 2014; Howell 2014; Mcinnes and Lee 2006; Kevany 2016; Kickbusch 2007). These reinforce the embeddedness of health security within human security, though their relationship(s) with State responsibility remain contested (Der Derian 1995, 28).",

Yet little movement has taken place to rearrange responsibility for health security beyond State borders.\nWhile disease, migration and borders are present in the EU variant of the new security discourse, the nature of concrete policy responses is determined by the differential development of EU powers. The centrality of health policy to electoral politics in all European countries has meant that control has largely been retained by states, and authority within European institutions is consequently relatively weak. (Bashford 2006, 164)Furthermore, EU Decision No 1082/2013 calls for only \u2018coordination\u2019 between Member States (European Commission 2013). It also calls for the extension of notification of threats as per Decision No 2119/98 to human health security at the EU level. Toward this end, the EU has set up the Health Security Committee (2001) on the basis of the Presidency Conclusions of 15 November on bioterrorism.

They prescribe capacities that countries should development to enable and reinforce disease outbreak response, and foster coordination among States toward \u201cthe preparedness for, and response to, a public health emergency of international concern\u201d (WHO 2005; European Commission 2013). However, far from all countries around the world have established even one \u2018core capacity\u2019: the African IHR website is currently unavailable (5 September 2017). Further crippling their effect is the IHR\u2019 lack of implementation tools, including sanction options if and when countries fail to comply and contribute. This endangers health security beyond their borders\u2014as when an outbreak becomes an epidemic which becomes a pandemic as in the case of the 2014\u20132015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The only incentive the IHR have is reputational: a country which complies with the requirements to notify the WHO of a suspected outbreak is spared public shaming and instead (ideally) rewarded with international acclaim for its forthright actions to protect international health security. When China failed to do so during the 2003 SARS epidemic, it was internationally condemned. When it did adhere to IHR guidelines during the H5N1 outbreak of 2005 and beyond, it was internationally lauded. Yet the IHR, like the EU decisions, rely on States to provide for health within their borders, and to enable other States to do the same in instances of cross-border penetration of disease outbreaks. None of these provisions present adequate measures to protect and provide for health security, for sedentary and/or migrant populations, beyond borders.",

Though they have a role to play, they retain their liability both in their capacity undermining State sovereign capacity (see Matthews, 1997; \u0160ehovi\u0107 2015) and in their predetermined focus on select disease threats. They can, however, play an important role in highlighting emerging health security threats. They seem, for instance, to work anti-cyclically: when a State cannot or refuses to engage against a particular disease threat, NSAs might fill the void (Risse 2012; Keck and Sikkink 1998). When the State assumes its responsibility, NSAs might dissipate. The risk remains in the (un)avoidable gap: when NSAs shift their focus onto other risks or threats and States fail to step in and take over their security guarantee (\u0160ehovi\u0107 2014). For example, as the HIV epidemic burgeoned in South Africa in the late 1990s to early 2000s, any response lay mostly in the hands of NSAs, including NGOs, civil society, and the business community and private industry (\u0160ehovi\u0107 2014). As the State assumed greater responsibility for treatment and care, many of these NSAs shifted their focus elsewhere. This worked as long as not another massive (health) demand overburdened the State\u2019s capacity to respond. Now, in 2017, South Africa faces a skyrocketing number of TB, including MDR and XDR, cases, as well as a surge in drug-resistant HIV infections.6 As during the early days of HIV, NSAs are providing much of the care and support.7 This time, however, there is little likelihood of the South African State stepping in, let alone to the extent that it did with HIV, again.8 That TB is airborne and therefore able to cross borders even more readily than HIV, affecting sedentary and migratory populations alike, should elevate the argument that removing myopia on borders and disease is all the more critical to imagining health security beyond borders.",

In this instance, it might be to have national States, as Member States of the UNSC and the WHO, sign preemptive agreements which foresee military intervention in the event that civilian actors, both national and non-State, invoke the need. The trouble with the WHO is that it is politically constrained; it must obtain governments\u2019 permission to work in their territory, as in Liberia. Therefore, such preliminary agreements directly between States and, for instance, a coalition of signatories to the FCGH might be useful on two counts in securing health and human security: first, to accelerate investment in civilian capacity could forestall the need for such an intervention having to be invoked; second, by establishing a priori which foreign militaries might come to the aid of which nations, for how long, and under what conditions. This might also prevent the national or international abuse of States of emergency or uninvited military intervention in the name of \u2018security\u2019 (\u0160ehovi\u0107 2016).",

(Davies et al. 2015)In order for any of these strategies to be successful, however, not only action but also accountability is required. As States remain the entities at which both human security per se and its provision and protection rest, the onus is on them to respond. This ups the ante for any response, for States to be seen \u2018doing something\u2019 (Davies et al. 2015, 123). The challenge then is not to equate \u2018doing something\u2019 as opposed to nothing with doing anything, but to customize the response to render it timely and effective. Such effectiveness is in turn predicated upon coordination, at the national, international, and global levels.",

As such, it focuses mostly on inter-State coordination. As argued above, this has two shortcomings based on the assumption that States are the final guarantor of human and thus of health security. First, States may or may not be able to meet their obligations toward human security. Second, they may actively neglect or even pursue aims contrary to the provision of human and health security. Particularly at risk are non-citizens. The ensuring gap cannot be filled by NSAs alone. Likewise, military intervention without prior coordination is a risky strategy with unproven (long-term) repercussions for the health and human security of both sedentary and migrant populations on all sides of borders to which it remains unaccountable. Consequently, a new global ordering of health and human security responsibilities premised on State but capturing non-State actions toward its realization is vitally necessary.",
