The goal of operative treatment is to prevent long-term scoliosis progression by effective correction of the coronal, sagittal, and rotational deformities with minimal fusion levels, maintaining appropriate coronal and sagittal balance1.

The PSF/PI in severe cases is fraught with risks and limitations of correction. Therefore, a search for better management is required. Some reinforcements were considered, for example, (1) an anterior release beforehand6, (2) staged posterior operation, (3) osteotomy, such as Smith-Petersen osteotomy (SPO), pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO), or vertebral column resection (VCR), (4) traction methods, such as preoperative halo-gravity traction, intraoperative halo-femoral traction7. Among the above methods, the staged anterior release and PSF/PI capable of three-dimensional correction with increased flexibility were most adopted. In the past, the anterior release was performed through an open thoracotomy. Nonetheless, it was later replaced by multi-portal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) because of relative minor invasiveness with equal therapeutic effectiveness. The safety and efficacy of multi-portal VATS for anterior approach were later proven by Lenke6 and Bullmann et al.8, recommended the relative indications for severe, stiff curves, severe lordosis or hypokyphosis, and severely immature patients9. In a biomechanical cadaveric study, Wollowick10 showed that anterior release generated significantly more thoracic rotation than posterior osteotomy and maximized three-dimensional correction. However, the invention of pedicle screw largely increases the structural stability of PSF/PI, and there is a doubt on the necessity of adding an anterior approach for severe cases. Several studies11\u201313 have demonstrated that two-stage anterior/posterior surgery has only a limited advantage in terms of correction, while the disadvantages and complications of anterior release could be avoided by the posterior-only approach. To sum up, the controversies exist whether the benefits outweigh the possible complications from the anterior operation.",

Previous studies15,16 have shown the UniVATS is non-inferior to conventional multi-portal VATS in the safety and therapeutic effects of lung cancer. Moreover, the UniVATS has potential advantages15\u201318 of reduced access trauma, less pain, fewer complication and faster recovery.

The patient was placed in the lateral decubitus position with the thoracic convex side up, and an axillary roll was placed under the downside. The placement of the incision was crucial in light of curvature types, the distance between the apex and the chest wall, and lung abnormalities if any. After the C-arm localization, a small incision was usually made at the intercostal space on the middle axillary line toward the apex of the curvature. A 5-mm 30-degree thoracoscopy (Olympus) was inserted in the posterior part of the incision to obtain the most exquisite anatomic view. To maintain the position of the camera posteriorly to the patient, a suture around the camera to pull it back was suggested16.

He received total correction surgery for TOF at the age of 11 months and pulmonary stent insertion (Arrows on Fig. 3) for pulmonary stenosis at the age of 10 years. The growth hormone deficiency was treated with Genotropin, and the measured skeletal bone age was 13.5 years old with Risser sign 1. The rapid progression of AIS led to severe back pain and restrictive ventilatory defect, which forced us to consider corrective surgery before skeletal maturity. His thoracic and lumbar spine deformities were 96\u00b0 and 28\u00b0 (Fig. 3a), respectively. The residual thoracic curve on the side bending film was 92\u00b0 (Fig. 3c,d), only with 4% improvement, indicative of poor flexibility. After discussion with paediatricians, cardiovascular surgeons, thoracic surgeons and anaesthesiologists, the two-stage surgery was the treatment of choice, including UniVATS for anterior releases (T7\u201311) and PSF/PI (T4\u2013L3). The prior cardiovascular surgery adhesions would not interfere with the UniVATS. He had one-night stay in the ICU due to high cardiopulmonary risk and was discharged on the fifth postoperative day. At the latest postoperative follow-up (18 months postoperatively), he did not experience any discomfort, and the corrected curvature maintained. His thoracic and lumbar curves were corrected to 20\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, indicating 79% and 86% improvement, respectively (Fig. 3e).",

Arlet et al.21 performed a meta-analysis of 10 studies with a total of 151 cases received conventional multi-portal VATS and posterior spine fusion. The percentage of coronal Cobb angle correction was 55\u201363% with 18% complication rate. The most frequent complications were pulmonary events that required prolonged ventilator support. Al-Sayyad et al.22 reported that 70 cases received conventional multi-portal VATS for anterior release, followed by posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation. The percentage of coronal Cobb angle correction was 68% (range, 41\u201391%) with 11% complication rate, with pulmonary complications in 3 out of 8 patients. Table 2 summarized these studies, whereas, the kyphotic correction was not presented due to the heterogeneity in different investigations. The average levels of anterior release through conventional approaches were much more than that in our UniVATS technique (3.6 \u00b1 0.7). However, a learning curve was warranted. The first case in our series had only three levels released. Through mastering the technique in a short time, our team could increase the levels of releasing.",

            "text": "Speedier operation, minimal blood loss, less requirement of stay in ICU or chest tube placement, faster narcotic-free recovery and earlier ambulation in one day pointed out the multifaceted surgical advantages of UniVATS. Because of more accessible to the lung through subcutaneous fat with less burden in high-risk patients23, the relative indications for UniVATS in thoracic surgery include high BMI or compromised cardiopulmonary function24. Our case of TOF exemplifies the safety and feasibility of this technique. However, the hospital stay might be longer (9.8 \u00b1 2.3 days) because of Taiwan National Health Insurance allows patients to hospitalize longer for recovery. The intercostal nerve blockade and drainless protocol further expedited the recovery. Hung et al.25 showed that the popularity of regional blockades reduced postoperative narcotics requirement, which impeded lung expansion and obstructed recovery. Less access trauma of UniVATS together with intercostal nerve blockade make narcotic-free recovery possible in our institute. On the other hand, the placement of the chest tube potentially caused wound pain and precluded patients from early ambulation and discharge. Yang et al.26 reported that drainless UniVATS was safe with reduced postoperative pain and hospital stay. Therefore, this protocol was routinely practiced in our institute. The halo-gravity traction and halo-femoral traction commonly used in the staged operations were not practiced in our cases, resulting in better comforts, faster recovery and fewer complications. For example, pressure sores, stiffness of the hip and knees due to the longer bed rest and more extended hospitalization had been reported27. Despite extremely severe preoperative curvatures, our study provided non-inferior surgical outcomes. UniVATS contributed to adequate correction with fewer complications and faster recovery. To the best of our knowledge, the benefits of UniVATS for anterior release outweighed the potential risks.",

            "text": "In addition to the minimal incision and faster recovery with comparable coronal and sagittal correction, UniVATS exceeds conventional multi-portal anterior approaches in view of techniques of demands. The single-port design of UniVATS has a simultaneous introduction of the instruments in line of the scope, which offers another advantage to surgeons with the parallel visual field as an open approach. The conventional multi-portal VATS had a dihedral or torsion angle between the instruments and the geometric plane of the scope, which represented an impediment to the depth visualization on the flat two-dimensional vision of monitors. On the contrary, in the case of UniVATS, all the instruments are scattered on the geometric plane of the scope that preserves the depth of intraoperative visualization. To maximize the advantages, it is suggested28 that keeping the geometric plane of the scope as close as possible to the plane of the instruments, producing a surgical field of view that equal to the open thoracotomy when facing the patient\u2019s anterior chest. We avoided setting incision too anterior because the mediastinum, deflated lung, and surrounding vessels limited the accessibility to the spine29. As a result, the spatial advantage of UniVATS flattens the substantial learning curve in conventional multi-portal VATS that requires enormous time and effort to overcome. The previous study24 showed that UniVATS was not so different from an open approach, and the transition to UniVATS could be less traumatic than to a conventional multi-portal VATS.",

Because of high population coverage of the National Health Insurance, scoliotic patients could be detected and treated earlier in Taiwan. The cases of severe scoliosis curves were so rare that our sample size was relatively small. Moreover, the anterior releasing procedures to the level far from the incision would be incomplete due to larger access angle. Therefore, the maximum release-level was limited to four or five levels according to the size of chest cavity. The development of angled surgical instruments potentially facilitates the accessibility to distal discs. The long-term follow-up and prospective clinical trials at larger scale should be conducted. Despite these limitations in the study design, our study did offer convincing evidence and valuable information for this novel approach in the management of severe scoliosis.",
