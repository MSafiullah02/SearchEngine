But after the development of a new generation sequencing, technologies and advance computational approach researchers are looking forward for a complete understanding of microbes and host interactions. The powerful sequencing platform is rapidly transforming the landscape of microbial identification and characterization. As bioinformatics analysis tools and databases are easily available to researchers, the enormous amount of data generated can be meaningfully handled for better understanding of the microbial world.

Although many are not harmful, a few cause life-threatening diseases. Traditionally these are identified by culturing in appropriate media, biochemical analysis, and serological testing. However, more numbers of microbes are yet to be characterized than are known. Through the human body, microbes play vital roles in all of their ecosystems (Hentges 1993) . In spite of being extremely small, the sheer numbers of microbes living on the planet have large effects on the cycling of nutrients and compounds, essential for the survival of all organisms.",

The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, and a few are beneficial. In fact, the relationship between microbes and humans is delicate and complex. Ten times as many microbes live on or inside your body. The microbes living in our digestive system break down food and produce useful vitamins. The millions of microbes that coat our skin and intestinal lumen form a protective barrier against more dangerous microbes. Without them, our bodies would be open to microbial attack. In spite of these benefits, a relatively small number of microbes are harmful to humans. Many diseases and epidemics are caused by microbes: the plague during the Middle Ages, smallpox, AIDS, influenza, food poisoning, and anthrax. These diseases result in severe illness, or even death. As scientists learn more about bacteria, fungi, and viruses, they are better able to treat and prevent these diseases ).",

In 1957, Thailand had to appeal for aid because many buffaloes had died, due to which paddy fields could not be prepared for rice. In India, spread of rinderpest was controlled by numerous eradication programs throughout the twentieth century (Barrett et al. 2006) .

Many viral diseases have been eradicated from globe by taking effective control measures. Smallpox was the first viral disease to be eradicated globally followed by Rinderpest or cattle plague. In the last 30 years or so, about 40 new viral diseases have been identified (Zappa et al. 2009 ). A recent study has shown that by 2020, about 10 new human diseases would emerge compared to the past, and mobility of humans and animals have increased; with this, rate of spread of disease has also increased (Morens and Fauci 2013) . It has become vital to have an arsenal of diagnostic techniques which can identify a pathogen whether new or old in shortest possible time to combat effective control measures. New technologies are being developed in molecular biology at a very rapid rate and many of them are being applied in diagnosis. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is once such technique which was developed for amplification of a fragment of DNA in the early 1980s (Mullis 1990) . The PCR and related techniques like real-time PCR are now the most widely used molecular method for the detection and identification of viruses (Espy et al. 2006) . Multiplex PCR allows detection of more than one species of virus in a single assay (Elnifro et al. 2000) . However, these techniques have limitations of multiplexibility and versatility and require extensive prior knowledge of the sequences to be amplified ).",

(2009) developed a microarray assay for identifying viruses that cause vesicular or vesicular-like lesions in livestock animals. They were able to differentiate foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), swine vesicular disease virus, vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV), BHV-1, orf virus, pseudocowpox virus, bluetongue virus serotype 1, and bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV1). Leblanc and co-researcher (2009) used magnetic bead microarray for the rapid detection and identification of the four recognized species in the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, i.e., classical swine fever virus, border disease virus, and BVDV1 and 2, which allowed specific and sensitive virus detection. They concluded that based on the simplicity of the assay, the protocols for hybridization and magnetic bead detection offer an emerging application for molecular diagnosis in virology that is amenable for use in a modestly equipped laboratory. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) were detected in a cDNA microarray (Liu et al. 2006) . GreenChip array facilitated the discovery of Ebola virus, in the porcine respiratory illness outbreak in the Philippines (Barrette et al. 2009 ). These chips have also been used for screening veterinary clinical samples (Mihindukulasuriya et al. 2008) . Canine coronavirus (CCoV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), turkey enteritis coronavirus (TCoV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and human respiratory coronavirus (HRCoV) are identified based on microarray hybridization (Chen et al. 2010) . Sharma et al. (2012) have designed microarray chip for identification of animal viruses; the chip successfully identified the new castle disease virus in sheep and mixed infection of bovine viral diarrhea 2 and bovine herpes virus 1 (Ratta et al. 2013 ) in cattle.",

The basic principle involved in DNA microarrays is the reverse of Southern blot (Southern 1975) . Unlike Southern blot where targets are immobilized and a probe is labeled, in DNA microarray, probes are immobilized on a membrane and then hybridized against the labeled target population (Kurian et al. 1999 ). Since unlike Southern blot, in microarray, target is labeled not probes, target can be hybridized to a large number of probes and consequently microarray chips have the capacity to simultaneously detect tens or hundreds or thousands of specific nucleic acid targets present in biological samples in a single experiment (Schena et al. 1995) . Microarrays have been used in a large number of applications such as genome-wide genotyping, expression profiling, RNA detection, protein arrays, and pathogen nucleic acid detections (Petricoin et al. 2002 ).",

Besides specificity probe designing requires consideration of many other factors, which influence hybridization processes such as guanine/cytosine (G/C) content, melting point, secondary structure, sequence specificity, polynucleotide tract, and probe length. Probe length affects the sensitivity and specificity of hybridization, while other factors contribute to nonspecific hybridization. Maximizing the specificity and the sensitivity are often conflicting goals in terms of achieving probe design. Some well-known examples for microarray chips are as follows.",

            "text": "One of the very first microarray chips to utilize a generalized computational algorithm to find conserved regions among viral pathogens was by Wang et al. (2002) . The oligonucleotide probe length used in this chip was 70-mer. The chip based on this conserved sequence was used to identify a coronavirus from the then unknown SARS-coronavirus samples. Chou et al. (2006) developed a comprehensive algorithm for designing conserved probes. They assumed that a virus genus (G) is a collection of n viruses, in which each virus v i (i \u00bc 1, . . ., n) is associated with a subset of G. Comparison of this virus with another virus in the genus identifies similar sequences. The similarity was defined as having either (i) more than 75% local sequence similarity in a 50-bp window with any virus or (ii) >15 consecutive bases pairing. From these set of conserved sequences, those sets are picked up which would identify the entire virus in the genus alone or in combination. It was not necessary that a single conserved sequence would pick up the entire virus in the genus. From the conserved sequences, 70-mer conserved probe were selected based on the following criteria: (i) GC content between 40% and 60%, (ii) <5 continuous mononucleotide repeats, (iii) <25-bp BLASTN sequence identity matches, and (iv) 15 consecutive bases pairing with other viral sequences in the noncognate viral genus (Chou et al. 2006) . Jabado et al. (2008) used protein families database (Pfam) as the basis for designing conserved oligonucleotide probes. Their strategy for finding conserved region entails identifying short conserved region and corresponding nucleic acid region. First they identified most conserved nonoverlapping 20 amino acids sequences then extracted corresponding nucleotide sequences. If the gaps were found, the flanking regions were taken into account. The sequences which were not part of Pfam were extracted and homologous gene clustered. All clustered sequence was searched for common motifs with software such as MEME. Three motifs were selected for each sequence cluster. The nucleic acid sequence extracted for each protein motif was used for probe design. The conditions for probe design were 5 mismatches to the template, a T m >60 C, no repeats exceeding a length of 10 nt, no hairpins with stem lengths exceeding 11 nt, and <33% overall sequence identity to non-viral genomes (Jabado et al. 2008) .",

The clinical samples for microarray analysis are collected in solutions (like RNAlater) which makes RNA stable or directly in trizol for RNA isolation (Wang et al. 2002; Chiu et al. 2007) . Samples for microarrays are generally processed by the methods adopted by Wang et al. (2002) . This method employs anchored random nonamer primers for cDNA synthesis, nonspecific amplification, and introduction of aminoallyl nucleotide into the amplification product. Labeling is done by covalent binding of fluorescent dye (cyanine with aminoallyl group of nucleotide (Jabado et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2002; Gardner et al. 2010) . Hybridization is done overnight, and the temperature of hybridization is defined by the probe sequences which vary between 65 C and 70 C (Tan et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2003; Jayaraman et al. 2006; Gardner et al. 2010) . Hybridization signals are generated by using light of a predefined wavelength to stimulate the emission of the fluorescent signal. The amount of emission is determined by the amount of fluorescent dyes bound, which is correlated with the amount of targets-probe hybrids at the spot.",

            "text": "Virus prediction from the signal intensity data has been the subject of intense study. Unlike gene expression microarrays, diagnostic microarrays have no up or downregulated gene. In diagnostic microarray, a signal cannot be low, high, or unchanged; it has to be defined in binary numbers-present or absent, on or off. A signal is defined as present if it is above a predefined cutoff. This cutoff signal has arrived differently as the microarray technology for diagnosis developed. In the first broadspectrum microarray chip, the control hybridization was carried out with the RNA from uninfected cell culture. In this particular chip, each spot was spiked with a known probe in a fixed ratio to normalize the expression of all the probes. The complementary sequence of the spike probe was labeled with Cy3 dye. Two color hybridization experiments were done for both infected and uninfected cell culture. The Cy5 signal for each probe was normalized against Cy3 signal. Cy5 labeledinfected and uninfected signal for each probe were calculated; from these values, a value of 1500 was arbitrarily defined as cutoff value, and the prediction was based on aggregate hybridization (Wang et al. 2003) . In diagnostic arrays, it is not always possible to have controls for identifying cutoff value like Wang et al. (2003) where they used mock-infected cell culture as control. To overcome this control problem, random probes which have no sequence similarity with NR database have been introduced (Gardner et al. 2010) . If control samples are available, they are used for calculating the cutoff value; otherwise signal intensity of random probes is used for calculating cutoff value. The cutoff value is kept at median + 2 SD of the random probe signal intensity, 95-99% percentile of random signal intensity (Gardner et al. 2010) . The virus identification from the signal intensity data makes use of different approaches. The simplest approach for predicting presence of virus in the sample is based on averaging signal intensity of all the probes of a virus or virus genus/family: if it is above a cutoff value, virus is predicted to be present; the other approach is based on the number/percentage of probes giving positive signal above a preset threshold (Sharma et al. 2012; Yadav et al. 2015) . The first broad-spectrum virusdetecting microarray chip, ViroChip, made prediction based on the aggregate hybridization pattern (Wang et al. 2003) . Chou et al. (2006) adopted similar criteria but with some modifications. Their method makes use of both signal intensity and a number of probes for making prediction. First, sum of all the signal intensity of a probe set is calculated, and then this is divided by the maximum intensity obtained for any group in the probe set. Based on the percentage, prediction is made. For the GreenChip , virus prediction was done by a specially developed software called Green-LAMP. This software subtracts background values from the probe intensities, calculate Z-score from log intensities by dividing with standard deviation and compute tail probabilities (p-value) assuming log normality. Presence of a positive or negative signal is computed from a fixed P-value threshold, 0.1 for arrays with matched controls and 0.023 otherwise. The background levels are derived from matched control samples or from random 60-mer control probes if matched control samples are not present. The following assumptions were made for making predictions: (1) spot intensities are normally distributed, (2) spots represent independent observations, and (3) there are relatively few (<100) positive probes for any given virus. DetectiV (Watson et al. 2007 ) tool was developed for handling array data by selecting groups of probes comprising a species, genus, or family and computing a one-sample t-test with null hypothesis that log intensity ratio for each group is zero. PhyloDetect (Rehrauer et al. 2008) , another tool for making virus prediction, converts the probe intensities to binary indicators (e.g., by thresholding against the median + 2 SD of the background intensities). In Pan-Microbial Detection Array (MDA) (Gardner et al. 2010) , the threshold for positive signal was kept at 99th percentile of negative controls which were randomly generated probes. Prediction for presence or absence of a pathogen was based upon two conditional probabilities: the probability of observing a signal in the presence of a specific microbial target in sample and the probability of observing signal in the absence of microbial target in the sample. Liu et al. (2006) compared five different methods of virus prediction and concluded that hypergeometric distribution and log transform ranking method give good prediction, but other methods like the number of probes with a threshold or ratio method also give suitable prediction.",

Detection of DNA is now possible on a single molecule, and high-throughput analysis allows thousands of detection reactions to be performed at once, thus allowing a range of characteristics to be rapidly and simultaneously determined. Some of the recent molecular detection methods can be performed in the laboratory or clinical settings and also at the farm site.

It is a derivation of conventional microbial genomics, with the key difference being that it bypasses the requirement for obtaining pure cultures for sequencing. Metagenomics holds the promise of revealing the genomes of the majority of microorganisms that cannot be readily obtained in pure form. Since the samples are obtained from communities rather than isolated populations, metagenomics may serve to establish hypotheses concerning interactions between community members. This process begins with sample and metadata collection and proceeds with DNA extraction, library construction, sequencing, read preprocessing, and assembly. Community composition analysis is employed at several stages of this workflow, and databases and computational tools are used to facilitate the analysis. Advances in the throughput and costefficiency of sequencing technology are fueling a rapid increase in the number and size of metagenomics datasets being generated. However, bioinformaticists are faced with the problem of how to handle and analyze these datasets in an efficient and useful way (Tringe and Rubin 2005) . The goal of metagenomics studies is to get a basic understanding of the microbial world both surrounding us and within us.",

The three nucleic acid sequence archives GenBank, EMBL-Bank, and DDBJ have spearheaded the cause of free availability of sequence information. In the process sequences of a large number of fragments have been registered in the international DNA databanks. However, the details of function of the sequence are not available and are of limited use. Analysis and comparison of complex metagenomic data is driving the development of a new class of bioinformatics and visualization software. The field is moving forward rapidly, driven by enormous improvements in sequencing technology and the availability of many complementary technologies.

Recently the next-generation sequencing platforms have made possible massive parallel sequencing without the need for lengthy electrophoresis. There are various approaches for next-generation sequencing like sequencing by hybridization, microelectrophoresis, cyclic array sequencing and real-time observation of single molecules. These diverse approaches and sophistication of next-generation sequencing have brought great challenges for bioinformaticists to tackle alignment, sequence scoring, data assembly, storage, and release of huge amounts of data (Kunin et al. 2008) .",

Proof of concept has already been shown in at least two cases where DNA microarray identified pathogen when all the other method for diagnosis failed. Currently the biggest problems in designing probes for diagnostic arrays are in designing conserved probes at genus level. In viral genera, getting conserved probes which would identify all the virus in the genus is next to impossible for almost all genera; as a consequence genus has to be arbitrarily subdivided based upon sequence conservation within the genus. This strategy has not been adopted though in MDA array the probes have been selected based upon conservation but not on uniqueness within a subgroup. Another problem with using microarray is the sequence heterogeneity within the virus species. All the unique probes of a virus species would not bind to all the isolates so a threshold has to be set for making prediction. The capacity of chips is going up, the new-generation chips can incorporate a million probes, while the number of viruses reported in ICTV is just above 2000; however the number of virus sequence reported and stored in NCBI database is in hundreds of thousands. Thus it is possible to make probes for all the sequences and incorporate them in a chip, but doing that would create problems in interpretation of results because of cross-hybridization signals.",

Microarray is costly as camper to PCR, and so it is generally restricted to the few commercial laboratories that can possess the capital, or those laboratories developing expertise in this field. This is a long procedure for the numbers of genes involved in this technique. ViroChip pan-viral microarray recently used deep sequencing technology to 17 respiratory samples collected from individuals infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus early during the pandemic and deep sequencing which can test for thousands of potential pathogens simultaneously. Consequently diagnostic strategy of rapid ViroChip-based testing followed by deep sequencing could show to be a useful public health response to infectious disease outbreaks in the future (Yadav et al. 2014) . Thus, identifying viral species using the previously reported viral microarray probe design strategy with new approaches is very impressive. The use of microarray in pathogen identification is still an intensive area of research. The new design strategies are constantly coming up. It is hoped that in near future a very precise and cost-effective chip would be developed, but to increase its practical usage in clinical microbiology laboratories, it has to become more affordable, be convenient to handle, and be accurate.",
