Little information is available about the main characteristics of patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19. A retrospective cohort study in hospitalized Chinese patients found that a majority of patients were men with a median age of 56 years and a 28% mortality rate [1] . Another recent US study in 5,700 patients found a median age of 63 years with mainly men (80.3%) and arterial hypertension (56.6%), obesity (41.7%) and diabetes (33.8%) as main comorbidities [2] . A case series of critically ill patients in Italy found that the majority were older men, requiring mechanical ventilation and high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure with 26% of mortality [3] .",

Because some drugs could interact with the SARS-Cov-2 replication, some authors suggested that these drug exposures could be beneficial or harmful for COVID-19 patients. Among the pharmacological hypotheses, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] and angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARB] alias sartans) or incretin-based drugs (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1 agonists] and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors [DDP-4 inhibitors]) were proposed as a potential factors modifying SARS-Cov-2 infectivity [4] [5] [6] . Therefore, there is an urgent need to assess what is the drug exposure of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs. Here, we described the demographics, baseline comorbidities, drug exposures and outcomes of the first COVID-19 patients admitted to Toulouse University Hospital ICUs.",

Several interesting points should be discussed. and metformin (1 patient out of 6). The fact that paracetamol was in first place before NSAIDs is probably explained by the campaign carried out at the beginning of the infection about the potential risks of NSAIDs (4) . Of course, due to the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, ACEIs, ARBs, diuretics, beta-blocking agents and calcium channel inhibitors were widely found in this study. Among drugs acting on the reninangiotensin system, ARBs were prescribed twice as much as ACEIs. It is interesting to underline that no death was observed in patients treated by ACEIs. While in our sample of patients with hypertension, we found a higher rate of intubation among patients exposed to ARBs (95%) compared to patients with ACEIs (60%), no conclusion can be made. In fact, today, there is no clear evidence neither for a deleterious nor a favorable effect of ACEI/ARB in this situation.

However, our observational study suggests potential differences between ARBs and ACEIs for the risk of intubation in COVID-19 patients. A recent observational study, involving patients who had been hospitalized in 11 countries on three continents, found that use of ACEIs may be associated with a lower risk of in-hospital death than non use (OR = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54\uf05d) while for ARBs, odds ratio J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74) versus non-use [8] . In addition in our sample of COVID-19 patients with diabetes, a lower rate of intubation was observed in patients treated by DPP4-inhibitors (43%) compared to those not exposed (81%).",

This is particularly the case for smoking (only found in around 1 patient out of 16), for which a possible protective effect is currently discussed [9] . Since our work is a descriptive study, it also probably suffers from the indication bias (as well as for the lack of comparator). This work should be completed by other further investigations performed on larger French cohorts. However, this study, which reflects a particular situation in a university hospital in France, offers interesting perspectives for future research in the field of COVID-19 infection, particularly for future pharmacoepidemiological studies, since it is the first performed in France in such patients.",

Moreover, the three first diseases associated to COVID-19 infection were arterial hypertension (around 1 patient out of 2) followed by diabetes (almost 1 patient out of 3) and other cardiovascular diseases (other than arterial hypertension; around 1 patient out of 6). These results are in agreement with previous studies published all around the world [1-3, 7]. Second, we investigated home drugs in COVID-19 patients admitted to an ICU. The 3 first drugs found in the admitted patients were paracetamol (1 patient out of 3) followed by ARB (1 patient out of 4)",
