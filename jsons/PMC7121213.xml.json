The emergence of highly pathogenic H5N1 and H7N9 avian IAV strains predominately across Asia has caused sporadic infections in humans with high mortality. The mouse model of IAV infection provides a convenient system to examine virus replication, disease pathogenesis and the inflammatory response elicited following intranasal infection of mice with IAV. Mice are not naturally infected with IAV, and intranasal inoculation with human seasonal strains leads to replication of the virus in the upper and lower respiratory tract but it generally does not result in severe disease [1, 2]. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1, H7N9, H9N2, and H4N8 viruses, and the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus are capable of inducing disease in mice without the requirement of prior adaptation [3, 4].",

The mouse adapted A/PR/8/34 (PR8) strain has been widely used in studies examining disease pathogenesis and the immune responses elicited following IAV infection of mice. PR8 was adapted to mice by >300 sequential passages in mouse lung [7] and is therefore highly virulent for mice, resulting in rapid weight loss and high mortality follow inoculation with as low as 50 plaque-forming units (PFU) [1, 5]. During the process of adaption, it was likely that PR8 acquired mutations associated with increased replication efficiency in the respiratory tract of mice and/or evasion of innate host responses. For example, PR8 is largely poor in its ability to infect macrophages, which are permissive to viral replication [1, 8]. HKx31 (H3N2) is a high-yielding reassortant of PR8 that expresses the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) from the Hong Kong pandemic of 1968. Unlike the mouse-adapted PR8 strain, HKx31 is similar to many pathogenic IAV strains such as H5N1 and H7N9 in its ability to infect macrophages [9, 10].",

Viral clearance is generally achieved 7\u201310 days after sublethal infection. Severe IAV infections of mice (i.e., following inoculation with mouse-adapted or HPAI viruses) are associated with a number of pathological features such as high viral loads, greater numbers of inflammatory infiltrate and elevated levels of inflammatory mediators [1, 2]. Vascular leak and pulmonary edema are hallmark pathological features of acute respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and have been observed during severe IAV infection of mice and humans [1, 11].",

Innate immune recognition receptor such as Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7 [12, 13], have all been shown to play important roles in recognizing IAV infection and initiating inflammation as a response to infection. Increasing evidence from our and other laboratories also identifies a critical role for the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat-containing (NLR) family of pattern-recognition molecules in inducing inflammation and contributing the pathophysiology and disease outcome during IAV challenge.",

            "text": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is an oligomeric innate immune intracellular signaling complex that senses many pathogen-, host-, and environmental-derived factors [14]. Inflammasome-induced cytokine release requires two signals: (1) upregulation of components of the NLRP3 inflammasome and synthesis of pro-IL-1\u03b2 through activation of the prototypic inflammatory transcription factor NF-\u03baB; and (2) inflammasome formation that results in IL-1\u03b2 maturation and secretion. Following activation, NLRP3 binds to the adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). ASC further recruits the enzyme caspase-1 to form the inflammasome complex initiating autocatalytic cleavage of caspase-1. The NLRP3 inflammasome is now recognized as a major route by which the innate immune system recognizes and responds during IAV infection [14]. To date, IAV single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and proton flux via the IAV-encoded matrix-2 (M2) ion channel have been shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome [15, 16], which is important in the development of adaptive immune responses to IAV. Studies utilizing mice lacking components of the NLRP3 inflammasome have demonstrated its importance in eliciting rapid protective responses following infection with PR8 [15, 17]. Recently, we identified that the PB1-F2 protein from the PR8 and H7N9 strains of IAV induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in mice via intranasal inoculation, contributing to severe disease pathophysiology [18, 19]. Importantly, intranasal delivery of a small molecule inhibitor of NLRP3 provided protection from PR8- and HKx31-induced lethality, commensurate with reduced lung inflammatory cytokine expression such as IL-6, MCP-1, TNF\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 reduced inflammatory cellular infiltrates [5].",

If in doubt, remove the mouse and check if it is anaesthetized. If it is still breathing rapidly or shows signs of movement, reexpose to isoflurane in the jar. If the mouse is not anaesthetized enough or too deeply, the mouse will not inhale the virus inoculum or PBS through its nostrils.Monitoring signs of clinical disease is a crucial ethical aspect of responsible monitoring of mice and animal welfare. All animal experimentation should be conducted in accordance with local ethics committee requirements which may vary. Always check with your institutional ethics and biosafety committee to obtain the relevant documentation and information relating to ethical handling and experimentation on animals and their scoring matrix and level of clinical signs of disease before ethical euthanasia of animals is required.As an alternative to >10 mg/kg injection of pentobarbitone, mice can be euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. Cervical dislocation as a method of euthanasia is not recommended, however, as it can cause bleeding around the lung.\n",
