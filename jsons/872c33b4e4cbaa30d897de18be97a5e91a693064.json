            "text": "There is uncertainty if current models for the Covid-19 pandemic should already take into account seasonality. That is because current environmental factors do not provide a powerful explanation of such seasonality, especially given climate differences between countries with moderate climates. It is hypothesized that one major factor is overlooked: pollen count. Pollen are documented to invoke strong immune responses and might create an environmental factor that makes it more difficult for flu-like viruses to survive outside a host. This Dutch study confirms that there is a (highly) significant inverse correlation between pollen count and weekly changes in medical flu consults, and that there is a highly significant inverse correlation between hay fever incidence, as measured by prescribed medication revenues, and weekly flu consults. This supports the idea that pollen are a direct or indirect factor in the seasonality of flu-like epidemics. If seasonality will be observed during the covid-19 spread as well, it is not unlikely that pollen play a role.",

Further, it is observed that these strains of viruses have a lower reproduction factor in tropical countries, outside the rain season. It is observed that possible inhibiting environmental factors in these epidemics are UV light (Schuit et al., 2020) , temperature and humidity (Chong et al., 2020) and behavioral changes during the seasons (Gozzi et al., 2020) . None of these environmental factors seems to be completely satisfactory to explain the seasonality of flu-like epidemics, which is very important to understand in the light of ongoing modelling efforts for the current Covid-19 pandemic.",

Further, pollen play a well-researched role in triggering human immune responses. To hypothesize in what ways pollen could be an environmental factor influencing the life cycle of flu-like epidemics, the objective of this quick study is to falsify the hypothesis that there are no significant inverse correlations between pollen counts, pollen induced immune responses, and flu-like epidemic life cycles in The Netherlands.
