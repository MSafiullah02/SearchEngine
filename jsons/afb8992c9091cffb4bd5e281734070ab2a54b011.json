            "text": "Calculation of infectious viral titers represents a basic and essential experimental approach for virologists. Classical plaque assays cannot be used for viruses that do not cause significant cytopathic effects, which is the case for strains 229E and OC43 of human coronavirus (HCoV). An alternative indirect immunoperoxidase assay (IPA) is herein described for the detection and titration of these viruses. Susceptible cells are inoculated with serial logarithmic dilutions of samples in a 96-well plate. After viral growth, viral detection by IPA yields the infectious virus titer, expressed as \"Tissue Culture Infectious Dose\" (TCID 50 ). This represents the dilution of a virus-containing sample at which half of a series of laboratory wells contain replicating virus. This technique is a reliable method for the titration of HCoV in biological samples (cells, tissues, or fluids).",

As described by McIntosh (4), the identification of coronaviruses in clinical samples was a very difficult task until the 1970s, as HCoV induced subtle or nonexistent cytopathic effects, and many cells types were not susceptible to the virus. Commonly Interestingly, cells from the central nervous system (CNS) were reported to be highly susceptible to HCoV replication. The SK-N-SH (ATCC: HTB-11) neuroblastoma and H4 (ATCC: HTB-148) neuroglioma cell lines were highly susceptible to infection, as well as astrocytoma cell lines U-87 MG (ATCC: HTB-14), U-373 MG, and GL-15 (5-8). Even though it was reported that HCoV-229E infectious titers could be determined by plaque assay on specific cell lines, such as MRC-5 or L-132 (6), this proved not to be a reliable assay and, as for HCoV-OC43, an alternative assay was required: an indirect immunoperoxidase assay (IPA) on coronavirus-susceptible cells to quantify infectious virus in biological samples.",

The principle of the IPA technique is that a specific antibody recognizes and binds to its specific antigen to yield an antibody-antigen complex. For detection of these complexes, the primary antibody is either directly labeled with HRP or remains unlabeled, with detection achieved by a labeled secondary antibody. If a secondary antibody is used, it must be generated against the immunoglobulins of the animal species in which the primary antibody was produced. The enzyme substrate, 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) is then converted by HRP to a precipitating brown end-product. 9 . Light microscope. 10. Incubator 37 \u2022 C.",
