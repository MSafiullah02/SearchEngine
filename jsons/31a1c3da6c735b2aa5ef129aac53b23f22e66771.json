Methods Authors collected regional recommendations to re-organize the healthcare system during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020. The specific protocols implemented in an orthopaedic hospital, selected as a regional hub for minor trauma, are analyzed and described in this article. Results Two referral centres were identified as the hubs for minor trauma to reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals. These two centres have specific features: an emergency room, specialized orthopaedic surgeons for joint diseases and trauma surgeons on-call 24/7. Patients with trauma without the need for a multi-disciplinary approach or needing non-deferrable elective orthopaedic surgery were moved to these hospitals. Authors report the internal protocols of one of these centres. All elective surgery was stopped, outpatient clinics limited to emergencies and specific pathways, ward and operating theatre dedicated to COVID-19-positive patients were implemented. An oropharyngeal swab was performed in the emergency room for all patients needing to be admitted, and patients were moved to a specific ward with single rooms to wait for the results. Specific courses were organized to demonstrate the correct use of personal protection equipment (PPE). Conclusion The structure of the orthopaedic hubs, and the internal protocols proposed, could help to improve the quality of assistance for patients with musculoskeletal disorders and reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The Coronavirus, COVID-19, is affecting 167 countries around the world, most notably in the USA, Italy, China, Iran and Spain [2, 4] . As of 20 March 2020, Italy was the world's centre of active Coronavirus cases and more than half of these cases were diagnosed in Lombardy, a region inhabited by 10 million people in the north of Italy, with 22,264 positive patients and 2,549 deaths in less than 4 weeks (21 February-20 March 2020), 1,050 patients are admitted into intensive care units and 8,785 patients in internal medicine wards on 20 March 2020 [1] . The regional healthcare system had to quickly change its organization to meet the needs of positive patients, considering their frequent hospitalizations (8,785 people, 39.4% of symptomatic patients) and admittance to intensive care units (ICU) (1,050 people, 4.7% of symptomatic patients) [1] . On 8 March 2020 the regional government decided to redirect patients affected by severe acute pathologies to selected centres that could cater to their specific requirements. These hospitals must guarantee a 24 h service with active medical rounds, with different pathways between COVID-19-positive and -negative patients and should cooperate with surrounding hospitals for patient management. The decision was to admit suspected COVID-19 patients in 15 first-responder hub hospitals, chosen because they either had expertise in infectious disease or were part of the Venous-Venous ECMO Respiratory Failure Network. To make ICU beds and qualified personnel available, nonurgent procedures were cancelled, and over the first 18 days, 482 ICU beds were made available for COVID-19 patients. Several specific hubs were selected for diseases other than COVID-19, like trauma, neurosurgical, neurologic, cardiological and vascular emergencies. Focusing on patients with orthopaedic and trauma emergencies, two different types of hubs were selected; the poly-specialistic big trauma centres and specialistic referral centres for minor trauma or elective orthopaedic surgeries that cannot be postponed.",

This approach led to implementing the hub-and-spoke organizational design, defined as a model which arranges service delivery assets into a network, consisting of an anchor establishment (hub) which offers a full array of services, complemented by secondary establishments (spokes) which offer more limited service arrays, routing patients needing more intensive services to the hub for treatment. Lombardy has routinely six poly-trauma centres, covering about 1,600,000 people each. For the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, the regional decision was to reduce them to three poly-trauma hubs and to modulate the network accordingly.",

All minor trauma without the need for a multi-disciplinary approach and requiring surgical treatment was considered appropriate for moving into one of these two hospitals. Different considerations were made for non-postponable elective orthopaedic surgery. An expert meeting was organized among orthopaedic specialists in the referral centres to define a list including all the pathologies that could be considered as emergencies. This list included generic descriptions of the pathologies, not limited to specific joints, to permit a broad interpretation of the particular emergency in question. The list was delivered to all the hospitals of the Lombardy region, and the English translation of the final version is reported in Table 1 . Patient transfer was possible after phone contact with the specialist of the hub centre, and after completing a checklist to evaluate clinical aspects such as fever, flu-like or respiratory symptoms, swabs and medical history.",

This orthopaedic centre is the oldest orthopaedic institute in Italy, founded in 1874, and its activity is focused on musculoskeletal diseases, covering all aspects of orthopaedics and trauma. The hospital has an emergency service open 24 h every day, and a trauma surgeon on-call for emergencies. The emergency service treats about 35,000 patients every year, with more than 2,000 hospitalizations. The hospital has 12 operating theatres working on weekdays, with about 7,400 surgical cases performed every year, of which about 30% are fractures. Public outpatient service is active all weekdays for first consultations, and post-operative controls, as well as a private outpatient clinic, are active all working days in the same building.",

This team consisted of the general manager of the hospital, the chief of anaesthesiology, the chief of the orthopaedic department, the scientific director, hospital medical director, risk manager, head of the nursing team and the communication manager. A daily meeting was organized by the team to monitor the evolution of COVID-19, implement regional recommendations and take decisions regarding employers' organization, surgical and outpatient activities, emergency department procedures and management of suspicious Coronavirus infections among patients and workers. The first decision was to rationalize surgical activity, blocking all elective surgery and performing only trauma cases. The rationale of this decision was to avoid a potential overlapping of a Coronavirus infection with the post-operative course so as not to risk a transfer to ICU. This aspect is relevant, considering that two potential risks underlie a transfer in ICU. The first is the potential lack of beds due to the large number of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, exposing the operated patient to a life-threatening risk. The second one is to leave available all potential emergency beds available during the outbreak of a disease that requires ICU in a high percentage of the infected.",

Measures were also taken to raise awareness among staff regarding correct PPE use to avoid the reduction of the available stock. Regional guidelines regarding the use of PPE were shared by the hospital educational office both with residential and online-learning courses implemented to be more effective. The residential courses had to be structured in large meeting rooms, with all the attendees using a protection surgical mask and with a limited number of participants.

The period which represents the highest risk of exposure involved direct contact with respiratory droplets during airway management, primarily during intubation and extubation. For this reason, a specific protection kit was implemented in this procedure and all intubations were performed using a video laryngoscope to keep the head of the anaesthesiologist away from the patient's mouth and to allow a faster procedure. Furthermore, inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE), improper use of PPE and poor hand hygiene were potential factors that can lead to virus transmission. Where possible, local or spinal anesthesia was preferred in COVID-19 patients to reduce the risk of overlapping pneumonia secondary to an invasive procedure. The anaesthesiologist and the dedicated nurse should dress in a filter room with an FPP2 mask, a protective disposable gown that includes the neck and head, protective glasses and disposable protection for the shoes. Healthcare professionals not involved in the procedure had to wait outside the operating room to reduce the risk of contamination. The surgeon and surgical nurse dressed in the new isolated changing room. After a social (routine) hand wash, second-skin gloves were used, and not removed until the final PPE removal at the end of all the procedures. Surgical dressings included a protective disposable gown that included the neck and head, protective glasses and disposable protection for the shoes. PPE had to be applied correctly in the proper order before entry into the patient care area and should not be modified while in the patient care area. Removing used PPE is a high-risk process that required a structured procedure, a trained observer, an assistant and a designated area for removal to ensure protection. PPE had to be removed slowly in the correct sequence to reduce the possibility of self-contamination or other exposure to the virus.",
