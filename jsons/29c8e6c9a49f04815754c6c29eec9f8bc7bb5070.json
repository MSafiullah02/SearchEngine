A novel type of human coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified to be the etiologic agent of SARS (1) (2) (3) . The coronaviruses belong to a diverse family of large, enveloped, single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of animal host cells (4 ) . There are three groups of coronaviruses; mammalian viruses are found in groups 1 and 2, and avian viruses are found only in group 3 (4 ) . In the past, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) found in both group 1 (HCoV-229E) and group 2 (HCoV-OC43) were associated only with mild upper respiratory tract diseases (5 ) , whereas the novel SARS-CoV appears to be the first human coronavirus responsible for severe disease in humans. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that SARS-CoV does not belong to any of the above three groups, which contain all other known coronaviruses, including the human coronaviruses; this suggests that SARS-CoV did not arise by recombination or mutation of the known coronaviruses (6, 7 ) . SARS-CoV contains a RNA genome of \u03f330 kb. Its overall genome organization is typical of other coronaviruses, with five major open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the replicase polyprotein, which comprises two-thirds of the genome, and the four major structural proteins. The nucleocapsid (N) protein and the membrane (M) protein interact to form a spherical core, whereas the spike (S) glycoprotein, and the envelope (E) protein constitute the viral envelope (6 -8 ) .

The potential receptor-binding site of SARS-CoV should lie within the surface region of S protein, and it would be a good target for the development of synthetic peptide-based vaccines against SARS-CoV. To date, there is no specific treatment for SARS, and the control of SARS-CoV infection by vaccination is not yet available. It is possible for SARS to recur in a seasonal pattern similar to other similar respiratory diseases; thus the development of an effective vaccine is necessary for sustained control of SARS. Although both attenuated and inactivated coronaviruses could be used for vaccine development, these types of SARS vaccines bear a potential risk of unpredictable SARS outbreak. In this study, we focused on the use of biologically active synthetic peptides for viral protein neutralization, which aimed to block the viral invasion by eliciting an immune response that could specifically recognize and neutralize the S protein of SARS-CoV.
