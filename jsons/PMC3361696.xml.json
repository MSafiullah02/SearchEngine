            "text": "Since it was first invented in the late 1970s, DNA sequencing has been one of the most influential innovations in biological research.16, 17, 18 This rapidly evolving technique has provided a feasible approach to a multitude of problems concerning biology, including infectious disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most common method for amplifying nucleotide sequences based on defined primer sets that recognize specific regions of the DNA of a sample. Physicians routinely refer to data from PCR and sequencing methods as an integral part of the standard of care. For example, HIV medications are chosen after analyzing the virus genotype for the presence of mutations that would confer resistance to some of the antiretroviral drugs on the market, and viral loads (viral levels measured by PCR) are used to help predict the responses to therapy.19 Similar approaches are also being used for other viral diseases such as hepatitis B virus,20, 21, 22 hepatitis C (HCV) virus,23, 24, 25, 26 and influenza.27, 28, 29 PCR and sequencing techniques also play a crucial role in pathogen discovery and outbreak investigation. In the recent years, the importance of this field has been highlighted by the growing number of emerging pathogens and their rapid spread as a consequence of globally mobile populations, climatic changes, improved surveillance and threats of bioterrorism. Both basic research and clinical microbiology laboratories use uniplex and multiplex PCR assays for the rapid identification and typing of many bacterial and viral pathogens. Conventional uniplex PCR methods use specifically targeted sets of primers (1 set per reaction) to amplify conserved genetic regions of a sample and identify close variants of known pathogens. Multiplex PCR assays, which first emerged in the late 1990s,30 are based on the same theory but can amplify multiple regions of DNA at once from a single sample, thus producing additional information that would otherwise require several times the amount of reagents to run using uniplex PCR.31 Although multiplex PCR techniques were a significant improvement compared with conventional PCR, both approaches are still limited in their ability to detect new pathogens and to screen large numbers of sequences in an efficient manner.",

            "text": "The introduction of microarray technology in the middle to late 1990s allowed for the development of microarray-based pathogen detection platforms and high-density, pan-microbial arrays, which truly made rapid screening for a large number of pathogens feasible.32 In this application of microarray technology, sample material suspected to contain pathogen genomes is hybridized to a 2-dimensional (2-D) array (or gene chip) of hundreds or thousands of miniaturized spots containing nucleic acid probes specific for various pathogen sequences. Microarray-based pathogen-detection platforms, such as the GreeneChip and the Virochip,33, 34, 35, 36 use 70-mer oligonucleotide probes of conserved genetic regions within each taxonomic group of viruses. Because of their length, these probes are more tolerant of sequence mismatches and therefore allow for the detection of unknown microbial targets.37 Furthermore, the probes are updated continuously when new viruses and sequences are added to their associated databases. To identify a pathogen from a clinical specimen, nucleic acids are amplified randomly and then hybridized to the chips. Given the large number of probes and possible hybridization successes, the results are analyzed with the help of computer programs that use algorithms and statistics to identify virus hybridization patterns. Although microarray-based pathogen-detection platforms have been instrumental in the detection of numerous pathogens, including novel ones like the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV),34, 38 they still rely on some prior knowledge of relevant genome sequences.39, 40, 41 The introduction of high-throughput sequencing has revolutionized the ability to detect novel infectious agents whose genomic sequences are completely unknown or are present in extremely low numbers. The high-throughput sequencing revolution started in 1987 with the introduction of the first automatic sequencer.42 The first of the next-generation sequencing technologies was developed only a few years later,43 but it took nearly 15 years of technologic improvements before it became commercially available.44, 45 Currently, the most frequently used platforms of this type include the 454 large-scale parallel pyrosequencing system (454 Life Sciences/Roche, Branford, Conn) and the Solexa (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, Calif) sequencing-by-synthesis system, but this field is evolving rapidly with new platform generations regularly being developed. These techniques allow for the \u201cdeep\u201d sequencing of clinical samples. The term \u201cdeep\u201d refers to the depth of coverage or the average number of times that a single nucleotide is sequenced, and it allows for high levels of accuracy in sequence determination.46, 47, 48 \u201cDeep\u201d sequencing methods can, therefore, achieve thousands to millions of simultaneous sequence reads per run, allowing for the precise determination of the entire genome of an organism. \u201cUltra-deep\u201d sequencing, which is largely being enabled by platforms such as the 454 sequencing system, provides an even deeper sequence coverage and allows for several additional applications, including amplicon and transcript sequencing, which can detect extremely low-abundance genetic variations.49 Because pyrosequencing techniques are based on the detection of light produced whenever a nucleotide is incorporated and do not rely on physical separation of DNA bases, these platforms can be run in parallel and miniaturized to any reaction volume that generates detectable levels of light, thus driving down the overall cost of sequencing. Nevertheless, the shorter reads necessitated by the deeper sequencing capacity of next-generation sequencing creates additional challenges for sequence assembly and gene annotation.49 Although the cost of sequencing is decreasing, the analysis of the accumulated data is costly, time consuming, and computationally challenging. The analysis is complicated by the fact that computer systems will have to discriminate between the nucleic acids of the host and those of the newly discovered infectious agent. Despite these challenges, several new viruses have been identified using \u201cdeep\u201d sequencing systems.50, 51, 52, 53 Additionally, these systems have made subsequent steps in pathogen discovery, including sequencing the entire genome to facilitate the development of diagnostic techniques and the identification of potential therapeutic targets, more time and cost effective.",

As a result, techniques such as reverse vaccinology have emerged that allow for the design of more specifically targeted vaccines.58 The power of reverse vaccinology lies in its ability to identify novel vaccine targets based on computer-facilitated predictions of the immunogenicity and prevalence of all antigens in a given pathogen without ever having to cultivate the specific microorganism. Once potentially suitable vaccine targets are identified, each gene from the infectious agent that encodes one of these targets is cloned into an expression vector, and the resulting proteins are expressed in vitro and used to immunize an animal model from which antisera will be derived. Each corresponding antisera is then tested for its ability to neutralize or protect against the original infectious agent. Using this information, vaccines can be designed to elicit specific immune responses against the specified target and are combined with rationally designed adjuvants whose mechanisms of action could improve vaccine immunogenicity. One example of the successful use of this process is the recently developed vaccine for serogroup B Neisseria meningitides.\n59, 60, 61 An array of other potential vaccines, including those targeting group B Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae species, are currently under study.62\n",

This technique has very important implications for vaccine production because it means that very specific changes can be reverse engineered into the sequences of the plasmid DNA used for co-transfection, allowing extremely fine control over the pathogenicity and immunogenicity of the resulting virus.63 Reverse genetics has been used successfully in the development of promising candidates for vaccines targeting influenza viruses. Several groups have explored reverse genetics strategies to design live-attenuated H5N1 influenza virus vaccines,64 and a recent phase I clinical trial has demonstrated the safety and immunogenicity of a reverse genetics-derived NS1-truncated variant of an H1N1 influenza virus in male volunteers.65 Reverse genetics has also been used in pathogenetic studies. In this case, the insertion, mutagenesis, or deletion of specific sequences in the plasmids before transfection can clarify the effect of such modifications on viral infectivity and can help to elucidate the function of any modified protein in the context of the viral life cycle.66 Finally, the ability to exert such exquisite control over a viral sequence would permit the identification of specific sequence alterations that promote viral attenuation, which is information that can be used for the design and generation of new vaccines.67, 68, 69, 70, 71\n",

Because proteins are the major effectors of cellular pathways, proteomics provides a way to interpret information encoded within the genome of an organism.

            "text": "Gel-free proteomic approaches were made possible by coupling the physical separation capabilities of chromatographic techniques to the mass analysis capabilities of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).79, 80 Chromatography is a technique that involves moving the components to be separated (mobile phase) across an immobile support (stationary phase) such that the migration rates of solutes (ie, proteins) vary depending on their chemical properties.83 Liquid chromatography (LC), in which the mobile phase is liquid, is one of the most widely used protein separation techniques in proteomics.83 With the use of smaller particles (less than 2 \u03bcm), monolithic columns (using porous channels rather than beads) and extremely high pressures (up to 19,000 p.s.i.), high-performance LC (HPLC) and ultrahigh-performance LC have improved the efficiency and resolution of protein separation drastically.84 In HPLC, complex protein mixtures are digested by trypsin into their peptide components, which are then moved in a liquid mobile phase at high pressures across a stationary phase that allows for their separation based on polarity. Next, the sorted peptide components are analyzed by MS/MS. The first mass spectrometer is programmed to detect peptides over a range of predetermined masses to distinguish targets of interest from the vast array of proteins typically present in complex biological fluids. The resulting MS1 data are used to pinpoint ions of interest, which are then fragmented, measured, and recorded by the second mass spectrometer (MS2 data). Finally, computer algorithms are used to aid researchers in identifying individual proteins from combined MS1 and MS2 data.77, 79, 81, 85 As an example, the SEQUEST algorithm, developed in 1994, uses the fragmentation spectra of peptides to infer amino acid sequences and match them to translated genomic sequences. This approach has an identification rate of greater than 100 proteins per run.86 The newest iteration of this software, MacroSEQUEST, features enhanced capabilities (eg, posttranslational modification scanning) and a dramatic improvement in processing speed compared with the original version.87\n",

Although shotgun proteomics represents a significant technological advancement in the analysis of complex biological mixtures, the concentrations of individual proteins within such samples can be low enough to require levels of sensitivity beyond what even standard HPLC conditions can achieve. By decreasing flow rates and column diameters, this level of sensitivity can be obtained, but only by adapting the system to the special requirements of nanoliter flow rates (20\u20131000 nL/min).88 Another shortcoming of shotgun proteomics is the inability of one-dimensional HPLC to provide sufficient separating power to manage the vast complexity of proteins inherent in most biological specimens. To address this issue, multidimensional separating approaches, such as multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPit), which combines strong cation exchange chromatography with HPLC, were developed.79, 85 Even with such improvements, these advanced shotgun proteomics platforms can still identify only approximately 40% to 70% of the proteins predicted by a microbial genome (less for proteomes of higher complexity). Furthermore, the actual proteome size may be smaller or larger than predicted by the genome because of the absence of transcription of some proteins and the alternative splicing and/or posttranslational modification of others.77, 81 Therefore, whereas shotgun proteomics does enable the identification and relative abundance of a large number of proteins in a sample, it is not optimal for absolute protein quantitation.",

            "text": "In addition to identifying proteins within complex biological mixture, the need to quantitate these components can provide information regarding their dynamics within the context of a biological system. This added focus has led to the emergence of a derivative field known as quantitative proteomics. Protein quantitation can be relative or absolute. Relative protein abundance may be estimated by several methods, including by measuring the total number of repeat observations of MS/MS spectra from all peptides in a protein (spectral counting), calculating the percentage of possible peptides per protein observed (peptide counting), or by comparing directly the extracted ion chromatograms (XIC, aligned using both mass and elution time) of one sample with that of another sample.90, 91 These label-free techniques have been facilitated greatly by the development of new software programs, such as MZmine, MapQuant, and SuperHirn.91, 92, 93 Alternatively, protein quantification may be accomplished by combining shotgun proteomic techniques with stable isotope labeling.90, 91 Using this approach, samples are labeled differentially with stable isotopes (heavy vs light), then pooled and analyzed together. Peptides common to both samples, but labeled with different isotopes, behave the same on analysis and are detected as peak pairs. By comparing the sizes of these peaks, the relative abundance of the peptides in each sample can be compared.79 The methods for absolute quantitation of protein abundance are more desirable in many cases (eg, for determining copies per cell). One technology that addresses this need and is now commonplace in clinical settings is called multiple reaction monitoring, also known as selective reaction monitoring (MRM/SRM). This technique exploits the unique capabilities triple quadrupole (QQQ) MS to analyze precursor and fragment ion pairs. QQQ MS uses 3 sets of 4 circular metal rods (quadrupoles) that run parallel to each other. The first quadrupole (Q1) acts specifically to select peptide ions with predefined m/z values. These peptides are then fragmented by the second quadrupole (Q2), which serves as a collision cell. The third quadrupole (Q3) can be set either to scan the entire m/z range to provide information about the structure of the original ion or to filter out fragments with specific m/z values that may be indicative of particular characteristics (eg, functional groups). MRM/SRM can provide targeted information (sensitive to the attomole level) about multiple peptides across a wide concentration scale within a single sample.90, 94, 95 The sensitivity of the MRM/SRM technique can also be improved by enriching the target from a complex background using antibody-mediated approaches such as stable isotype capture by antipeptide antibodies and immuno-matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization.90 As with relative protein quantitation, absolute protein quantitation possesses its own arsenal of computer programs designed to assist in the analysis of MRM/SRM data, including Skyline MRM/SRM builder, MRMpilot (Applied Biosystems), Peptide Optimizer, and Dynamic MRM software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif), MaRiMba, MRMaid, and MRMer.90\n",

Moreover, metabolites represent the level at which most pharmaceuticals exert their effects.

The typical workflow involves mechanical extraction coupled to a rapid cooling step that halts metabolism in its native state, followed by detection (either via NMR or MS) and data analysis. MS-based metabolomics requires the additional separation of components by either gas chromatography or LC for enhanced molecular identification. For each molecule within a sample of interest, LC-MS-based metabolomics generates 3 pieces of data: (1) chromatographic retention time, which informs on the chemical structure; (2) a m/z ratio, which informs on the molecular mass; and (3) abundance. The retention time and m/z ratio may then be queried against a library of known standards to determine the identity of each metabolite.106 An NMR-based metabolomic analysis, by contrast, provides a nondestructive way to view changes in metabolite levels either in vitro or in vivo more broadly. Moreover, it provides more detailed structural information than MS. Because MS analysis provides better resolution and sensitivity, it remains the predominant methodology for analyzing metabolic data. All metabolomic analyses result in complex, multivariable data sets that require visualization software for spectral analysis as well as bioinformatics and statistical methodologies for interpretation.104, 107\n",

Steady-state metabolite profiling may be global (profiling of all small molecule metabolites within a sample) or targeted (analysis of only prespecified metabolites of interest), and it has been used to discover new biomarkers, inform on dysregulated pathways associated with disease, and generate information about cellular functions. Labeled flux analysis, in which radiolabeled isotopes are used to analyze changes in the amount of a given metabolite that is used and produced in a particular metabolic pathway, is an approach that yields more detailed information about the dynamic nature of biological pathways and can be used to better identify potential therapeutic targets.107 Recently, Henderson et al108 used a steady-state LC-MS-based metabolomics approach to identify how bacterial strains associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) differed from those that colonize the gastrointestinal tract. Their results indicated that urinary Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains preferentially express 2 small molecules, yersiniabactin and salmochelin, which are known to be important in iron scavenging and support bacterial survival and growth. These findings suggest that new antibiotics directed against yersiniabactin- or salmochelin-producing E. coli strains might be an improved and more targeted strategy to prevent recurrent UTIs. In another example, Munger et al109 used changes in metabolic flux between uninfected and human cytomegalovirus-infected cells to identify pathways that were upregulated by viral infection, thus providing important information regarding potential targets for novel antivirals aimed at blocking viral replication.",

They also play important roles in host\u2013pathogen interactions and immunomodulation.111, 113 Glycomics is the comprehensive study of all sugars in an organism.114, 115 Because cellular sugars can be simple sugars, glycoproteins, or glycolipids, there is no common experimental approach for their analysis. Instead, glycomic studies use a combination of the techniques found in meta bolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics.110 Glycoconjugates participate in a variety of biological processes associated with cell adhesion and migration, bacterial and viral recognition, signaling pathways, and innate immunity.115 Therefore, the study of changes in the lipid and sugar components of a biological system can provide powerful clues about disease-related mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets. Indeed, these approaches have shown particular promise in the study of infectious disease. Lipidomics has been used to uncover the mechanisms involved in enhancing the drug susceptibility of Candida albicans\n116 to gain insight regarding the intracellular processes and lipid composition of HIV,117, 118 CMV,119 and HCV,120, 121 and to identify lipidomic modifications that occur in the host as a result of bacterial or viral infection.122 The utility of glycomics has also been demonstrated recently in the characterization of specific interactions between viral proteins and various forms of sialic acid,123, 124 the detailed analysis of how lipopolysaccharide from Coxiella burnetii may contribute to pathogenesis,125 and the discovery that the glycan coats of HIV-1 virions match that of the T cell immunomodulatory microvesicles from which they derive, suggesting a mechanism by which the virus can evade the antiviral immune response.126\n",

Moving forward, improvements in automated metabolite identification will expand exponentially the potential uses of metabolomics-based approaches.

This convention arose, in part, because the suffixes \u201come\u201d and \u201comics\u201d succinctly describe a holistic way of looking at relationships that exist within a relatively complex scientific domain; however, this trend also reflects the growing involvement of bioinformatics and the internet as a way to integrate complex biological data.127 Concurrent to the significant advances in \u201comics\u201d sciences that have allowed for a better understanding of the molecular and cellular processes that occur within humans, researchers also began to appreciate the number and complexity of organisms that resided on and in the human body. After the publication of the human genome sequence in 2001,128, 129 scientists began to call for a \u201csecond human genome project\u201d that would catalog the complete inventory of microbial genomes at major sites of colonization on the human body.130, 131 Because microbiota are believed to play a fundamentally important role in human health and disease,132 a microbial inventory in combination with a comprehensive analysis of host gene expression would provide insights into the mechanisms of this interaction. A landmark study that was published in 2005 by Eckburg et al133 used the 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing technique to characterize the endogenous gastrointestinal microbial flora in 3 individuals. The authors concluded that the bacterial communities varied tremendously from one individual to the next. This and other studies that came after indicated that a larger scale investigation of the human microbial ecosystem was warranted. Thus, the NIH initiated a 5-year project called the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) in 2007.134\n",

There is also a growing interest regarding the effects of the gut microbiome on the development of the immune system. A recent study showed that mice treated with antibiotics that depleted specific gut bacterial populations would have an impairment of virus-specific cell-mediated and humoral responses in the lung after infection with influenza virus.141 These data will require confirmation and more in-depth studies that address mechanism; however, they raise a series of new questions about the role of the bacterial microbiota in human health. Not only has the HMP made major advances in our understanding of the human microbiome, but also it has contributed significantly to the growing field of metagenomics by developing broadly applicable techniques for analyzing massive amounts of sequence data. For example, Langmead et al142 designed a cloud-computing software tool called Crossbow that can analyze large DNA sequence data sets more rapidly (38-fold coverage of the human genome in 3 h) to perform the alignment and detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) without sacrificing accuracy. Another group developed a robust software program called QIIME (pronounced \u201cchime\u201d and stands for quantitative insights into microbial ecology) that can analyze pyrosequencing data from thousands of heterogeneous experimental data sets in order to acquire information rapidly about various microbial communities.143\n",

Therefore, although not as well-defined as the HMP, at least 2 other infectious disease-related \u201comes\u201d have emerged in parallel: the human virome and the human mycobiome, which comprise the myriad of viruses and fungi, respectively, that inhabit the human biosphere and play roles in health and disease (Fig 2). In 2003, Anderson et al36 proposed a system for the global screening of viruses in large human populations. Although this global screening is not limited to viruses that persist chronically in the human body as is the case for the commensal bacteria populations included in the HMP, such a system could lay the groundwork for the rapid detection of outbreaks and the systematic discovery of novel human viruses, as well as provide better clues about etiologies in human disease. For example, 1 study investigating the human virome uncovered differences in the metabolic states of DNA viromes in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis (CF) compared with non-CF patients.145 Another group demonstrated that bacteriophage populations became more similar in the guts of individuals who were on a diet of similar fat content, thus raising the possibility that virus populations could be engineered to combat obesity.146 In contrast, studies regarding the human mycobiome seem to still be in their infancy as the first study describing a baseline mycobiome in humans was published only recently.147 In this study, the authors used multitag pyrosequencing to characterize the fungi present in the oral cavity of healthy individuals and identified differences and similarities in white and Asian populations.",

The Systems Virology Center will focus on creating a unified view of the mechanisms of pathogenesis for highly pathogenic respiratory viruses including the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, the H5N1 avian influenza virus, and SARS-CoV.151, 155 In contrast, the Center for Systems Influenza will focus more specifically on defining host innate immune responses to infection with influenza virus strains of varying pathogenicities, as well as characterizing regulatory networks associated with concurrent secondary infections like S. aureus.\n151, 156 To date, several specific achievements have come out of these centers. Using a technique called weighted gene correlation network analysis, in which relationships between genes that are coexpressed are weighted based on their strengths or capacities,157 the transcriptional response of human bronchial epithelial cells infected with a highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus was profiled and compared with cells infected with a less virulent strain to identify potential novel mediators of pathogenesis.158 Another group performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis using LC-MS/MS to identify a large number of human host proteins associated with the polymerase complex of an H5N1 influenza virus. In addition to previously published interactions, this method identified novel interactions of the viral polymerase with host mitochondrial, apoptosis-inducing, innate antiviral, and RNA polymerase accessory proteins that could provide new insight into mechanisms by which the viral polymerase may contribute to host cell pathogenicity.159 Additionally, this center has used next-generation sequencing and analysis of the host transcriptome in response to influenza virus and SARS-CoV infections to investigate beyond the proteome and characterize the roles of non\u2013protein-coding RNAs in regulating the host innate immune response.160\n",

For example, computer simulations of the molecular dynamics of association, dissociation and posttranslational modifications of large peptide folding processes are used frequently in the field of systems immunology to characterize receptor\u2013ligand interactions that occur between the host and pathogen. One study used this technique and the model system of EBV to demonstrate that some T cell receptor structures appear more frequently than others because of certain pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-like traits that occur within the T cell repertoire.168 Another group used constant pH molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanism behind the ligand-binding activity of an innate immune system PRR that recognizes a pH-sensitive microbial protein to understand more completely how this type of interaction plays a role in immune surveillance and clearance of apoptotic cells.169 In addition to simulations that model the dynamics of molecular-level interactions, several programs have emerged that combine the techniques of systems biology with information provided by data-driven prediction methods. Because of advances in the predictive capacity of systems biology research, the newest version of the computer simulation software, C-ImmSim, can model the immune response in silico more accurately. Recently, the creators of C-ImmSim demonstrated a variety of new applications now accessible by their improved program, including the modeling of primary and secondary responses to prime/boost immunization, the way in which immunodominant peptides lead to affinity maturation and the relationship of diversity in MHC to \u201ctime to AIDS\u201d in HIV-infected patients.170 Another simulation framework that has made its way into the public domain is the Multiscale Systems Immunology platform, which aims to model the early immune response to vaccination and natural infection by incorporating realistic biophysics and intracellular dynamics.171\n",

With the advent of systems vaccinology, scientists examined comprehensively the initial molecular signatures in individuals vaccinated against YFV not only to elucidate the mechanisms behind the vaccine\u2019s efficacy but also to establish predictive correlates for the later development of protective responses.172, 173 Systems vaccinology was also used to establish the predictive correlates of a protective antibody response after administration of the trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine,174 and similar approaches have been applied to the study of immune responses to Brucella melitensis and fungal infections.175, 176, 177 Ideally, subsequent development of these models will define inherent and infection-mediated perturbations in the genetic regulatory networks of the host and will enable predictions about how the host will respond to vaccines.

            "text": "Once the correlates of vaccine-induced protective immune responses against infection are well defined with the help of systems vaccinology, new methodologies must be identified that can apply this information to the design and development of new vaccines. The likeliness that commonalities exist among many different vaccines regarding the correlates of successful immune responses will drive faster and more accurate ways of screening vaccine candidates for their effectiveness. For example, Pulendran et al179 predicted the development of a vaccine chip microarray, similar to the MammaPrint prognostic chip that was developed for breast cancer, which will be able to predict the immunogenicity of any vaccine. Although this specific technology may so far still exist only in theory, several systems biology approaches are being used currently to aid with antigen discovery and vaccine development. Phage display is one such technique that enables the screening and identification of unique molecules with highly specific affinities for targets of interest.180 This approach works by introducing a foreign sequence at an appropriate site within a bacteriophage coat protein gene that results in the display of that protein on the phage surface. If random sequences are inserted, then it is possible to obtain a library containing a large number of distinct proteins, each displayed on a different phage. By immobilizing a DNA or protein target to a solid surface, libraries can be \u201cpanned\u201d for phages that recognize the target. After washing, phages that do not bind to the target will be washed away, whereas specific phages can be eluted and used to produce more phage, thus enriching the population for relevant binding phages and enabling the isolation of specific proteins of interest for use in subsequent applications.181 Phage display is a powerful technique because of its many applications for vaccine and drug development. One application of phage display technology is the identification of the epitope repertoire of antibodies in postvaccination human sera. To this end, Khurana et al182 used H5N1 influenza virus whole genome-fragment phage display libraries to evaluate the quality of antibody responses in humans after immunization with a novel virus-like particle vaccine. This approach also enabled the authors to determine the most appropriate dosage of the vaccine to induce the desired antibody repertoire and will help them to evaluate the usefulness of incorporating an adjuvant into the vaccine.",

Besides its usefulness in evaluating the efficacy of vaccine-induced immune responses, phage display can also be used to identify and synthesize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can be used for therapeutic purposes in a variety of infections. An additional benefit of antibody identification through phage display is that because phage libraries can be generated from any set of sequences, it is possible to display human antibody fragments, thus avoiding the side effects inherent in humanized or chimeric antibodies.183 This approach has produced several mAbs with potential therapeutic applications against agents of infectious disease, including influenza A virus,184\nClostridium difficile, HIV, viral hepatitis, rabies, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis).\n185 Of these, the mAb targeting the protective antigen of B. anthracis, raxibacumab, is so far the only one that has met all criteria for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).186\n",

Combinatorial chemistry and diversity-oriented synthesis are 2 of the most important new methodologies in drug discovery because they have drastically reduced the time and costs associated with producing effective, marketable, and competitive new drugs. The power of these techniques comes from the ability to synthesize extremely large libraries of high-quality compounds with complex molecular diversity that increases their likelihood of interacting with biological macromolecules in a selective manner with high affinity.187 Phage display libraries have also been used widely in screening for novel drug candidates based on specific protein\u2013protein interactions. Although they are frequently cheaper than most chemical synthesis methodologies, there are still several limitations regarding stop codon placement within displayed sequences, inefficient transformation methods, peptide length, and restricted use of naturally occurring amino acids. Nevertheless, several proof-of-principle studies have been performed recently to overcome these limitations, including 1 study that demonstrated that the incorporation of genetically encoded unusual amino acids might be feasible.188\n",

Although many different assays are used in high-throughput screening, the general principle is that the specific molecular target or pathway of interest is combined systematically with each possible drug compound, then verified in manual or automated platforms for a positive result, or \u201chit.\u201d The resulting \u201chits\u201d would then be selected based on how strongly they interacted with the target, and additional confirmatory experiments would be performed to characterize the interaction.189 The incorporation of automation, computational methods, and nanotechnology has allowed for enormously increased efficiency in both the development of combinatorial libraries and the high-throughput screening of potentially useful drugs. To illustrate the rapidly accelerating success of this method, a recent paper has reported achieving ultrahigh-throughput screening speeds of 100 million individual enzyme reactions in 10 h using only small reagent volumes; this represents a 1000-fold increase in speed and a 1 million-fold reduction in cost compared with standard high-throughput techniques.190 A negative consequence of the massive amounts of data generated from high- and ultrahigh-throughput technologies is that bottlenecks will occur at the level of drug development and optimization. In the past decade, more than 3000 expressed proteins have been described as potential drug targets, yet only 20% of those have been exploited commercially.191 Therefore, despite the optimism engendered by high-throughput screening and other advances in drug discovery and validation, numerous obstacles remain for the translation of this vast amount of data into clinical application.",

The resulting principle is that if the manifestation of disease is influenced by interactions between the host and the infectious agent, then characterizing the host genetic correlates to disease would help to predict individual susceptibility to specific infection-related pathologies. The recent technological advances in sequencing and computational biology have facilitated the identification of host factors that predispose or affect the response to disease. Therefore, therapies can now be tailored according to the genetic makeup of the host and the characteristics of the microbe responsible for disease. Francis Collins suggested that genetics could be integrated with medicine either by using classic or \u201cold\u201d genetics to develop genetic tests for monogenic diseases and prenatal diagnostics or by using \u201cnew\u201d genetics to predict patient responses and implement personalized medicine.192 The clinical application of personalized medicine principles may have seemed almost visionary a few years ago, but now this approach is used routinely in the treatment of some diseases. For example, genomic data are used to make accurate predictions about the susceptibility of a patient to disease or about how he/she will respond to treatment. Specifically, the application of personalized medicine is common in diseases such as cancer caused by some solid tumors or hematologic malignancies where patients are genetically tested to determine their likelihood of responding to therapy or having a serious adverse reaction to various drugs.193, 194\n",

In this case, patterns of gene expression in human cells, most frequently peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), are studied by hybridizing biological material to defined gene chips.209, 210, 211 With regard to infectious disease, microarray technology has made a huge contribution to our understanding of the changes evident in the transcriptome of humans during infection. Lempicki et al212 used microarray-derived gene expression patterns to demonstrate that the increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes in patient PBMCs could be one explanation for why anti-HCV therapy in patients coinfected with HCV and HIV has lower success rates. In another study, Jacobsen et al213 used microarray technology to identify the biomarkers expressed during infection with M. tuberculosis that would allow for more accurate predictions regarding the outcome of infection. Thus, microarray technology has been broadly applicable in studies aimed at characterizing the infection profiles of a variety of microorganisms, including SARS-COV,214 dengue,215 influenza,216\nS. aureus,\n217 and S. enterica.\n218 The advent of next-generation deep and ultra-deep sequencing techniques has also improved the ability of researchers to identify splice variants and low abundance transcriptomic changes in response to infectious disease.49 Data such as these can be used to inform improvements in the diagnosis and prognosis of disease, the design of antiviral and antibiotic therapies, and the construction of vaccines that can target susceptible populations more specifically.",

One example is the reaction to abacavir, which is a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor. The major toxicity manifests as a hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in approximately 5% to 8% of recipients within 6 weeks of commencing therapy.219 Mallal et al220 showed that patients carrying the HLA-B5701 allele are more likely to experience this hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir. This marker had a negative predictive value of 100%, indicating that genetic tests can provide unequivocal information that can help to predict and prevent otherwise unpredictable drug reactions. Another example of the use of pharmacogenomics to guide therapy is in the case of the antiretroviral drug maraviroc, which is a CCR5-specific HIV entry inhibitor. This drug is effective only in patients who are infected with strains of HIV that use the CCR5 coreceptor for entry, but not in patients who are infected with the CCR4-tropic viruses. Therefore, by screening for the specific tropism of the strain of HIV with which the patient is infected, clinicians can target drug therapy more specifically, for example, by using maraviroc only in patients who are infected with the susceptible strain of HIV.221 These results underline the success of GWAS and personalized medicine in predicting which populations should avoid treatment with specific drugs because they are more prone to side effects.",

            "text": "Although the clinical application of \u201comics\u201d and systems biology holds great potential for medical discovery, the introduction of high-throughput technologies has also introduced new questions and challenges regarding the transformation of the large volumes of data produced by these approaches into useful information for the development of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic devices. The \u201clarge n, small p\u201d paradigm, in which the number of study subjects (n) is higher than the variables (p) generated from the study itself, currently serves as a fundamental analytic principle for data modeling. With a shift in this ratio toward smaller n values compared with the large number of variables amassed through high-throughput data acquisition, it is becoming clear that this paradigm will need to be revised to preserve statistical accuracy.222 To address this problem, some researchers have proposed changes in the mathematical principles used for data analysis, such as using continuous variables222, 223, 224 and nonlinear modeling.222, 225, 226 Some also recommend switching from deterministic to probability-based modeling strategies to account for the uncertainty that is typical of common clinical scenarios and to predict the relative probabilities of various outcomes given the same initial situation.222, 227 In addition to the necessary evolution of data modeling strategies, another critical factor in the successful translation of research data is the capability to access and analyze large sets of data that originated from different sources and contain diverse types of information. There is, therefore, a need to develop methods that enable the construction of hybrid data sets that contain both clinical and biological data, and are organized in ways that are accessible to all translational researchers and compatible among different systems. Translation bioinformatics is an emerging area that proposes to offer a holistic approach to this issue by providing integrative methods for incorporating multiple data modalities and enabling the development of predictive models for therapeutic responses.228 Although a detailed description of the methods used for data integration and modeling is beyond the scope of our article, other articles by Yan,228 Kanehisa et al,229 and Sarkar et al230 offer a more complete review of the topic. These developments are still the object of research and far from completion, but as the data accumulate, only the full development of new analytic strategies will enable their full diagnostic and clinical use.",

In the second half of the 1990s, for example, the FDA approved more than 30 NMEs per year.231 By contrast, the number of NMEs approved since 2001 has averaged slightly less than 23 per year, with the exception of 36 approved in 2004, despite the increasing number of potential therapeutic compounds identified from high-throughput technologies.231, 232, 233 In addition to the decline in approvals, the number of NME applications submitted to the FDA over the past decade has decreased, with 2010 producing one of the lowest numbers in more than 15 years.233 Because of this decline in approvals and applications, as well as the increasing use of generic drugs, it is estimated that large cap pharmaceutical companies only can replace, on average, 26 cents to every dollar lost to patent expirations by new product revenues.234 According to current estimates, only 8% of NMEs will make it from candidate selection (in the preclinical stage) to a successful launch.232, 235 This decline in drug development threatens to take not only an economic toll but also a medical one, as approximately 40% of the 2-year increase in life expectancy from 1986 to 2000 was attributable to the introduction of new drugs.236 This lack of new drugs is especially worrisome in the field of infectious disease, where the emergence of multidrug resistant pathogens has led to a situation in which formerly curable infections are now untreatable. Paradoxically, some pharmaceutical companies have indicated that they are curtailing or curbing anti-infective research.10 A major reason for this is that anti-infective agents, which are only needed for a short time in smaller populations, make less economically attractive targets than drugs targeting chronic diseases that appear in the larger aging population (eg, antihypertensives and antidepressants).",

The introduction of specific markers for personalized medicine makes it even more difficult to recruit patients who qualify for these tests. Therefore, many clinical trials take years to complete their enrollment, or they are cancelled because of the inability to recruit a sufficient number of subjects.

Indeed, the average cost to bring an NME to market is now estimated to be $1.8 billion. This estimate seems to be the same regardless of whether the NME is produced by a big pharmaceutical company or small biotechnology firm.232 The NCATs aim to decrease these costs in a number of ways. First, it would encourage the use of early human trials, also called \u201cphase zero\u201d clinical trials, in which \u201cmicrodoses\u201d of a new drug are administered in a small number of patients.237 In these trials, the absorption, tissue distribution, and toxicity of the drug are assessed by highly sensitive methodologies, such as molecular imaging, metabolomics, or proteomics.8 The feasibility of such endeavors has been demonstrated already by the Consortium for Metabonomic Toxicology at the Imperial College in London, which showed it is possible to design a prediction model for clinical toxicity using metabolomic data.104 Another way in which the NCATS would decrease development costs is by encouraging innovative models, including human tissue biobanks, stem cell models, and tissue-engineered organoids. These models would potentially allow researchers to decrease or omit the use of animal models, which have been criticized as both costly and not accurately predictive of efficacy in humans.8, 237 Finally, the NCATS would encourage the development of technologies aimed at biomarker identification. These have been used already by researchers to design a new style of \u201cadaptive\u201d clinical trial, in which the study design changes as new data are collected, allowing patients who are more likely to respond to be assigned to treatment with a given compound.237 Beyond encouraging the development of new technologies aimed at decreasing costs, the NCATS would promote cross-collaborations between academic institutions, biotechnology firms, philanthropic organizations, and pharmaceutical companies to split research and development costs. Last, the proposed Cures Acceleration Network, which will be assessed for congressional funding in the next fiscal year, would provide the NIH with the ability to award up to $15 billion per year to academic and private consortia to direct the development of certain especially promising therapeutics.8\n",

            "text": "Although the need to encourage the development of new drugs and therapeutics is clear, some have expressed concerns that the proposed NCATS represents a change in priority for the NIH away from basic, discovery-based science and toward application-focused research, thus neglecting the fact that basic science lays the foundation for translational research. Indeed, this has been a criticism since the development of the CTSA.245 Another criticism is that the support of GWAS and other high-throughput methodologies causes a dramatic shift from research that is hypothesis based to that which is data driven, placing an overemphasis on screening for drugs and biomarkers at the expense of discovery-based science.246 For example, studies based on high-throughput technologies are typically not the result of experiments designed to test a hypothesis. Rather, they aim to identify systematically all the molecular effectors that are involved in a specific system in the most comprehensive and efficient way possible. To address this critique, some authors have added an extra step of complexity to their high-throughput methods by determining a mechanistic function for the molecules they have identified, switching in this way from \u201cfishing expedition\u201d to discovery-based research. In the end, despite assertions that the establishment of the NCATS will reinforce, rather than detract from basic science, many investigators continue to have concerns, mostly related to money. In today\u2019s climate of funding cuts, some wonder: Will it be possible to receive funding for more basic (ie, less obviously applicable) research? Will the emphasis on collaboration and multidisciplinary approaches shift most of the funding toward multicenter groups of established scientists, making it difficult for new investigators to survive? Will the current emphasis on clinical applicability result in a narrowing of ideas and perspectives that will result in most funding being allocated to well-established scientists pursuing traditional approaches? Beyond these concerns regarding a change in the focus of NIH, concerns regarding policy and infrastructure exist, such as whether funding NCATS programs will take money away from other programs that were previously housed within the NCRR. As the NCRR currently awards funds of approximately $1.25 billion annually, this is a substantial concern.247 Although none of the NCRR programs are currently slated to be discontinued, the perceived lack of transparency surrounding the establishment of the NCATS, the dissolution of the NCRR, and where programs formerly housed within the NCRR will now be located has resulted in persistent scrutiny from both NIH stakeholders and Congress.248, 249, 250\n",

Many criticize the proposed NCATS because they believe it is designed to help companies develop new drugs by decreasing their financial risks, and it is believed that it will do so by using taxpayers\u2019 money. Also, they argue that the NIH only has experience with basic science research and not with drug development. Indeed, some have argued that the decline in research and development productivity is not related to increasing costs, because public investment in the pharmaceutical industry has increased proportionally since 1970, nor is it to the result of time or attritional rates, which have been steady since the 1970s. Instead, they argue that it may be caused by poor prioritization and mismanagement within the pharmaceutical industry.9 Specifically, changes in management techniques in the pharmaceutical industry hierarchy have led to corporate policies that discourage innovation in favor of cost cutting and risk minimization.9, 246 This together with a shift of control from scientists and researchers to marketers, a focus on short-term profits and fast sales growth, and the discontinuation of compounds for nontechnical reasons, have led to the decreased translation of scientific discoveries to clinical applications.9 As such, some have argued that the development of the NCATS might make it even less likely that the pharmaceutical industry will try to solve these problems. Ultimately, although the NCATS might serve as a champion for key therapeutic compounds, the pharmaceutical industry itself will need to reform certain practices if the pace of drug development is to keep up with the pace of translational research.",

With the advent of microarray technology and next-generation sequencing, numerous applications have arisen from the field of genomics, including pathogen discovery, epidemiologic advances, and a variety of molecular techniques that allow for precise manipulation of microbial genomes. As DNA begets RNA and protein, so do the fields of transcriptomics and proteomics follow logically from genomics. Transcriptomics, which is a subset of the field of genomics and concerns the collection of messenger RNA transcripts expressed within an organism, has emerged as a result of more sophisticated techniques that allow for the highly sensitive determination of low-abundance mutations, transcripts, and SNPs. Proteomics is the next major \u201comics\u201d field after genomics, and it focuses on the complement of proteins, their modifications, and their interactions within an organism. With the aid of analytical techniques such as 2-DE, MS/MS, and shotgun proteomics, the field of proteomics has found useful application for the identification of biomarkers and mapping of epitopes that may provide targets for antimicrobial drug development. The field of metabolomics is a natural offshoot of proteomics as it uses many of the same MS techniques. A major difference, however, is that whereas genomics and proteomics provide insight into the potential of cellular processes, metabolomics gives an instantaneous snapshot of what is actually happening in a cell. Each one of these \u201comics\u201d fields generates massive amounts of rich, detailed data that surpass the capabilities of manual data analysis. This therefore necessitates the incorporation of bioinformatics for the development of computer algorithms that are used to analyze and model data. (Color version of figure is available online.)",
