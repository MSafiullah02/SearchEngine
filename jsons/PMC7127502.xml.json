Aging is associated with general deterioration of organ function in a way that dictates not only an individual\u2019s risk of developing pneumonia, but also clinical manifestations and outcomes. In addition to increased complexity of clinical presentation and more rapid progression of disease, older patients are at higher risk to have pneumonia owing to resistant organisms including Gram-negative bacilli, and therefore empiric as well as definitive treatment can be challenging. The incidence of pneumonia increases with age, as does the impact of pneumonia on morbidity and mortality.",

These factors include (1) impaired function of mucociliary clearance, an important defense mechanism against pathogen entrance to the upper airways and respiratory tree. Slower and less efficient clearance of secretions by the mucociliary system in the elderly has been shown to correlate with pneumonia.13 (2) Chest wall mobility and compliance decrease with aging owing to costovertebral joint alteration, rib cartilage calcification, loss of muscle strength, and changes in the shape of rib cage such as kyphosis or scoliosis. (3) Lung compliance is reduced owing to changes in lung parenchyma, which affect the lung\u2019s elastic recoil.6 These alterations in the chest wall and lung compliance lead to increased air trapping, reduced ability to clear secretions, and an increase in the workload of respiratory muscles. In older age, a further increase in the work of breathing, as occurs in cases of pneumonia and particularly in the presence of underlying diseases such as cardiovascular and lung diseases, compromise functionality during infection and may lead to respiratory failure.14\n",

Altered mentation and absence of cough or appropriate ventilator response also modify clinical presentation in the elderly, delay diagnosis and treatment, and consequently impact clinical outcomes.20, 21 The increased frequency of respiratory tract colonization in older adults22, 23, 24 leads to an increased likelihood of chemical aspiration developing into aspiration pneumonia.25\n",

Brito and Niederman77 reviewed several studies that evaluated patients with HCAP and proposed an algorithm that combined severity of illness and number of risk factors. In general, most of the studies included patients who were recently hospitalized, or arrived from LTCFs with severe CAP (ie, were admitted to the ICU). The most common resistant pathogens described in these studies were MRSA and P aeruginosa, as well as other gram-negative bacilli. Risk factors included in this algorithm were recent antibiotic therapy in the past 6 months, recent hospitalization in the past 3 months, the presence of immune suppression, and poor functional status as defined by inability to perform activities of daily living.77 According to the authors, patients with severe CAP and 1 risk factor should receive empiric broad spectrum antibiotic treatment, whereas patients who have nonsevere CAP needed to have 2 or more risk factors before broad spectrum therapy would be indicated. This algorithm might be useful as a supplement to clinical judgment when managing patients with pneumonia.",

Often, LTCFs have contracted services that provide portable chest radiographs; these portable chest radiographs have similar limitations to standard chest radiographs, as described. Further complicating the usefulness of chest radiographs in LTCFs is a lack of previous films for comparison.86 Nevertheless, several studies have reported that 75% to 90% of chest radiographs taken for evaluation of suspected pneumonia among LTCF residents showed evidence of pneumonia. Thus, chest radiograph should be conducted as part of the evaluation of pneumonia in LTCF residents.86, 92\n",

Guidelines for management of pneumonia in older adults, and particularly LTCF residents would be very useful to clinicians. Ideally, such guidelines would address not only the challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of elderly, but would address issues that have ethical implications, such where to treat older adults, and in end-of-life situations, how to best manage older adults with pneumonia. Whether pneumonia is the old man\u2019s friend or enemy depends on the clinical situation and the patient\u2019s perspective.",
