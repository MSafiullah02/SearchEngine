Globally, NoVs are estimated to be associated with 50% of all-cause AGE outbreaks and 18% of sporadic cases of AGE [1, 2]. Due to their low infectious dose, prolonged asymptomatic shedding, environmental stability and substantial strain diversity, NoVs are highly infectious and can be easily transmitted from person to person [1]. Outbreaks often occur in semi-closed settings, such as cruise ships, health care settings and schools, that favor person-to-person spread [3].",

ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein that is post-translationally cleaved into seven nonstructural proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major capsid protein VP1and minor capsid protein VP2, respectively [5]. Based on their complete VP1 amino acid sequences, NoVs can be classified genetically into ten different genogroups (GI to GX), but only GI, GII, GIV, GVIII, and GIX (formerly GII.15) are known to infect humans [6\u20138]. GI and GII NoVs are responsible for the majority of disease in humans, whereas GIV viruses are rarely detected. Each genogroup can be subclassified into genotypes. To date, viruses in these ten genogroups can be further divided into 49 confirmed capsid genotypes (9 GI, 27 GII, 3 GIII, 2 GIV, 2 GV, 2 GVI and 1 genotype each for GVII, GVIII, GIX and GX) based on amino acids of the complete VP1 and 60 confirmed P-types (14 GI, 37 GII, 2 GIII, 1 GIV, 2 GV, 2 GVI, 1 GVII and 1 GX) based on partial nucleotide sequences of the RdRp regions [8].",

GII.2[P16], GII.3[P12] and GII.17[P17] were the top three circulating genotypes during the study period, accounting for at least 32.6% (14/43), 20.9% (9/43), and 11.6 (5/43) of the NoV-positive outbreaks, respectively. The previous predominant genotype GII.4 Sydney2012 was only responsible for 7.0% (3/43) of the outbreaks, ranking fourth. The predominant genotypes of NoV during our study period varied according to surveillance year. Overall, GII.17[P17] genotypes predominated in outbreaks during 2014\u20132015, accounting for 62.5% (5/8) of the outbreaks. GII.3[P12] genotypes predominated in 2015\u20132016, causing 55.6% (5/9) of the outbreaks.

NoV was detected in 43 (84.3%) of the AGE outbreaks. GII NoV strains were largely predominant and responsible for 93.0% of laboratory-confirmed NoV outbreaks. Similar to other cities in the Northern Hemisphere [20\u201322], NoV outbreaks in Huzhou exhibited a clear seasonality, with a peak in the cool months (November-March) and a trough in the summer months. The majority of outbreaks (88.4%, 38/43) occurred in school settings, mainly in primary schools and kindergartens. A higher percentage of NoV outbreaks among schools was also observed in other regions of China [23, 24]. From January 2014 to December 2017, a total of 616 NoV outbreaks were reported to the National Public Health Emergency Event Surveillance System (PHEESS) in China. Among these outbreaks, 93% occurred in school settings, including 39% in primary schools, 22% in childcare facilities, and 20% in secondary schools. However, this differs from the United States and Europe, where long-term care facilities (e.g., nursing homes) were reported as the most common settings [25\u201327]. In China, young students stay in crowded, enclosed classrooms (with an average of 30\u201350 students per classroom), where the viruses are highly transmissible by close contact between students, particularly among young students with lower levels of hand hygiene [28]. In addition, the high rate of NoV outbreaks in schools may also be due to the surveillance bias among different institutions. The Chinese Ministry of Education requires schools to screen students attending kindergarten, primary, and junior high schools every morning to check for fever, vomiting, or diarrhea [24]. Therefore, the reporting of infectious diseases including NoV outbreaks is better in these school settings.",

From 2008 to 2012, 80% of typed NoV outbreaks were caused by GII.4 variants, including GII.4 2006b, New Orleans 2009, and Sydney2012. All of the sequenced GII NoVs belonged to the GII.4 genotype except one strain, which had a GII.b polymerase gene. From July 2014 to June 2018, NoV strains associated with the outbreaks in Huzhou exhibited important changes in the diversity of genotypes and the distribution of predominant types as compared to previous study data. At least eight genotypes were identified during the study period, including GI.6[P11], GI.5[P4], GII.2[P2], GII.6[P7], GII.4 Sydney[P31], GII.17[P17], GII.3[P12], and GII.2[P16].

In Beijing, the capital of China, 92.3% of the laboratory-confirmed NoV outbreaks occurred in kindergartens and elementary schools during 2014-2017, and the most commonly identified strains in outbreaks were GII.2[P16], GII.17[P17], and GII.3[P12] [30]. In Jinan, a city in eastern China, seven genotypes were prevalent in outbreaks of AGE from 2015 to 2017, while no GII.4 was identified [31]. From January 2015 to December 2018, the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported a total of 213 NoV outbreaks, most of which occurred in kindergartens and elementary schools. At least 83.6% of outbreaks were caused by GII recombinant strains, of which GII.4 Sydney [P31] accounted for only 0.5% [32]. Based on the above results, we speculate that non-GII.4 NoV plays an increasingly important role in the outbreaks of AGE in China.",

A novel GII.17 NoV strain first emerged in Asia in September 2014 and soon became the predominant genotype in some areas in Asia during the 2014\u20132015 winter season, but GII.17 appears to have had limited prevalence in other regions outside Asia, including Europe, Canada, and the United States [10, 33, 34]. By contrast, in late 2016, uncommon recombinant GII.2[P16] strains emerged as the major cause of AGE outbreaks in different countries and caused an increase in NoV activity worldwide [11\u201314]. In Huzhou, GII.17 was first detected in an outbreak in November 2014 and became the predominant strain in the first half of 2015, but after that, the prevalence of GII.17 declined rapidly. After GII.2[P16] emerged in December 2016, it went on to become the main genotype detected in outbreaks until June 2018. Compared with five outbreaks caused by GII.17 in 2014-2015, GII.2[P16] caused nine outbreaks in 2016-2017. GII.17[P17] outbreaks were concentrated in primary schools in Huzhou, while GII.2[P16] outbreaks had a larger epidemic range, occurring in all school types. The above results suggest that GII.2[P16] strains have superior epidemiological adaptability in Huzhou to GII.17[P17] strains. A similar finding was reported in Beijing, where the GII.2[P16] strains caused a larger number of outbreaks and had a broader epidemic range than GII.17[P17]. The factors that limit the spread of GII.17 are unknown. Such restrictions could be due to differences in the existing immunity of the population or differences between populations in the expression of NoV receptors [10, 35].",

Similarly, in our study, all GII.3[P12] outbreaks occurred in kindergartens and elementary schools, mainly affecting children under 12 years of age. Previous studies indicated that GII.3[P12] has been detected in sporadic cases of AGE in Huzhou since 2013, but it has never been the dominant type. However, in our study, GII.3[P12] surpassed GII.17 in the second half of 2015 and became the main genotype detected in NoV outbreaks in the 2015-2016 epidemic season. Similar findings were reported in Beijing, where GII.3[P12] was the major genotype responsible for outbreaks during 2015\u20132016 [30]. After so many years since its emergence, why did GII.12-GII.3 show a dominant position in outbreaks in the 2015-2016 season? The reason for this is unknown. Further analysis using long sequences covering the complete RdRp and VP1 region are required to explore the evolutionary dynamics of GII.3[P12] strains.",

Second, the number of outbreaks we investigated was relatively small. Due to surveillance bias, outbreak identification and reporting may differ across settings, and therefore, the most prevalent genotype in settings (especially for the settings outside the school system) with lower reporting rates may have been underrepresented in our analysis.",

Most NoV outbreaks were reported in the cool months (November-March) and occurred in primary schools and kindergartens. Compared to previous study data, differences in the diversity of genotypes and the distribution of predominant types were observed. The predominant NoV genotypes in outbreaks changed from GII.4 variants to GII.17[P17] in 2014-2015, GII.3[P12] in 2015-2016, and then GII.2[P16] in 2016-2018. Our findings demonstrate that non-GII.4 NoVs play an increasingly important role in the outbreaks in Huzhou. Continuous surveillance is needed to monitor the emergence of novel NoV strains and help control NoV outbreaks in the next epidemic season.\n",
