We observed a complete loss of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid on the surface of myeloid, erythroid and CD4 + T cells in Casd1-deficient mice. Although 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on multiple hematopoietic lineages was lost, there were no obvious defects in hematopoiesis. Interestingly, erythrocytes from Casd1-deficient mice also lost reactivity to TER-119, a rat monoclonal antibody that is widely used to mark the murine erythroid lineage. The sialic acid glyco-epitope recognized by TER-119 on erythrocytes was sensitive to the sialic acid O-acetyl esterase activity of the hemagglutinin-esterase from bovine coronavirus but not to the corresponding enzyme from the influenza C virus. During erythrocyte development, TER-119 + Ery-A and Ery-B cells could be stained by catalytically inactive bovine coronavirus hemagglutininesterase but not by the inactive influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase, while TER-119 + Ery-C cells and mature erythrocytes were recognized by both virolectins. Although the structure of the sialoglycoconjugate recognized by TER-119 was not chemically demonstrated, its selective binding to virolectins suggests that it may be comprised of a 7,9-di-O-acetyl form of sialic acid. As erythrocytes mature, the surfaces of Ery-C cells and mature erythrocytes also acquire an additional distinct CASD1-dependent 9-O-acetyl sialic acid moiety that can be recognized by virolectins from both influenza C and bovine coronavirus.",

It plays important roles in animal development, cellular recognition processes and host-pathogen interactions (Schauer 2009) . A common modification of sialic acid is 9-O-acetylation, which has been implicated in sialoglycan recognition and ganglioside biology. The hemagglutinins or hemagglutinin-esterases of type C influenza viruses and certain nidoviruses specifically recognize the 9-O-acetylated form of sialic acid, and this form of sialic acid is required for the entry of these viruses into human cells. Although we had previously inferred a role for sialic acid 9-O-acetylation in regulating Siglec-2 (Cariappa et al. 2009 ), we have demonstrated that many of the phenotypes on the basis of which earlier conclusions were made, actually resulted from a mutation that was traceable to a commercially available C57BL/6 strain of mice (Mahajan et al. 2016) .",

Using knock-down and over-expression studies in a human cell line, Arming et al. (2011) showed that CASD1 contributed to the 7-O-acetylation of GD3. Baumann et al. (2015) inactivated Casd1 in the near-haploid myeloid cell line HAP1 using CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing and demonstrated the loss of 9-O-acetyl moieties from sialo-glyconjugates in HAP1 cells lacking CASD1. Their studies implicated CASD1 in directly transferring acetyl moieties from acetyl-CoA to CMP-sialic acid. Whether CMP-sialic acid is the preferred substrate for the O-acetylation of sialic acid in vivo, however, remains to be established. In this report, we describe a mouse strain in which Casd1 has been deleted in the germline. Analysis of these mice demonstrated the loss of 9-Oacetylation of sialic acid on the surface of all hematopoietic cells examined. Based on the differential specificity of hemagglutinin esterases from influenza C and bovine coronavirus, we inferred that the murine erythroid lineage-specific epitope recognized by the TER-119 monoclonal antibody is comprised of a 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid glycoform that is completely lost in Casd1-deficient mice. The putative 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid glycoform can be detected early in erythroid differentiation from the Ery-A and Ery-B stages onward. We also observed that a distinct 9-O-acetyl sialic acid moiety also decorates cells of the erythroid lineage from the Ery-C stage onward including mature red blood cells.",

To assess the function of 9-O-acetyl sialic acids in vivo, we generated Casd1-deficient mice ( Figure 1A) . The influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase (CHE) that is known to be specific for 9-Oacetyl sialic acid was expressed as an Fc-fusion protein (CHE-Fc) (Muchmore and Varki 1987) . Inactivation of the esterase domain of CHE-Fc with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) yields CHE-FcD, which has been widely used as a specific probe of 9-O-acetyl sialic acid (Klein et al. 1994) . Using the CHE-FcD reagent, we evaluated the effect of Casd1 deficiency on sialic acid 9-O-acetylation in all hematopoietic lineages, focusing our analysis on the spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes.",

However, the Ery-A and Ery-B erythroid precursors that normally express the TER-119 epitope in wild-type mice do not express any 9-O-acetyl sialic acid that is detectable by CHE-FcD staining. Therefore, we decided to examine the relationship between 9-O-acetyl sialic acid and the TER-119 epitope in greater detail. The hemagglutinin-esterase from bovine coronavirus Mebus strain (BHE) also recognizes 9-O-acetyl sialic acid, but in a manner that is structurally distinct from CHE (Zeng et al. 2008 ). Furthermore, unlike CHE, the BHE lectin recognizes 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acid in addition to 9-O-acetyl sialic acid Bakkers et al. 2016) . Therefore, we expressed BHE as an Fc-fusion protein (BHE-Fc) analogous to the approach used to generate CHE-Fc. In addition, we also generated a catalytically inactive form of BHE-Fc bearing the S40A substitution (BHE-Fc-S40A) whose ability to bind 9-O-acetyl sialic acids is unhindered as previously described (Zeng et al. 2008) . We found that the TER-119 + CD71 + Ery-A and Ery-B precursors from wild-type mice exhibited strong staining with BHE-Fc-S40A but not with CHE-FcD ( Figures 3B and 4A ). This suggested to us that the TER-119 epitope may be recognized by the BHE virolectin but not by CHE. We next used murine RBCs to examine the interactions of the TER-119 epitope with CHE and BHE.",

Although treatment with BHE-Fc completely eliminated CHE-FcD binding, CHE only partially eliminated BHE-S40A-Fc binding ( Figure 4D ).

Of note, CASD1 is unable to use the unactivated form of sialic acid or other sialic acid that is already incorporated into sialoconjugates (e.g., fetuin (N-linked), bovine submandibular mucin (O-linked), 2,3/ 2,6-sialolactose, or GD3) as substrates. The authors proposed that the 9-O-acetylated CMP-sialic acid is subsequently incorporated into sialoglycans. CASD1 is widely expressed in most tissues (based on the Protein and RNA Expression Atlas); this may indicate that most 9-Oacetyl sialoglycans are generated in a CASD1-dependent manner (Uhl\u00e9n et al. 2015) . Salvage of sialic acids from dietary sialogycans may serve as an additional source of sialic acid, but it remains unclear if the 9-O-acetyl moiety is preserved during this process.

In addition, enzymatic activity corresponding to transferases and esterases capable of adding or removing these substitutions have been successfully enriched from subcellular fractions of tissues rich in O-acetylated sialic acids. Among these, CASD1 is the only mammalian enzyme that has been cloned and biochemically characterized; we have described the generation of a Casd1 knockout mouse in this study. However, our knowledge of the mammalian enzymes O-acetylating sialic acids remains incomplete and there has been a debate about the number of enzymes involved in generating the pool of 9-O-acetyl sialic acids in vivo. It remains to be established whether incorporation of 9-O-acetylated form of CMP-NANA into glycans is the only mechanism of generating 9-O-acetylated sialogycans. The complete loss of 9-O-acetyl sialic acids on the surface of erythroid, myeloid and CD4 T lineages suggests that at least in unmanipulated Casd1-deficient mice, CASD1 may be the only enzyme capable of acetylating sialic acids in the 9-OH position on these cell types.

However, further structural analysis will be required to establish this. The analysis of the ligand-bound structures of BHE and CHE shows that although there is some structural homology between the two hemagglutinins, they bind the 9-O-acetyl sialic acid ligand in opposite orientations (Zeng et al. 2008) . Thus, it is theoretically possible that the conformation of the specific 9-O-acetyl sialic acid glycoform recognized by TER-119 is sterically constrained in the context of a particular glycan that favors binding and recognition by BHE over CHE. Although both BHE and CHE are lectins fused to receptor-destroying enzymes, it is particularly interesting that the esterase and hemagglutinin activities appear to have evolutionarily converged at the level of the specific glyco-conformations of 9-O-acetyl sialic acids. Thus study reveals an additional layer of complexity and diversity among the O-acetylated sialic acids and establishes the developmental regulation of the sequential acquisition of two different forms of 9-O-acetyl sialic acid during murine erythroid differentiation.",

Bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin esterase (Mebus strain, Uniprot accession number, P15776.1) was cloned into the pFUSE-mFc2a vector (Invivogen) into the EcoRI and BglII sites. A catalytically dead variant of BHE-Fc (BHE-S40A-Fc) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The Fc-fusion proteins were expressed in 293 T cells and affinity purified using protein G. The CHE-FcD probe recognizes 9-Oacetyl sialic acids, and the BHE-S40A-Fc virolectin can bind both 9-Oacetyl and 7,9-di-O-acetyl sialic acids Bakkers et al. 2016) . Briefly, a two-step staining procedure with CHE-FcD as the primary and anti-human IgG1-PE (clone HP6017) as the secondary or with BHE-S40A-Fc as the primary and anti-mouse IgG2a-FITC (clone RMG2a-62) as the secondary antibody were used.",
