After receiving various anti-tumor treatments, the immunity of cancer patients will be suppressed, and the risk of infection will be greatly increased [3\u20136] .Liang found that cancer patients in SARS-CoV-2 infection had poorer outcomes [7]. However, neither Yang Xia [8] nor Hanping Wang [9] through there was a strong link between cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, so we will report the clinical features of cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection to provide further knowledge of this disease.",

Studies [10] found that the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine was effective in the prevention and treatment of NICP in all stages, and the response rate of symptoms such as fever, cough and fatigue were significantly increased in ordinary patients after taking lianhua qingwen granules. In the critical stage, modern medicine approaches can play a powerful role in patients\u2019 life support and the control of complications, xuebijing injection combination with modern medicine approaches can improve the cure rate. In addition, compared with the western medicine group, the chinese-western combined treatment group had shorter test negative conversion time, higher symptom improvement rate and shorter hospital stay. Therefore, the combination of Chinese medicine and western medicine was effective in the treatment of NICP. In our study, a total of 8 patients received combined therapy of traditional Chinese medicines and western medicines. 8 (89%) patients received oral antiviral treatment using Lianhua Qingwen granules and Arbidol. 3 severe patients were given additional intravenous Xuebijing injection. In addition, through the different stages of COVID-19 infection of the body dialectical, based on Lung Cleaning and Detoxifying Decoction, flexible use of Chinese medicine prescription. All patients were given antibiotics. 8 (89%) patients were given a combination of antibiotic treatments. 5 (56%) patients were given intravenous methylprednisolone. Immunoglobulin was provided to 3 (33%) patients (10\u201314 days). 7 (78%) patients were treated with oxygen inhalation (nasal catheter or mask), 4 (44%) were treated with high-flow oxygen inhalation, and one patient used non-invasive mechanical ventilation. From the clinical outcomes of these 8 patients, western combined therapy of traditional Chinese medicine was indeed an effective treatment method, but due to the limited case data, more clinical practice data were needed to evaluate.",

All other patients were still in hospital. According to the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment protocol for novel coronavirus infection released by the National Health Commission (version 6), D-dimmer rise, infection index rise, and chest CT progression may be clinical warning indicators for severe patients. In our study, a majority of patients had differing degrees of increased infection index, which may represent more prominent inflammation. 78% of patients had increased D-dimmer, and previous studies had found that D-dimmer increase was related to severity of illness [11, 12]. 56% of patients showed signs of multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, in other studies, early-stage chest CT examination mostly showed multiple, small patch-like shadows and interstitial changes [13], which may indicate that in cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections lung lesions progressed faster. But only 44% (including the dead) of patients had received treatment in the intensive care unit. Additionally, of the 5 cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections receiving anti-tumor treatment in the last year, only 2 (40%) also had been diagnosed as severe type, with the other (60%) diagnosed as ordinary type. This seems to indicate that cancer comorbidity may have no direct relationship with severe events.",
