            "text": "Porcine circoviruses (PCVs; family Circoviridae) are small, non-enveloped, DNA viruses containing an unique single-stranded circular genome (for reviews, see Lukert, 1999, Allan and Ellis, 2000). PCV-1 is considered apathogenic and ubiquitous throughout the world. PCV-2 on the other hand, has been associated with various disease syndromes in pigs, including congenital tremors, post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and recently also dermatitis/nephropathy syndrome (Allan et al., 2000b, Rosell et al., 2000, Thomson et al., 2000). The syndrome PMWS was first identified in 1991 in a Canadian SPF-herd and PCV-2 was subsequently associated with the disease (Allan and Ellis, 2000). PCV-2 has since been identified in association with cases of PMWS from other countries in Northern America, Europe and Asia (Allan et al., 1999, Choi et al., 2000, Fenaux et al., 2000, Mankertz et al., 2000, Mori et al., 2000, Wellenberg et al., 2000) but to date information on sero-prevalence and modes of virus transmission is limited. However, serum antibodies to PCV-2 seem to be widespread in the swine populations of those countries where testing has been carried out (Allan and Ellis, 2000). In the case of PMWS, other viruses such as porcine parvovirus (PPV) or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV; Allan and Ellis, 2000) as well as non-specific activation of the immune system (Allan et al., 2000a, Krakowka et al., 2001) have been demonstrated as cofactors in the full expression of disease syndromes.",

An extensive survey was initiated to determine the cause of the disease and possible mode of entry into the herd, but at the time no plausible explanation was found. In 1999, a retrospective sero-survey for antibodies to PCV-2 among Swedish pigs, revealed that the SPF-herd in question was sero-negative to the virus early in 1993 but later this year animals in the herd had sero-converted to PCV-2. Therefore, samples from the outbreak of EE were re-analysed with respect to PCV-2 and the results are presented herein.",

Once established, the herd has been completely closed to new animal material, but semen collected from conventional boars free from Aujeszky\u2019s disease virus (Quality Genetics, K\u00e4vlinge, Sweden) has continuously been used for artificial insemination (AI). A teaser boar was kept and this boar was occasionally also used for coverings. Due to the risk of PPV transmission via AI semen, sows were vaccinated against this virus and due to conventional handling of feed and straw sows were also vaccinated against the bacteria Erysipelothrix rhusiopatie. The herd is tested free from a number of pathogens\n1 (Wallgren and Vallgarda, 1993, Wallgren et al., 1999) and the overall pathogen load is considered to be low indicated by a high weight gain, a low incidence of medical treatments and a low mortality (Wallgren, 1994, Wallgren, 2000). In 1993 this farrow to finish herd comprised 25 sows and the production system was continuous, but with batchwise farrowings. During 1997 the herd increased to 50 sows and an age segregating system was introduced. The herd subsequently increased further and since 1999 it has comprised around 70 sows.",

The boars at the AI-station servicing the SPF-herd were all clearly sero-positive to PCV-2 (PI 57\u2013100%) at this time point. The serological status to PCV-2 among the dams was also reflected by the transfer of maternal antibodies to their offspring (Table 3\n). In litter 1, the offspring of sow no. 1 were all sero-negative to PCV-2 at 3 days of age, while the offspring of sow no. 2 raised in this litter (piglet nos. 5 and 9) showed the same high antibody levels as their siblings in litter 2. The offspring of sow no. 1 remained sero-negative at least until the age of 23 days but were strongly sero-positive to PCV-2 at the age of 21 weeks. The offspring of sow no. 2 were all strongly sero-positive to PCV-2 both during suckling and at the age of 21 weeks. Piglets in litter 3 were also sero-positive to PCV-2 at 3 days of age but had lower levels of antibodies compared to the offspring of sow no. 2. The maternal antibodies to PCV-2 in litter 3 quickly declined and by the age of 23 days all but one of the piglets were sero-negative. However, at the age of 21 weeks pigs from litter 3 were again strongly sero-positive to PCV-2. Thus, these observations show that maternal antibodies to PCV-2 were transferred to the offspring. The seven piglets remaining in the herd until 21 weeks of age were all strongly sero-positive to PCV-2 at that time, regardless of their antibody status during their new-born period. Taken together, these results point to an introduction of infectious PCV-2 into the herd in 1993 and a subsequent persistence of the virus in the herd.",

Interestingly, PCV-2 has also been associated with skin lesions in the porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (Allan et al., 2000b, Rosell et al., 2000, Thomson et al., 2000). The PCV-2 serology revealed that the SPF-herd was sero-negative at least until February 1993. Two months lather, around the EE outbreak, the pigs showed varying levels of antibodies to PCV-2. All the monitored piglets sero-converted later that year and the herd has remained sero-positive since. The serological evidence thus reveal an active infection with PCV-2. Further, the presence of serum IFN-\u03b1 in the young pigs also indicates viral activity amid the piglets. We therefore hypothesise that PCV-2 replicating in the na\u00efve piglets caused the skin lesions necessary for S. hyicus to gain access to the dermis, and thereby predisposed for the EE outbreak. Indeed, PCV-2 was also isolated from one of the EE affected piglets which is the first time this virus has been isolated in Sweden. Moreover, the introduction of PCV-2 in the herd coincided with the most pronounced reproductive disturbance ever recorded in the herd. Indeed, PCV-2 has been associated with reproductive problems (West et al., 1999), and the observed increases in number of stillborn piglets, percentage of small litters and repeat breeders may therefore have been caused by the introduction of the virus into the herd. Further, it is likely that the fertility problems were due to PCV-2 infection of na\u00efve or insufficiently immune pregnant sows and gilts as this type of reproductive signs at least became less evident when PCV-2 became established in the herd.",
