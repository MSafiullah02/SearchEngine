Nigeria's current national health systems cannot effectively respond to the growing needs of already infected patients requiring admission into Intensive care units (ICUs) for Acute Respiratory Diseases (ARDs) and SARS COV-2 pnuemonia.

The provision of quarantine or isolation facilities can also be a challenge in Africa and availability of rapid diagnostic kits for fast and reliable testing and diagnosis of the disease. Conclusion: There is an urgent need to put in perspective the realities peculiar to Nigeria, and explore available collective measures and interventions to address the Coronavirus pandemic.",

The COVID-19 was reported from Wuhan, the capital and major business city of Hubei province China. 1 In a very short time, the disease spread across China and cases have been reported with an exponential increase in morbidity and mortality rate. The disease has evolved and continues to be a very serious emergency across the globe and on March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic having met the epidemiological criteria of having infected more than 100,000 people in at least 100 countries. 2 symptoms, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. 3 Fatal outcomes can include lowerrespiratory tract illnesses, such as pneumonia and bronchitis, or in severe diseases ARDsand SARS. These complications are however more pronounced in patients with underlying health conditions such cardiopulmonary disease, immuno-compromised individuals, infants and the elderly. 4 The global mortality rate of COVID-19 is currently estimated to be 3.41%. 5 The virological characteristics of coronaviruses may suggest lower survival rates of these pathogens in tropical Africa. However, shortly after the virus appeared in late 2019, experts warned of the risks of its spreading in Africa because of the continent's close commercial links with Beijing and the fragility of its medical services.",

This value is less than that calculated from the global figures (CFR= 0.06) ( Table 1 ). The actual numbers of people infected are not known-as apparently healthy peoples are not tested except they have a travel history to high index countries within a stipulated time period. Given the foregoing, we suggest the number of infected persons could be more. This could lead to under reporting of COVID-19 associated deaths as already suggested in other countries. 7 Also, though the recorded cases and estimated mortality rate may seem low (Table1), it may be important to recall that as at today Nigeria is the largest black nation with a population of over In addition, it is currently projected that Africa will have a fair share of the worst effects of this disease by the end of the pandemic. 8 More so, African countries are known to have fragile health systems and this remains a source of concern especially in the event of increased outbreaks. If these cases continue to escalate, as has been estimated -that between 9-11% of infected patients will eventually need critical care and require intensive care daily. 9 Africa's current national health systems cannot effectively respond to the growing needs of those For Nigeria, with the largest population on the continent, it is pertinent to emphasize that improving the surveillance systems will go a long way in containing importation of the deadly virus and the consequent spread within the African region. Strengthening regional cooperation of all health institution in Africa and activation of stricter policies at the ports of entry will go a long way to forestall unexpected outbreaks going forward. Furthermore, the efforts at early detection and diagnosis can be more appreciated if time lags between tests and diagnosis are clearly reduced to encourage more people testing to contain the spread of COVID-19.",

In the few instances where modern facilities are present, they are reserved for the elites.Although, the arrival of the virus into the continent has seen an influx of philanthropic gestures occasioned to provide palliative measures such as ambulatory services and makeshift facilities.However, COVID-19 has once again brought to the fore the underlying need to as a matter of urgency dedicate resources in the provision of standard critical care facilities such as modern equipped laboratories, resilient ICUs and hospital facilities including beds, ventilators and training of human resources. There is therefore an emergent need to scale up the ICU units in Africa including Nigeria. of quarantine or isolation facilities can also be a challenge in Africa. While the continent may lack the expertise for the timely tracing of contacts with an infected victim.COVID-19 pathogen represents a particular challenge in that it is difficult to detect. The virus may be present in an individual who has few or no symptoms, allowing it to spread quietly in African countries that typically have a shortage of equipment especially diagnostic tools as in the case of the Italian index case who was only detected in Nigeria 48 hours after entering into the country.4 In the eventuality of the current predictions of more cases, Africa with their albeit fragile economies and health systems ultimately stand disadvantaged. The effect will be more evident in higher deaths recorded. Hence, the need for a coordinated international response to the current pandemic COVID-19 virus cannot be over emphasized given the foregoing especially in Africa.It is necessary for African leaders and policy makers to utilize the rare opportunity opened up by the COVID-19 outbreak to begin the strengthening of the public health system, disease surveillance, while managing suspected cases of COVID-19 in other to avert impending disaster through further negligence in Africa.The current collaborative efforts from the World Health Organization, Federal and state government health ministries, health institutes, Non-governmental organizations, researchers are desirable. The Africa Center for Disease Control (Africa CDC) has been at the frontline of leading the continent's response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The center has been building capacity of nations for country preparedness and response to the disease including prompt case identification, diagnosis and use of smart approaches to educate and sensitize the continent about the infection. Similarly, the efforts of the African WHO Regional office is quite commendable.The office has consistently provided updated information about the evolving disease and has materials to member countries with the aim to halt or at best limit the spread of the infection across Africa. To further strengthen countries, preparedness there has been ongoing sensitization of communities, training of health workers and strengthening of surveillance mechanisms in communities.",
