[10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Although the trachea is lined with respiratory epithelia, which readily support colonization by a diverse microbiome at other upper respiratory sites such as the oropharynx, 19, 20 to date nothing is Editor known of the composition of the resident microbiome of the large airway or its contribution to airway remodeling in idiopathic subglottic stenosis. Microbiological studies that rely on culture-based techniques underestimate the diversity of species present 10 and offer limited detection of intracellular pathogens. The application of cultureindependent approaches offers the opportunity to both provide a broader picture of tracheal microbiome composition and identify discrete pathogenic species associated with disease states.",

Our unbiased molecular interrogation of the tracheal microbiota of iSGS patients provides detailed nucleic acid, protein, and immunologic evidence to demonstrate Mycobacterium species within tracheal scar. Together with our previous work, these studies offer new insights into the pathogenesis of iSGS. They suggest that human tracheal mucosal health is highly dependent on the composition of the resident microbiota, identify a novel pathogenic role for established large airway bacteria, and offer targets for future therapeutic interventions.",

Similarly, all iSGS patients included in our study were culture-negative. However, since this publication in 1993, culture-independent techniques have become an established alternate methodology for identification of infectious agents. Polymerase chain reaction was used to identify the etiologic agents of bacillary angiomatosis (Bartonella henselae) 35 and Whipple's disease (Tropheryma whippelii). 36 (A) Yellow indicates positive PCR products; blue indicates negative result. Ten of 10 iSGS patients had detectable PCR products for mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MtbC), compared with two of 10 iLTS patients (two-tailed, chi-squared test with continuity correction; P < 0.001). (B) Representative images from in situ hybridization for RNA of Mycobacterium gene product gyraseA (arrows depicting positive signal in iSGS specimen). Accompanying summary graph depicting seven of 10 iSGS patients with detectable in situ hybridization signal, compared with one 10 iLTS and 0 of 10 controls (two-tailed, chi-squared test; asterisk denotes P < 0.001). Immunogold labeling with an anti-MtbC antibody and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses revealed multiple structures with associated labels that exhibit typical size (500 nm-2 lm) and shape (coccoid or bacillus) of Mycobacterium spp. Treatment with secondary antibody alone (not shown) or an unrelated antibody to Haemophilus influenzae (C) revealed sparse labeling that was significantly less than the labeling achieved with the anti-Mtb treatment (D, E). Distribution of IFN-c production from ESAT-6 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from the peripheral blood of iSGS patients (red; n 5 10) or healthy controls (green; n 5 10). Bars represent the median (50th percentile), asterisk denotes significance (two-tailed, Mann Whitney test; P < 0.005) (F).

However, based on prior microbiological experience with fastidious mycobacteria, there are several explanations for the failure to detect microbial species in iSGS in the initial reports of the disease: The bacteria may be present in quantities below the detection of histologic staining. 41 Alternatively, the agent may have an ultraslow growth pattern that necessitates incubation periods much longer than the standard 6 weeks that cultures are held for isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is similar to the time needed for isolation of M. ulcerans. 42 Conversely, iSGS pathogenesis may reflect an immune response to infectious antigens and might not be dependent on actively replicating organisms, which is similar to the hypersensitivity pneumonitis that is induced by Mycobacterium avium. 43 An association between Mycobacterium and iSGS immunopathogenesis is supported by the detection of mycobacterial proteins and nucleic acids in iSGS scar, as well as local and peripheral cellular immune responses to mycobacterial antigens in iSGS subjects. However, it remains unresolved whether the identified mycobacterial constituents drive disease or whether inflammation per se creates a niche for the outgrowth of specific bacteria. It should be noted, however, that tracheal stenosis arising after intubation (iLTS; which also possess an inflammatory tissue phenotype in the airway) appears in our cohort to have a much lower percentage of patients with detected Mycobacterium. Given the disease rarity, these results will require confirmation in larger cohorts pooled from multiple institutions.",

Lady Windermere patients are predominantly Caucasian (86%) women (81%) presenting in their mid-sixties.

Similarly, although iSGS affects women nearly exclusively, the influence of estrogen on disease initiation and recurrence is unknown. Estrogen has been shown to directly drive IL-23/IL-23R signaling and increase IL-17A production in severe asthma. 49 The role of estrogen in promoting mycobacterial colonization/ infection, or its role in accelerating the host response to pathogen, are questions meriting future study.",

Together with prior reports demonstrating significantly upregulated local IL-17A, evidence of Mycobacterium species within tracheal scar offers new avenues for therapeutic intervention in iSGS patients. Several established reagents are available to inhibit the IL-17A pathway. [50] [51] [52] Alternatively, multiple drugs are available targeting Mycobacterium species. Interestingly, limited cases series supports a clinical benefit for one of these reagents in iSGS patients. 1 The benefit of IL-17A inhibition in the absence of pathogen control is unclear; thus, future clinical trials could test the clinical response of immunomodulation in combination with antibacterial therapy.
