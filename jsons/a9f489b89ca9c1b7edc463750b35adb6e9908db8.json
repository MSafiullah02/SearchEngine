            "text": "NY), Chicago, Baltimore and Los Angeles since the beginning of the 2020. Data was gathered from the Police Departments (PDs) of each city and from the FBI. Trends were determined by comparing gun related incidents/victims/deaths where applicable to 2018 and 2019 to determine what effect, if any, COVID-19 has had on gun violence.According to the NYPD, as of April 4 there has been 172 shooting incidents which represent an 11.7% increase compared to 2019 and an 18.6% increase compared to 2018.4 Similarly, the Baltimore PD reports 180 shooting incidents as of April 4, a 2.0% increase compared to 2019. 5 In Chicago, the PD reports 516 shooting incidents since for 2020, a 23% increase compared to 2019 and a 6% increase compared to 2018. 6 In contrast, Los Angeles PD reports a 9.3% decrease compared to 2019 but 10.3% increase compared to 2018(Figure 1). heavily populated cities of NY, Chicago and Baltimore, there is a paradoxical trend of increased gun related violence in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We offer several possible explanations.According to a report from the US Department of Labor, there has been a surge in number of unemployment claims during the pandemic.8  Many companies are being forced to layoff workers in order to prevent financial bankruptcy, while other industries, such as restaurants and entertainment, are simply not open for business. Maryland has received 298,610 unemployment claims which represents 9.1% of the state's labor force since March 14, New York State 1,186,994 unemployment claims (12.4% of its' labor force), and Illinois 634,625 unemployment claims (9.9% of its' labor force). 8 With an increasing number of people unemployed, it is possible that the chances of becoming involved in a gun related incident correlates with the amount of time spent outside of the workplace. Another explanation is that as people with low socioeconomic status become unemployed and experience tremendous financial stress, they may resort to robbery for income, which is reflected in the increased robbery rates in NY (22.4%) and Chicago (10%) compared to 2019.",
