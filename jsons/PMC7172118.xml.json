The variable whose elimination caused the least significant deterioration of model fit was removed and the process repeated until all variables were significant at P\u22640.20 [24]. Age and sex were retained as they are associated with incidence of influenza and other viral respiratory infections [25].

All of these studies identified the exposure of healthcare personnel to household contacts as having the highest odds of respiratory illness after exposure, with ORs ranging from 2.9 to 16.7.

Outbreaks of viral respiratory infection involving substantial transmission among staff have been identified [12,17]. Vanhems et al. [18] found the risk of influenza-like illness among patients and staff to be interlinked, but Choi et al. [19] identified no increased risk associated with exposure to ill colleagues. The proportion of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic illness in healthcare personnel thought to be due to transmission from colleagues ranged from 3.1% to 23% in different cohorts [11,14,15,17,[19], [20], [21],26]. Some of these differences may be due to study methods. For instance, Choi et al.\u2018s study was a retrospective questionnaire administered more than 1 year after the first wave of the pandemic, and illness in colleagues may have been under-reported. Other disparities may be due to true differences in hospital design or infection prevention practices. Another issue is the attribution of exposure sources. In some studies, multiple contacts were attributed to only one source \u2013 patients in some instances \u2013 while other studies failed to assess the impact of community contacts [17,20,27]. Future transmission of viral respiratory infection studies in healthcare personnel need to assess the impact of a variety of potential sources including patients, co-workers, household, non-household (social/community) and contemporaneous (i.e. non-attributable) exposures.",

In this cohort, only 9\u201313% of viral illnesses were probably or possibly associated with exposure to a symptomatic patient. The facts that over 35% of viral infections had no known exposure, that HCPs with direct patient contact were more likely to develop infection, and that recognized exposure to patients with acute respiratory illness was not a risk, suggest that exposure to undetected and unsuspected viral respiratory illness may be a greater risk to healthcare providers than exposure to identified patients. This is not surprising given the evidence that influenza infection in the frail elderly often presents atypically [28,29], and that a non-trivial percentage of influenza infections are asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic [30,31]. The present findings also suggest that isolating and measuring the risk to healthcare personnel from recognized patients with viral illness is difficult; the findings in different studies that healthcare personnel wearing different types of protective equipment have similar rates of viral infection may be because most infections are a result of non-occupational exposures or exposures to patients not recognized as ill, rather than because the different types of protective equipment provide similar levels of protection [32,33].",

However, several other studies, including those summarized in at least three systematic reviews, provide evidence that personal protective equipment reduces the risk of transmission of infection [[34], [35], [36]]. The present results may be due to a lack of power or could be explained by differences in reported and actual behaviour, misuse of protective equipment and/or transmission from non-patient sources. Jessee and Mion report that nurses' self-reported adherence to precautions was significantly higher than observed behaviour, reflecting high levels of knowledge about precautions but also social desirability bias in answering survey questions [37]. Although some healthcare personnel may disregard or fail to recall recommended precautions (approximately 11% of healthcare personnel in this study reported limited use of protective equipment when caring for patients with a febrile respiratory illness), Krein et al. report that many healthcare personnel in their study made inadvertent mistakes when using protective equipment, putting themselves at risk of exposure [38].",

This finding is consistent with several recent publications in which influenza vaccination was confirmed to be protective against laboratory-confirmed influenza for healthcare personnel [[39], [40], [41]], and reinforces the benefits of ongoing vaccination programmes in healthcare facilities. In this cohort, household members, social contacts and co-workers represent approximately 80% of the known sources associated with influenza while exposure to patients represents the other 20%. These findings highlight the importance of vaccination programmes to protect vulnerable patients from influenza transmission via their healthcare provider.",

Given that 95% of healthcare personnel in this cohort attended work while symptomatic with an acute respiratory illness [22], the potential for worker-to-worker and/or healthcare worker-to-patient transmission is high. Providing care to patients with undetected viral respiratory infection may explain why reported exposure to patients with an acute respiratory illness was not a risk factor for infection while having physical contact with patients was a risk factor.",
