The intein-encoded protein region is removed by an autocatalytic protein-splicing reaction that ligates the host protein flanks with a peptide bond. This reaction can also occur in trans with the intein and host protein split in two. After translation of the two genes, the two intein parts ligate their flanking protein parts to each other, producing the mature protein. Naturally split inteins are only known in the DNA polymerase III alpha subunit (polC or dnaE gene) of a few cyanobacteria. Analysing the phylogenetic distribution and probable genetic propagation mode of these split inteins, we conclude that they are genetically fixed in several large cyanobacterial lineages. To test our hypothesis, we sequenced parts of the dnaE genes from five diverse cyanobacteria and found all species to have the same type of split intein. Our results suggest the occurrence of a genetic rearrangement in the ancestor of a large division of cyanobacteria. This event fixed the dnaE gene in a unique two-genes one-protein configuration in the progenitor of many cyanobacteria. Our hypothesis, findings and the cloning procedure that we established allow the identification and acquisition of many naturally split inteins. Having a large and diverse repertoire of these unique inteins will enable studies of their distinct activity and enhance their use in biotechnology.",

The intein protein is removed from the host protein by a pro-tein-splicing reaction that joins the intein flanks with a peptide bond. This reaction is autocatalytic, fully catalysed by the intein and the residue C-terminal to it, with no need for other proteins, ATP or such molecules (Paulus, 2000) . It is typically a cis intramolecular reaction but can also occur when the N-and C-terminal parts of the intein are split and encoded on separate protein chains, each with its own flank. A trans protein-splicing reaction then ligates the flanks of the two intein parts (Shingledecker et al ., 1998; Southworth et al ., 1998) . A split intein is naturally present in the dnaE genes of a few cyanobacteria (Gorbalenya, 1998; Kaneko et al ., 2001; Nakamura et al ., 2002) . Inteins are active with various flanks, in heterologous organisms and in vitro . Biochemical studies of the protein-splicing mechanism led to the use of typical and split inteins in diverse biotechnology applications (Perler and Adam, 2000; Ozawa et al ., 2001; Mootz and Muir, 2002) .",

The primary process seems to be independent of gradual loss of intein elements from separate species during evolution (Pietrokovski, 2001) . Inteins are not known to contribute any advantage to their host genes or species and are believed to be selfish genetic elements (Belfort et al ., 1995) . Active selection against inteins seems to be relatively weak because of their apparent negligible disruption of their host genes, protein products and organisms. Intein removal from the genome requires a precise DNA excision event as they are inserted in highly conserved points of genes coding for essential proteins (Derbyshire and Belfort, 1998) . Counteracting this slow extinction is horizontal transfer to specific integration points, e.g. homing (Belfort and Roberts, 1997) . Most intein proteins include a homing endonuclease domain that can mediate insertion of their intein gene into homologous unoccupied intein integration points (Gimble and Thorner, 1992) . Hence, homing activ-ity of inteins can reinsert their gene into integration sites that they were lost from.",

Underlined filled bullets denote split DnaE inteins identified and sequenced in this work ( Aphanizomenon , Aphanothece , Oscillatoria and Thermosynechococcus vulcanus ). The relations shown between the groups are the most probable ones but are not as certain as the group definitions (Honda et al ., 1999) . Listed for each group are species with known DnaE or DnaE intein sequences or a representative species chosen from the groups of Honda et al . (1999) . The listed Aphanothece and Oscillatoria species 16S rRNA sequences were significantly most similar to each other (931/1000 bootstrap value). They were closest to group 2 species but could not be definitely clustered with it. Centre. A dendogram calculated from conserved DnaE polymerase protein regions spanning 409 amino acids. The dendogram is rooted by the position of all cyanobacterial DnaE protein regions within a larger dendogram of DnaE proteins from various bacteria (not shown). Right. A dendogram calculated from conserved split DnaE intein sequences spanning 132 amino acids (see Fig. 4A ). The dendogram is rooted by the position of all split DnaE inteins within a larger dendogram of various inteins (not shown). Bootstrap confidence values for grouping of DnaE proteins and split inteins (values at the root) are from the larger dendograms. Bootstrap confidence values for DnaE polymerase and intein dendograms calculated from 1000 trials. Nodes below values of 700/1000 were collapsed. Therrmosynechococcus vulcanus sequences are not included in the analysis as only a small part upstream of its DnaE1 intein was determined. Nevertheless, the determined sequences of the intein and polymerase regions are very similar to T. elongatus BP-1, and the two species are expected to cluster together. the distribution of known split DnaE inteins is probably the result of regular vertical transmission. We hypothesized that, as split DnaE inteins are present in species from three diverse cyanobacterial groups, they might be very common, or even invariably present, in other species from these groups and maybe also in other related groups ( Fig. 2A) .",

The next reaction amplified the 3\u00a2 region of the previous reaction and a downstream region, using a specific 5\u00a2 primer and a degenerate 3\u00a2 primer. Typically, two or three such reactions sufficed to determine the sequence up to the insertion site. To amplify the less conserved Nintein region and its downstream 3\u00a2 untranslated region, a linear amplification using a single specific 5\u00a2 primer was followed by terminal transferase polycytosine tailing. Products from this reaction were then reamplified by a specific internal 5\u00a2 primer and a polyguanosine primer. Finally, the sequence was verified by amplifying from genomic DNA the intein part with upstream and downstream regions using specific primers. The C-intein part of the dnaE2 gene was cloned similarly with the amplification reactions proceeding in the reverse orientation -advancing from the dnaE2 central region towards its 5\u00a2 end.",

The original genomic rearrangement that split the dnaE gene thus seems to have been followed by further genomic rearrangements. Nostoc species PCC 7120 and related cyanobacteria undergo developmentally regulated genome rearrangements (Golden et al., 1987; Carrasco and Golden, 1995) . These are species in which split dnaE genes also occur. It is possible that some cyanobacteria are more tolerant to genome rearrangements. Such events produce split genes that are reactivated by regulated rearrangements. One rearrangement may have split A. DnaE1 (top) and DnaE2 (bottom) intein parts. The start position of each intein is shown in their host proteins, except for the DnaE1 sequences determined in this work where only the 3\u00a2 parts of the genes were determined. Asterisks indicate stop codons. Underlined regions are intein conserved sequence motifs (Pietrokovski, 1998) . Lower case sequence regions in the C\u00a2 end of the DnaE1 intein parts are not conserved in these sequences and should not be considered aligned. Below the sequence alignment is a graphical representation of it (Henikoff et al., 1995) a dnaE gene in its intein region. However, the two dnaE gene parts could reassemble at the protein level by their intein regions.",

They could also be a valuable source in theoretical and experimental studies of proteinprotein interaction and intein catalytic activity (Gorbalenya, 1998; Martin et al., 2001) . From a practical aspect, our ability to obtain an apparently very large number of different DnaE split inteins will be enhanced. For example, the Pasteur Culture Collection of Cyanobacteria (PCC) maintains about 475 axenic strains, many belonging to the groups in which we believe DnaE split inteins are fixed. Of particular interest will be split inteins from species living in extreme conditions such as high temperature or salinity.

Cyanobacterial DnaE proteins are split by inteins in a highly conserved motif appearing in all known DnaE proteins (Fig. 4B ). This strongly suggests that the two split DnaE host protein parts would have to be attached by a peptide bond at the intein integration point for the motif to adopt the fold, and have the activity, found in other DnaE proteins. Loss of one or both intein parts will leave the products of their gene flanks split with no mechanism to ligate. To lose the intein genes and retain a functional dnaE gene requires parallel precise loss of the intein parts followed directly by precise fusion of their flanks into one gene; this is a highly unlikely event.",

Gene splitting would require acquiring a promoter and translation initiation signal for the downstream part of the split gene, adapting co-regulation for the two formed genes and evolving amino acid sequences to stabilize the two new ends of the intein parts. Gene splitting of the intein might also require adaptation for trans-splicing and high-affinity interaction between the two intein parts. Artificially created split inteins were found to have some affinity between their two parts and a low level of trans-splicing (Shingledecker et al., 1998; Southworth et al., 1998; Mootz and Muir, 2002) . Thus, adapting the protein function of a newly split intein gene might be the minor difficulty compared with adapting proper transcription and translation control and protein stability. Once all these adaptations were complete, the unidirectional ratchet nature of the intein-splitting process would ensure the evolutionary persistence of the gene organization. However, still unknown are what initial circumstances led to the selection of the individual cyanobacterium in which the intein splitting occurred.

Next, linear (single primer) amplifications were done towards each split intein part using specific primers, designed from the previously amplified regions. The 3\u00a2 (intein) ends of the single-stranded amplification products were tailed by a homo-oligomer using terminal transferase. The tailed products were then PCR amplified by a primer complementary to the homo-oligomer tail and a second specific primer, nested to the first specific primer (Rudi et al., 1999) .
