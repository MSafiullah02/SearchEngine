It was not uncommon in the early twentieth century to treat pneumonia with x-rays. A review showed low doses from kilovoltage x-rays reduced pneumonia mortality from roughly 30 percent to 10 percent on average.[2] Doses reported were generally in the 20 \u2013 few hundred Roentgen range, which given the attenuation through chest wall would likely have resulted in mean lung doses in the tens to < 100 cGy range. Some reports noted rapid symptom relief on the order of hours [3], [4] Animal models suggested LDRT could reduce the acute phase of pneumonia by half.[5] In light of the current mortality rates associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, it is therefore reasonable to re-examine this old treatment.",

In a viral infection, viruses trigger immune cells to synthesize pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,[6] inciting the immune response. Historical evidence points to the induction of an anti-inflammatory phenotype induced by low doses of radiation as a potential explanation for the observed effects.[2] While doses \u2265 200 cGy tends to exert pro-inflammatory effects, triggering common toxicities observed in radiation therapy, more recent work shows low doses (< 100 cGy) incite anti-inflammatory properties[7], [8] such as decreasing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\u03b2 [9], or inhibiting leukocyte recruitment [10]. Therefore, it stands to reason that an LDRT treatment of 30 to 100 cGy to the lungs of a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia could reduce the inflammation and relieve the life-threatening symptoms.",

Routinely, much higher, single fraction doses are delivered in a palliative context with fast-tracked patients going through the full workflow process of education, scanning, planning and treatment delivery in a matter of hours. Proof of principle simulations suggest that a POP treatment with a megavoltage beam could easily ensure 99% of the whole lung volume received between 90% and 120% of a 70 cGy prescribed dose. And because of the low doses, common radiotherapy toxicities would be avoided.",
