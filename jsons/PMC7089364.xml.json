To date, the original CPV-2 has been completely substituted by three major genetic and antigenic variants, termed as CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c, identified in 1980, 1984, and 2000, respectively [3\u20136]. The virus has a high genomic substitution rate similar to those of RNA viruses [7] and undergoes continuous evolution [8]. Nowadays, CPV-2a is a prevalent CPV-2 field strain circulating in China [9].",

CPV-2 is involved in induction of apoptosis in several cell lines, including Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells [16, 17]. However, the evidence is ambiguous and very limited. To further investigate CPV-2 infection-induced cell effect and the underlying mechanism of CPV-mediated cellular regulation, we established a persistently infected MDCK cell line with CPV-2a, isolated in China, and performed the transcriptome microarray analyses in an attempt to obtain a clearer understanding of how CPV-2a infects MDCK cells and how CPV-2a regulates host gene expression in its susceptible cells, hopefully stimulating insight into the development of antiviral strategy and identification of nanomaterial for medicine.",

Cell morphology of each passage was observed under microscope; meanwhile, cell supernatants of each generation were collected for virus VP2 gene detection by PCR assay. We found that in the early stage after CPV-2a infection, MDCK cells showed a lower cell growth rate with a stretched amorphous until the fourth generation compared to the normal MDCK (Fig. 1a, b). Another 12 h were needed for the fourth generation cells to grow to a monolayer compared to mock-infected cells (36 h). After five times of passages, MDCK proliferate and cell morphology gradually restored to normal. As to the tenth passage, MDCK showed a visible normal state under microscopy without cytopathic effect (CPE) (Fig. 1c). Cell culture supernatants of each passage were collected for CPV-2a gene detection using PCR assay. The CPV-2a viral DNA could be detected in each passage of cell supernatants, which indicated that CPV-2a proliferate as cell passage (Fig. 2a). Band intensity analysis revealed that VP2 gene level increased as cell passage until the fourth generation. Subsequently, viral gene expression gently decreased to achieve a relatively stable value till the tenth generation (Fig. 2b). In addition, we determined the gene copies numbers of CPV-2a in the supernatant of infected MDCK cells and found that CPV-2a copies increased before the fourth generation, but do not appear to add up after fourth generation, which is consistent with the result of PCR assay (Fig. 2c). Collectively, CPV-2a showed a persistent infection in MDCK cells and proliferated as cell growth, but failed to cause CPE in MDCK. After ten times of passages with cells, virus copies quantitated with cell count reached a relatively stable state in MDCK cells. These results demonstrated that steady-infected MDCK cells with CPV-2a were generated here.\n\n",

Compared with uninfected MDCK cells, under the screening criteria of a >1.5-fold change (FC) and p < 0.05, about 660 protein-coding genes showed significantly differential expression in stably infected MDCK cell, among which ~360 genes (0.83 % of total genes on the arrays) were up-regulated and ~300 genes (0.8 % of total genes on the arrays) were down-regulated (Fig. 4).

We found that CPV-2a-induced genes profiling are mainly grouped in MHC proteins or MHC-related complexes (Fig. 5), which usually play roles in identifying and presenting exogenous or endogenous peptides to immune cells, and to initiate immune response [24, 25], including several central factors MHCI/II, TAP1/2, B2M, LGP2, MDA5, IRF7, and IFN-\u03ba et al. However, the genes down-regulated by CPV-2a showed no obvious enrichment to any cellular component and biology process (Table 2).

The results of KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these up-modulated genes, highly enriched in MHC proteins or MHC-related complexes, were involved in multiple signaling pathways associated with virus\u2013host interaction, including antigen processing and presentation signaling, virus\u2013host network signaling, and immune response signaling (Table 3). The most interesting signaling pathways included the well-characterized antigen processing and presentation pathway (Fig. 6) and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway (Fig. 7). Antigen processing and presentation pathway is the essential way for conversion of exogenous and endogenous proteins into immunogenic peptides via a series of proteolytic events mediated by antigen-presenting cell (APC) [26, 27], which is an important mechanism for induction of immunity to pathogen. In the CPV-2a-infected MDCK cells, many central genes of this pathway involved in MHC proteins or MHC-related complex proteins showed significant up-regulation, e.g., MHCI/II, HSP70, TAP1/2, B2 m, SLIP, and CLIP. In addition, RLR is a specific group of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) families responsible for detecting viral pathogens and generating innate immune responses [28\u201330]. As shown in Fig. 7, many key regulators, such as LGP2, MDA5, IRF7, and IFN were significantly increased after CPV-2a infection, which suggested that CPV-2a could activate RLR signaling pathway.\n\n\n",

The results showed that CPV-2a induces a series of differentially expressed genes. Interestingly, GO annotation showed that the up-regulated genes contains a number of membrane-associated factors, including many MHC proteins or MHC-related complexes (Fig. 5). MHC molecules are a class of membrane-associated protein, present on the surface of APCs, which identify and present exogenous or endogenous peptides to immune cells, so as to initiate immune response [24, 25]. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that these genes are closely related to signaling pathways of virus\u2013host interaction, including antigen processing and presentation pathway, intestinal immune network, graft-versus-host disease and RLR signaling pathway (Table 3). RLRs, together with Toll-like receptors and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, are three major receptor systems of PRRs in innate immunity for recognition of microorganisms in various cells [28] and are responsible for activation of antiviral immune responses (Fig. 6 , 7). Our qPCR data also confirmed that CPV-2a infection activates immune-related genes (Fig. 8). All these results demonstrated that CPV-2a is a great immune activation agent. Actually, many other parvoviruses infection has been reported to activate immune response in virus-induced cell lines [35\u201338]. Our results provided direct evidences that CPV-2a is also a potential immune cell activator. In contrast, down-modulated genes by CPV-2a are mainly involved in pathways linking to amino acid synthesis and metabolism (Table 3), including glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, indicating that CPV-2a infection may affect cell metabolism.",

By the reasons of these properties, parvovirus was widely used as delivery vectors for inducing host immune responses and antitumor effects. Parvovirus-based antitumor nanotools were rapidly developed in past two decades [36\u201339]. As a member of parvovirus, CPV-2a causes severe disease in dogs, whereas it is not susceptible to many other species including human. Interestingly, infectious CPV particles could be confirmed to bind and enter human cells, but viral replication could not be accomplished [14]. In addition, CPV-2a has a specific cellular receptor, transferrin receptor, which is a characteristic high expressed carrier protein in tumor cells [40]. It provides the possibility to deliver drugs specifically to tumor cells utilizing CPV vector. Indeed, CPV, and CPV virus-like particles have been employed in drugs delivery and CPV is being investigated as a novel nanomaterial for delivery of genes and tumor targeting [41]. Together with our studies that CPV-2a activates the immune response signaling in susceptible cells, all these results suggested that CPV-2a is natural immune cell activator and antitumor vector. Nevertheless, several questions need further investigations. For example, which components are responsible for activation of immune-related signaling, viral structural proteins, nonstructural proteins, or nucleic acid? And how the CPV-2a activates immune signaling?",

Yet, some studies mentioned that CPV-2a induces apoptosis [15, 17], but our gene profiling data showed no connection between CPV-2a infection and apoptosis, which may be attribute to the virus types. This work extends our knowledge of CPV-2a-mediated cell infection and regulation. These findings will pave ways for developing novel antiviral strategy and nanomaterial for medicine.",
