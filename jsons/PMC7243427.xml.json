            "text": "Structural studies of RdRp and NiRAN were performed using Modeler v9.23. Because of the lack\nof a suitable template, only a.a.s from 117\u2013895 of nsp12 were modeled. During revision\nof this Letter, the crystal structure of this RdRp in complex with cofactors was made\navailable in the PDB (ID: 6M71).11 An r.m.s.d. of 0.5 \u00c5 between the\ncrystal structure and our model indicates the quality of the structure we modeled. The\nSARS-CoV-2 nsp12 (Figure 1B) and SARS-CoV nsp12\nstructures (Figure 1C) showed high similarity. The\nnsp12 protein has been reported to have an N-terminal nidovirus RdRp-associated\nnucleotidyl-transferase (NiRAN) (a.a.s 1\u2013250), and a C-terminal RdRp (a.a.s\n398\u2013932) connected by an interface domain (Figure 1A).7,12 NiRAN is\nessential for replication of SARS-CoV and other nidoviruses and can be involved in nucleic\nacid ligation, mRNA capping, and protein-primed RNA synthesis.13 However,\nthe mechanism of its nucleotidyl-transferase activity is still not completely clear. We found\nthat the NiRAN sequence of SARS-CoV-2 showed 93.2% identity with SARS-CoV. A total of 17\nsubstituted a.a.s appeared in SARS-CoV-2. However, the well-conserved a.a.s, Lys73,\nArg116, Thr123, Asp126, Asp218, and\nPhe219, were unchanged.7 Meanwhile, RdRp showed a very high\nsimilarity of 98.1% with only 10 substitutions. RdRp comprises a finger domain, a palm domain,\nand a thumb domain. The finger domain revealed two important conserved motifs named motif G\nand motif F. The palm domain forms the catalytic core of the polymerase and has four conserved\nmotifs, A to D, and part of motif E. Considering the structure of the modeled nsp12 protein,\nthe NiRAN domain may engage in a functional interaction with the palm domain as these two\ndomains are in close spatial proximity. In comparison with SARS-CoV, three substitutions were\napparent in the polymerization zone: Tyr766Phe in motif C, one\nAla772Ser, and one Ala784Ser in motif D (Figure 2A,B). The hydrogen bonds between Tyr766Phe and\nAla772Ser with other a.a.s are similar, whereas Ala784Ser provides an\nadditional hydrogen bond (3.2 \u00c5 to Tyr787) in SARS-CoV-2 when compared with\nSARS CoV. The thumb domain is essential for nucleic acid binding. SARS-CoV-2 showed 100% a.a.\nsequence identity with SARS-CoV. However, superimposition analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV\nRdRp suggests two structural modifications in the finger and thumb domains (Figure 2C). These changes are located at the start of the finger\ndomain (a.a.s 405\u2013448, colored orange and cyan, respectively) and thumb domain (a.a.s\n835\u2013895, colored pink and cyan, respectively). Because of the high a.a. sequence\nidentity, the difference appears to be minimal.",

Docking\nanalyses of three drugs that target RdRps including Galidesivir,17\nFavipiravir,18,19 and\nPenciclovir19 were performed using the program CCDC GOLD. Galidesivir\n(originally developed for hepatitis C), Penciclovir (used for the treatment of various\nherpesvirus infections), and Favipiravir (used to treat influenza in Japan) are reported to\nhave clinical significance in treating COVID patients. ATP was included as a positive control.\nThe triphosphate of all the molecules docked near the conserved catalytic center\nAsp760 and Asp761 in motif C7,12 (Figure 3 and\nSupporting Information). Analysis of docking poses revealed a significant number\nof protein\u2013ligand interactions including hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions\n(Table 2 and Supporting Information). Many of the amino acids interacting with ATP were\nobserved to establish contacts with the drug molecules. Galidesivir established four\nhydrophobic and six hydrogen bond interactions with nsp12. Favipiravir established seven\nhydrophobic and five hydrogen bond interactions. Penciclovir established five hydrophobic and\nseven hydrogen bond interactions. It was unsurprising that most of these a.a.s are located in\nthe RdRp motifs with the exceptions of Asp452 and Thr455, indicating\nthat these drugs could significantly affect the function of RdRp. Of importance is that all\nthree drugs showed a hydrophobic interaction or hydrogen bond interaction with the catalytic\ncenter Asp760 or Asp761. Arg553 was previously reported to be\nimportant in rNTP binding and positioning of template overhang.20\u221223 Multiple contacts made by\nthe three drug molecules with these amino acids indicate that they may interfere with rNTP\nbinding. Asp623, an important amino acid in sugar recognition of\nrNTP,20\u221222 was also shown to make\ncontacts with all three drug molecules. Galidesivir and Penciclovir made contacts with\nAsn691, which help in sugar selection.20,21 The drug molecules may all interfere with metal ion chelation\nas they have been shown to interact with Asp618, Asp760, and\nAsp761, which are important in metal ion chelation.20\u221224",
