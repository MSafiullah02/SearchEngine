children. These patients are vulnerable and susceptible to the environment surrounding them, yet there is little information available on indoor air quality and factors affecting it within a PICU. To address this gap in knowledge we conducted continuous indoor and outdoor airborne particle concentration measurements over a two-week period at the Royal Children's Hospital PICU in Brisbane, Australia, and we also collected 82 bioaerosol samples to test for the presence of bacterial and viral pathogens. Our results showed that both 24-hour average indoor particle mass (PM 10 ) (0.6-2.2 \u03bcg m \u2212 3 , median: 0.9 \u03bcg m \u2212 3 ) and submicrometer particle number (PN) (0.1-2.8 \u00d7 10 3 p cm \u2212 3 , median: 0.67 \u00d7 10 3 p cm \u2212 3 ) concentrations were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the outdoor concentrations (6.7-10.2 \u03bcg m \u2212 3 , median: 8.0 \u03bcg m \u2212 3 for PM 10 and 12.1-22.2 \u00d7 10 3 p cm \u2212 3 , median: 16.4 \u00d7 10 3 p cm \u2212 3 for PN). In general, we found that indoor particle concentrations in the PICU were mainly affected by indoor particle sources, with outdoor particles providing a negligible background. We identified strong indoor particle sources in the PICU, which occasionally increased indoor PN and PM 10 concentrations from 0.1 \u00d7 10 3 to 100 \u00d7 10 3 p cm \u2212 3 , and from 2 \u03bcg m \u2212 3 to 70 \u03bcg m \u2212 3 , respectively. The most substantial indoor particle sources were nebulization therapy, tracheal suction and cleaning activities. The average PM 10 and PN emission rates of nebulization therapy ranged from 1.29 to 7.41 mg min \u2212 1 and from 1.20 to 3.96 p min \u2212 1 \u00d7 10 11 , respectively. Based on multipoint measurement data, it was found that particles generated at each location could be quickly transported to other locations, even when originating from isolated single-bed rooms. The most commonly isolated bacterial genera from both primary and broth cultures were skin commensals while viruses were rarely identified. Based on the findings from the study, we developed a set of practical recommendations for PICU design, as well as for medical and cleaning staff to mitigate aerosol generation and transmission to minimize infection risk to PICU patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Maintaining high levels of indoor air quality in hospitals is important for protecting both staff and patients (Jung et al., 2015) .

A number of factors have been associated with increased risk of infection transmission among hospitalized patients. These include the increased number of airborne particles generated by activities such as suction, nebulization and cleaning especially at times when patient admissions are highest and when seasonal viruses are at their peak (Eidelman et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2014; WHO, 2014) .

The main indoor sources for particle generation identified in the PICU were nebulization therapy, tracheal suction and cleaning activities. There were also some particle sources that were not identified, due to a lack of recorded activity information. Based on multipoint measurement data, the spatial variation of particle concentration in the PICU was low because of rapid transport of particles generated across the whole area of the PICU. Surprisingly, particles generated in the isolated single room (Bed 2) were also transported to other open areas or other beds. Despite the transport of particles from the isolation room to other areas of PICU, this study showed lower bioaerosol concentrations compared with the previous research in PICU environments. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that the likelihood of bioaerosols being transported from the isolation room to other areas of the PICU is small; however, it is still an infection control risk, especially in the absence of viruses being detected in airborne particles in our study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and conclusions"}, {"text": "The multipoint measurement database obtained from this study not only improved our understanding about the transport, mixing and dilution of the particles present in the ward, but also will be useful to validate indoor particle dynamic modelling. This might be further helpful to those formulating strategies for better ventilation of hospital wards, as well as infection or air indoor air pollutant control and management.
