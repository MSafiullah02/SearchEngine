The epicenter of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak was the central Chinese city of Wuhan, from where it spread globally. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. Human to human transmission occurs through droplets, contact, and fomites. People with COVID-19 show symptoms of fever, cough, muscle aches, headache, and diarrhea. The principal feature of the severe disease is acute onset of hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral infiltrates.",

A specific RT-PCR-based test has been developed that is in use for clinical diagnoses [3]. The abundance of publications in the first three months of 2020 indicates the intensive scientific effort to address both molecular mechanisms and therapeutic routes for treating COVID-19 [4]. More than 200 clinical trials are currently underway to test novel and repurposed compounds against SARS-CoV-2 [5,6]. Certain drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and remdesivir, are being tested in clinical trials [[7], [8], [9]]. One small study reported that combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin reduced the detection of viral RNA compared to control [10,11]. A recent open-label trial with two protease inhibitors, lopinavir, and ritonavir, failed [12]. Several inactivated vaccines, viral vectored vaccines (adenovirus vector, ankara vector), nanoparticle-based vaccines, fusion-protein based vaccines, adjuvanted vaccines, recombinant protein, and DNA vaccines, as well as live-attenuated vaccines, are also being developed and tested, but these vaccines are many months away from the market [[13], [14], [15], [16]]. A phase 1 clinical trial of Moderna's mRNA-based SARS- CoV-2 candidate vaccine, mRNA-1273, has started on March 16, 2020 [[17], [18], [19]]. However, this is the first of several steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefits of the vaccine.",

To enter the host cells, the virus uses a densely glycosylated spike protein that binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with high affinity [21,22]. Structural and biochemical studies suggest that the RBD has an ultra-high binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor [23]. Few groups have designed subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2; however, their workflow involved either use of single protein for vaccine design [24,25] or used only CTL epitopes without considering the importance of B-cell or HTL epitopes [26]. Some subunit-vaccines are also in preclinical trials [27,28]. Here, we focused on designing a multi-epitope-based subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 using 33 highly antigenic epitopes. We believe that experimental evaluation may result in a novel and immunogenic vaccine that may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The complex structure of the TLR3-vaccine was initially optimized using Schr\u00f6dinger Maestro (Schr\u00f6dinger Release 2016\u20134: Maestro, Schr\u00f6dinger, New York) and subsequently used as the starting structure for MD simulations. First, hydrogen atoms were added to the complex, which was then solvated in an octahedral box of a simple point charge (SPC) water in the center at least 1.0 nm from the box edge. The system was subsequently electrostatically neutralized by the addition of appropriate counter ions. MD simulation was carried out with GROMACS 5.1.2 software package using the gromos96 54A7 force-field. A standard MD simulation protocol started with 50,000 steps of energy minimization until no notable change of energy was observed, followed by a heating step from 0 to 300 K in 200 ps (canonical ensemble) and 1000 ps at 300 K (isobaric-isothermal ensemble) by constant temperature equilibration. During this, Parrinello-Rahman barostat pressure coupling was used to avoid the impact of velocity. As a final step of the simulation, 40 ns production run was carried out at 300 K with periodic boundary conditions in the NPT ensemble with modified Berendsen temperature coupling and at a constant pressure of 1 atm. Further, the LINCS algorithm, along with the Particle\u2010mesh Ewald method, was used for the calculation of long\u2010range electrostatic forces. Fourier grid spacing and Coulomb radius were set at 0.16 and 1.4 nm, respectively, during the simulations. The van der Waals (VDW) interactions were limited to 1.4 nm, and structures were saved at every 10 ps for structural and dynamic analysis.",

Next, RMSF calculation, which gives information about the residue wise dynamics of a protein with respect to its initial position, was done. An average RMSF value of 0.39 nm was observed for the complex (Fig. 4B). Our subsequent analysis of the changes in the Rg for the vaccine-TLR3 complex during the simulation was also determined, and the average Rg was found to be 1.47 nm, demonstrating the compactness of the TLR3 receptor with vaccine subunit during the simulations (Fig. 4C). We further analyzed the hydrogen bonds that play a vital role in stabilizing protein structure and the recognition of other protein partners in a complex. The vaccine-receptor complex formed an average of 327 hydrogen bonds, suggesting the favorable intermolecular interactions between the vaccine protein and the TLR3 receptor. The formation of a large number of hydrogen bonds and its stabilization during simulations reflect the specificity and selectivity of intermolecular interactions (Fig. 4D). In total, the complex formed about 5369 bonds during the 40 ns simulation run. Next, we further computed the contact energy for the vaccine-TLR3 complex, and it was found that while the starting complex structure exhibited total contact energy of \u2212814.36 kcal mol\u22121, the stabilized complex exhibited total contact energy of \u2212935.68 kcal mol\u22121, showing the increased stability during MD simulations. Next, we performed ED analysis where PCA is one of the important techniques that provide insight into the correlation of atomic movement of protein-protein complexes, raised from the collective motion of atoms that are controlled by the secondary structure of the proteins. Typically, the largest associated eigenvalues define the essential subspace in which most of the protein dynamics occur. For this, the clusters of stable states of PCA for the TLR3-vaccine complex were visualized and analyzed. The trace value calculated from the covariance matrix of the TLR3-vaccine was found to be 2.18 nm2, suggesting that the complex exhibited compact behavior during the simulation (Supplementary Fig. 3). Lastly, the detailed interactions between TLR3 and the vaccine protein were computed from the starting structure of MD simulations and the stabilized structure of the complex extracted from MD simulated trajectory (Fig. 5\nand Table 5\n).

As a consequence, the spread can also be caused by asymptomatic carriers [[31], [32], [33]]. A positive re-test, however, may also be because the original test was false-negative, and the patient was not actually COVID-negative. Whatever may be the case, a vaccine is a better option for coronavirus management than drugs. The efforts to produce a vaccine against coronavirus are moving at a rapid pace. Two candidate vaccines are in Phase I clinical trials: i) An adenovirus type-5 vector-based vaccine, and ii) an LNP-encapsulated mRNA vaccine. Studies evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines are underway. Additionally, several vaccine candidates are under preclinical evaluation [34]. Though these trials are underway, there are known situations that vaccines have failed. Recently few groups have tried designing subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2; however, their workflow involved either use of single protein for vaccine design [24,25] or used only CTL epitopes without considering the importance of B-cell or HTL epitopes [35]. We considered all of these points while designing the vaccine. Based on extensive bioinformatics analysis, we used three proteins to design a multi-epitope subunit vaccine against novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. These proteins are nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), and the surface spike glycoprotein (S). The N protein is involved in packaging the viral genome into a helical ribonucleocapsid, and it plays a fundamental role during viral self-assembly [36]. The M protein is responsible for the assembly and immunogenicity of virus particles. The S protein mediates the entrance of the virus to human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with cell surface receptor ACE2. The S protein has two regions: S1, for host cell receptor binding; and S2, for membrane fusion. The S protein is a key target for the development of vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics for coronavirus [15,37,38]. Although the S protein is a promising immunogen for protection, optimizing antigen design is critical to ensure an optimal immune response. Our vaccine contains a suitable adjuvant, HTL, CTL, and B-cell epitopes that are joined by suitable linkers. Furthermore, the epitopes were screened for their toxicity potential. The subunit vaccine was found to be thermostable, antigenic, and non-allergenic. Molecular docking and MD simulation provided insights about the interaction, stability, and dynamics of the vaccine-receptor complex. The data suggest constructive intermolecular interactions between the vaccine protein and the TLR-3 receptor. Also, the in-silico cloning suggests the potential expression of the vaccine in a microbial expression system, thereby making it a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Upon optimization of the production process, the subunit vaccines can be rapidly tested and released in the market. They consist of only the antigenic portion of the pathogens that may directly elicit an immune response. Additionally, the vaccine does not utilize live pathogen, thus, reducing the risk of pathogenicity reversal. Hence, it can be used in immune-suppressed patients as well and elicit long-lived immunity. Computational studies suggest that our multi-epitope based subunit vaccine has a probability of showing good protective efficacy and safety against SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. We suggest the synthesis and experimental evaluation of this vaccine to determine its immunogenic potency.",
