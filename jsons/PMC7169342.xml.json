Bei der Erstuntersuchung wurde eine palpierbare abdominale Fl\u00fcssigkeitswelle, Dehydrierung und ein kleiner Riss an der linken Flanke festgestellt. Als die Katze w\u00e4hrend einer Blutabnahme sanft festgehalten wurde, riss die Haut des dorsalen Halses, was einen 15 cm x 7 cm gro\u00dfen Hautlappen hinterlie\u00df. Klinisch\u2010pathologische Abweichungen bestanden aus einer nicht\u2010regenerativen An\u00e4mie, Hypoalbumin\u00e4mie, erh\u00f6hter Globulinkonzentration und geringf\u00fcgig erh\u00f6hter Aktivit\u00e4t der Aspartat\u2010Aminotransferase und der alkalischen Phosphatase. Die Abdominalfl\u00fcssigkeit war visk\u00f6s und wies einen Totalproteingehalt von 5,3 g/dl mit 316 Zellen/\u00b5l auf, was einem modifizierten Transudat entsprach. Die zytologische Untersuchung der Abdominalfl\u00fcssigkeit zeigte 86% nichtdegenerative neutrophile Granulozyten, 13% Makrophagen, und 1% kleine Lymphozyten. Die histopathologische Evaluierung und indirekte Immunhistochemie best\u00e4tigte die Diagnose von feliner infekti\u00f6ser Peritonitis, hepatischer Lipidose und felinem Hautfragilit\u00e4tssyndrom. Das feline Hautfragilit\u00e4tssyndrom wurde bisher noch nicht im Zusammenhang mit feliner infekti\u00f6ser Peritonitis (FIP) beschrieben. Die Einbeziehung des felinen Hautfragilit\u00e4tssyndroms als klinisches Symptom im Zusammenhang mit FIP k\u00f6nnte eine Diagnose erleichtern.",
