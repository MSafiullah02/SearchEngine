The outbreak of the SARS epidemic in late 2002, for example, illustrated how rapidly crises can occur and how immediate action may be required. Negotiations on immediate and short-term issues such as SARS, and even on long-term policies not triggered by a crisis, can be made all the more complex by diverse interests, conflicting understandings of underlying facts and linkages among the multitude of issues. Specific obstacles to joint problem-solving may include disagreement on the existence, certainty or severity of the problem; on the best way to tackle the problem or the likelihood of success; or on who bears responsibility to act, who will pay costs and who will manage the response. In the health sector, national leaders in key countries may be reluctant to acknowledge the urgent need to address the spread of a disease, either because they question the facts or because they fear that taking action will have negative impacts on their international image and/or domestic political support.",

Conversely, email comments by climate scientists suggesting that they had avoided publishing data that did not support their global warming hypotheses caused a surge in attacks by climate science ''skeptics,'' who argued that climate scientists were letting their personal values bias their research.

The crosssector linkages can also lead to clashes between rival epistemic communitiesgroups of experts with a deep knowledge of an issue area, such as infectious diseases, intellectual property, the pharmaceutical industry or primary health systems. These clashes are particularly hard to address because experts from different epistemic communities do not focus on the same set of factual questions.

The stakeholders, together with mutually agreed experts, proceed through several steps. They refine the factual questions; set the terms of reference for technical or scientific studies; monitor, and possibly participate in, the study process; and review and interpret the results.

Often conveners will ask the help of a neutral party who has both process facilitation skills and technical understanding of the issues to conduct a stakeholder assessment. The assessor will seek to talk with all primary stakeholders to understand their interests and concerns overall, and to see whether and under what conditions they might be interested in participating in a joint factfinding process. The assessor may provide a report back to the convener and all the stakeholders interviewed, with an assessment of the feasibility and desirability of proceeding with joint fact-finding, and with recommendations on how to structure the JFF process.

The experiences of the Intergovernmental Working Group on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property (IGWG) and the negotiations on virus sharing underscore the benefits of developing a joint understanding of technical issues, especially as diplomats without specific scientific knowledge often lead delegations. The IGWG was established in 2006 as an intergovernmental working group open to all Member States to draw up a ''global strategy and plan of action'' that would provide a ''medium-term framework'' and would, inter alia, aim to secure ''an enhanced and sustainable basis for needs-driven, essential health research and development relevant to diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries'' (World Health Assembly 2006) . The initial negotiating session was relatively ineffective, as many of the delegations were confronted by complex issues not typically addressed by those in the public health realm. Many delegations came to the meeting without having done the necessary technical work and stakeholder consultations-the pre-negotiation preparation that would have facilitated a better outcome at this initial plenary session. A series of regional and inter-country meetings was subsequently organized to enable the national delegations to better understand the issues, dialogue with key stakeholders and develop negotiation options. When the delegations met a year later in plenary, the negotiating process was markedly improved.",

Another is the Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health, which, looked at how to move research and development funds into diseases that affect the poor.

When representing others, preparation together with constituents, colleagues and/or leaders is critical. Finally, in order to be able to develop options for mutual gain, it is equally essential to understand the interests, alternatives and bottom lines of one's negotiation partners. Good preparation has both substantive and psychological benefits. Substantively, well-prepared negotiators maximize their ability to get what they want.

As early as the TRIPS Council's first special session on access to medicines, the Africa Group, side-by-side with many other developing countries, issued a paper on its view of the relationship between TRIPS and access to medicines. It also introduced a set of limiting principles on the procedural aspects of the negotiation to follow.

One useful way to distinguish interests from positions is to state something that might be an interest, and then ask oneself: ''Why do we want that?'' ''What do we want that for?'' ''Why is that important to us?'' If the answer is a more general way to achieve the same goal, yet something that might still be negotiable, the negotiator has made progress toward more clearly defining his or her interests. For example, a negotiator might first state his or her interest as ''increasing staffing in our primary health clinics.'' After asking ''why?'' the negotiator might answer, ''to improve primary health care service delivery.'' The second statement may be a more useful framing of the interest, because there may be alternatives to increased staffing in the primary health clinics that could be equally or more effective in improving primary health service delivery. A good test of whether one is really getting to interests is whether there is more than one solution to meet the interest; if the stated ''interest'' leads to only one solution, then a negotiator should continue to ask, ''why? '' In an organizational context, negotiators should define their interests through dialogue with those whom they will be representing, be they senior managers, colleagues and/or constituents. Jointly answering the ''why'' questions should help clarify organizational goals, and may also be a good way to identify trade-offs or competing interests within the organization. However, the process of defining organizational interests in a negotiation does not end when the representative goes to the negotiation table. On the contrary, effective negotiators maintain regular communication with those they represent during the negotiation process, to summarize the status of negotiations, test possible options and trade-offs and reassess interests in light of new information and ideas.",

Developing countries rejected intellectual property rules, while the pharmaceutical industry insisted on preservation of the existing patent system in relation to development of drugs, including for ''diseases of the poor.'' Little progress was made until regional and country consultations were held, and countries began to understand the issues, their own interests and other countries' interests. While positions were rigid, interests were less opposed; developing countries were concerned about the development of drugs for diseases of the poor, while industry did not want intellectual property to be undermined in areas where the market worked. This understanding of the interests of the parties revealed possibilities for options regarding pharmaceutical development for ''diseases of the poor'' that could satisfy both sides. Part of the agreed strategy and action plan was to come with innovative financing mechanisms for diseases of the poor. Similarly, in negotiations over virus sharing that resulted in the adoption of WHA60.28 (2007), Indonesia initially refused to share samples of the H5N1 (avian flu) virus, claiming that under the Convention on Biological Diversity, access to and use of virus samples obtained in Indonesia could occur only with Indonesia's consent. Led by the United States, other countries insisted that Indonesia was obliged to share data and virus samples without preconditions, and that Indonesia was in violation of the International Health Regulations 2005. A focus on the underlying interests permitted a resolution under which Indonesia resumed sharing of the H5N1 virus. Indonesia's interests were in gaining benefits from the knowledge and technologies derived from use of the samples, while the interest of the US, WHO and others was in containing the spread of the virus, and, more generally, in preserving and strengthening the global surveillance system and the development of intervention strategies to deal with such epidemics. The WHA resolution did not resolve the legal question of whether unconditional virus sharing was required by the IHR 2005; instead, it outlined processes for agreeing to terms and conditions for sharing of viruses between the originating countries, WHO Collaborating Centres and third parties, as well as for ensuring resulting fair and equitable sharing of benefits, while directing the WHO Director General to establish an international stockpile of vaccines ''for use in countries in need in a timely manner and according to sound public-health principles, with transparent rules and procedures''. 5 The greater the uncertainty or difference of views regarding the negotiating topic, the greater the potential benefit of ''doing one's homework'' on the interests of counterpart organizations and their representatives. It is important to consider: What is their overall set of goals? What involvement have they had in this issue to date? What publicly available statements, papers, news reports or other documentation outline their views on the issue? Does anyone in one's own organization have a personal connection to the counterpart organizations, from whom the negotiator could hear some of the counterpart's perspectives on the issues? Doing some work to answer these questions will increase the potential for joint gains in the negotiation process, and will help to identify areas of potential conflict. Negotiators can use a relatively simple worksheet like the one on the next page to organize their thinking in preparation. 6 With a clear understanding of one's own interests, and good information or well-educated guesses about the interests of others, the negotiator has taken the first solid step on the road to effective preparation.

That aspiration might be very appropriate if all the health ministries in the region are willing in principle to participate, and the potential donors have signaled interest in funding such a body. If it is clear that some governments are not keen to participate, however, or that there is little donor interest, the negotiator should ask whether the aspiration is overly ambitious, and if so, reformulate it. A redefined aspiration might be to gain agreement among a core group of health ministries to pilot a self-funded surveillance system, and to seek full regional coverage and external funding after the pilot phase.",

For example, researching a pharmaceutical company's current licensing arrangements and opportunities-based on data available on the Web, from business analysts and from countries that have licensing agreements with the company-may help the negotiator form a clearer sense of the company's likely BATNA (in this case, perhaps potential licensing agreements with other countries).

The U.S. believed the new program directly violated Brazil's obligation to protect intellectual property rights under the TRIPS agreement. Brazil, on the other hand, maintained that it had the right to use all necessary means to save its population from the AIDS pandemic. Among the most effective tools used by Brazil in these negotiations was the development of a very good BATNA-providing a framework for local production of drugs, as well as supporting local manufacturers and building coalitions with other developing countries with a strong pharmaceutical sector. Brazil also worked effectively on strategies to weaken the United States' alternatives to a negotiated agreement, enhancing its bargaining power significantly. Brazil took advantage of available assets, such as international law, domestic intellectual capital and the fallback option of legally issuing compulsory licenses for AIDS drugs and having the capacity to proceed with local manufacturing in case negotiations failed (see Chap. 8).",

Value creation means inventing options that meet parties' interests wellmeaning that the options are significantly better for all negotiators than their BATNAs and ideally are closer to their aspirations than to their bottom lines. The pre-negotiation preparation steps just discussed are critical in enabling effective value creation. But they are not enough. The dynamic interaction of negotiators in a face-to-face setting has a profound effect on whether mutual gains can be realized at the table. It may generate new information, ideas, obstacles and options that no negotiator could fully anticipate during the preparation process. And if the interaction involves exchanges of positions, proposals and counterproposals, or is adversarial, value creation may be undermined, and even options that are advantageous for all parties may be rejected. It is therefore important for the negotiator to have a strategy and tools for making face-to-face negotiations as constructive as possible. The mutual gains negotiator has two particularly powerful strategies, each with a simple tool. First, clarify interests by asking and answering ''why?'' questions. Second, create and refine options for joint gain by asking ''What if?'' questions; these allow negotiators to brainstorm ideas without saying that they will necessarily agree to any of the options under discussion.

This issue almost deadlocked the negotiations several times. Developed countries recognized their historic responsibility for fossil fuel burning, but were concerned that fast-industrializing developing countries' emissions were now growing much faster than their own. Developing countries took the view that developed countries had created the problem and should take responsibility for correcting it, without constraining developing countries' industrialization paths. Skillful negotiators from developed and developing countries ultimately worked out a principle of ''common but differentiated responsibility'' for reducing the risk of climate change:",

Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof (Framework Convention on Climate Change 1992, Article 3, paragraph 1). The Convention gave shape to this principle by committing developed countries to begin reducing their emissions first, and to provide financing and technology to developing countries to enable them to reduce the rate of growth of their emissions without compromising their economic development prospects. 9 However, the principle and the general commitments laid out in the Convention did not tightly constrain the actions to be taken by developed and developing countries, allowing them latitude to work out details through further negotiation.",

Negotiators can still avoid hard bargaining among competing proposals during the value distribution phase of the negotiation by asking questions about the criteria on which the proposals are based. Particularly for negotiators from developing countries, insisting on and discussing appropriate objective criteria for choosing among options can be a powerful tool to resist coercion or pressure from more powerful negotiating counterparts. If the parties themselves cannot come up with mutually acceptable criteria, they might present their preferred outcomes to a neutral third party they trust for input and/or a decision-for example, someone from the private sector or civil society sector with experience with the issue at hand.",

            "text": "Even with a good set of options and fair criteria, disagreements about ''dividing the pie'' will still arise. One way to resolve them is to trade ''across'' issues that parties value differently. For example, imagine you are involved in a negotiation wherein you could negotiate a trade-off across two issues: a cost-sharing formula and the role of civil society in implementing a treatment program. Imagine that you care more about maximizing the role of civil society, and your counterparts care more about minimizing the cost of implementation. You might therefore accept a higher cost-share, to be borne by you or by civil society. In exchange, your counterpart might accept more civil society involvement in implementation. If a direct trade-off across issues is not possible, another way to resolve the disagreement is to make a contingent agreement. A contingent agreement is a way for participants who cannot be sure about the impact of an agreement on their interests to reduce the risk involved in the agreement, and put in place a procedure for changing it in response to future developments. For example, imagine that your counterparts are concerned that the civil society stakeholders do not have the capacity to follow through with implementation, and that because the government lacks direct control over their behavior, they might decide to implement the program in a way the government does not like. You and the government officials might agree to try a system that allows the civil society group to take a smaller role in implementation as a pilot project, for the first 6 months. After that trial period, the group as a whole will reconvene to review the progress and agree in advance that if the NGOs implementing the programme meet the agreed-upon criteria, their role would then be expanded. This contingent agreement allows the government to be assured of its interests in quality and oversight, and enables you to expand the role of civil society in the long run.",

In the Kyoto climate change negotiations, AOSIS anticipated that trade-offs would have to be made and designed its negotiation strategy accordingly. For example, the AOSIS representatives knew that there would not be consensus on their goal of a 20% reduction in emissions by 2005, but by figuring out what they could be flexible about and what had to be part of the final package, they were able to maximize the satisfaction of their interests. As a result, the final Kyoto Protocol met many of AOSIS's primary interests, and, most importantly, was legally binding and not voluntary. (The fact that almost every industrialized country was about to fail to meet its voluntary Framework Convention on Climate Change target of 1990 levels by 2000 had convinced AOSIS that voluntary commitments could not be counted on). In addition, while the final Kyoto target was lower than AOSIS sought, it might have been considerably weaker without AOSIS's advocacy of a much stronger target (see Chap. 9).",

The single-text approach involves centering deliberations on a single, jointly developed draft document, rather than discussing several draft texts at the same time. One strategy that is often effective is to ask countries that have no strong interests at stake in the negotiation, or whose interests are well-represented by other parties, to lead in drafting, allowing them to take on a quasi-mediation role. The single text may outline multiple options for each issue under discussion, placing provisions that are not yet agreed in brackets to be further discussed by the parties. The single text is critiqued-not accepted or rejected, either in part or whole-by the parties and then revised iteratively based on discussions until the draft cannot be improved further. In other words, parties make no commitments until a full package, including trade-offs, is developed. The result is a unified framework document that reflects shared understandings and agreements within the group. In addition, the side-by-side presentation of multiple options in the document allows parties to consider many issues simultaneously. This facilitates trade-offs and encourages the creative mixing and matching of options within and across issues. By compiling agreed-upon and unresolved issues into a single text in this way, the parties can more effectively monitor their progress and avoid competing proposals.",

This evolving document incorporated the various proposals for a convention into a single text that served as the basis for the negotiations.

A successful negotiation is concluded by an agreement among participants, whether unanimous among all participants, or among a substantial number of participants capable of implementing what they have agreed. Unanimity may be desirable but is not always essential for success in a negotiation process. Moreover, while parties may strive for unanimity, it is risky to make unanimity the decision rule. Unanimity rules encourage ''hold-outs.'' With a unanimity rule, one or two stakeholders who are dissatisfied with a tentative agreement are able to block it and demand large concessions as the condition for their support. Instead, it may be better to allow parties to have recourse to some form of voting, such as support by a qualified majority (e.g., two-thirds) of participants. The World Health Assembly, the governing organ of the WHO, for example, has the authority under Article 19 of the WHO Constitution to adopt conventions or agreements within the competence of the WHO by a two-thirds vote.",

The consensus required did not involve unanimity, nor an arithmetic counting of votes. Instead, it provided for a consensus that allowed the process to go on to the next stage and did not result in the breakdown of talks-effectively encouraging parties order to not block progress, are advisable. In these cases, those who are dissatisfied with a tentative agreement should be allowed to state the reasons for their dissent, and other stakeholders should seek to find creative ways to meet the concerns of the dissenters. If solutions cannot ultimately be found that satisfy all stakeholders, those who cannot agree should have an opportunity to record their outstanding concerns, and other stakeholders may want to state the reasons why those concerns were not met in the final agreement. An innovative ''opt out'' procedure was used in the International Health Regulations to address potential obstacles to global action associated with the need for ratification of treaty obligations within signatory states. While many treaties require ratification at home-in effect ''opting in''-the IHR entered into force at the time of their adoption by the World Health Assembly; WHO member states could ''opt out'' within a specific period of time if they later did not agree; rather than delay adoption of the agreement, the IHR allowed countries to opt out of certain provisions or submit reservations at a later date (World Health Organization 2005, Article 59).",

It openly aimed at encouraging the participation of actors who had been traditionally excluded from state-centric UN governance. In October 2000, the WHO held the first-ever, two-day public hearings that allowed interested groups to register their views prior to the intergovernmental negotiations. This process generated more than 500 written submissions and testimony by 144 organizations, ranging from transnational and state tobacco companies and producers to public health agencies, women's groups and academic institutions. The NGOs served a crucial educative function by organizing seminars and briefings for delegates on technical aspects pertinent to the proposed convention. They also engaged in extensive lobbying activities involving policy discussions with governments, letter-writing to delegates and heads of state, advocacy campaigns, press conferences before, during and after the meetings, and the publication of reports about tobacco industry practices and collusion in smuggling. By acting as the ''public health conscience'' during proceedings, NGOs became effective advocates of tobacco control. They exposed the obstructionist and dangerous positions certain states took. For example, some organizations called for the U.S. to withdraw from the negotiations given the role of the U.S. delegation in obstructing tobacco control efforts. Some prominent tobacco control advocates were able to promote the public health agenda in the FCTC negotiations themselves as members of national delegations. Public health NGOs and advocates could thus successfully constitute a counterweight to pressures on national delegations by the tobacco industry (Collin et al. 2002) . Similarly, during the IGWG, there were public hearings, and WHO Secretariat held a global web-based public hearing to obtain public input on the first draft from as wide a group of stakeholders as possible. Member states, national institutions, health profession organizations, NGO, academic institutions, and others submitted more than 90 contributions to the public hearings. 12",
