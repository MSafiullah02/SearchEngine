However, there is usually an osteoblastic component that is manifested by the visualisation of bone metastases on radionuclide bone scans and elevation of osteoblastic bone markers such as bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP). Although sometimes identified on imaging tests, most SREs are associated with symptoms when they are known as symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs).

Anti-resorptive agents, such as bisphosphonates or denosumab, delay SREs and are subsequently now widely established as standard therapy for such patients [3\u20136]. Additionally, bisphosphonates suppress bone turnover markers, with their normalisation or degree of suppression correlating with reduced SREs and death rate [7]. However, there remains a need for further treatment options for patients with bone metastases to improve survival more than 2\u20133 years. Combining systemic therapy with a bone-targeted agent, such as radium-223, may provide an effective treatment with minimal additional side effects.",

            "text": "Radium-223 dichloride (radium-223) is a novel alpha-emitting pharmaceutical that has been developed for the treatment of bone metastases. The product is based on the alpha-emitting radionuclide radium-223. The intrinsic bone-targeting property of radium-223 compounds is similar to that of other alkaline earth elements, like calcium. The characteristics of alpha-emitting radionuclides have benefits over beta-emitting radionuclides for bone targeting. Firstly, radium-223 emits alpha-particles with high linear-energy transfer and a radiation range limited to less than 100 \u03bcm [8\u201311]. This generates a highly localised and effective radiation zone with high probability of inducing double-strand DNA breaks in the cancer cells. LOn the other hand, beta-emitting radiopharmaceuticals, such as strontium, emit particles with lower energy, mainly inducing single-strand breaks which are more easily repaired. Additionally, beta-particles typically have 30\u201380 times longer radiation range compared to alpha-particles. An alpha-emitting radiation source located in a target tissue, such as bone metastases, will deliver higher energy radiation to a more localised volume than beta emitters, thereby reducing exposure of surrounding normal tissues and leading to less toxicity, importantly less myelotoxicity. Radium-223 received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2013 for the treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and bone metastases [12].",

Therefore, it is important to assess the toxicity and efficacy of radium-223 in a population of patients that commonly requires chemotherapy. Currently, larger randomised trials are evaluating the addition of radium-223 to an aromatase inhibitor alone or with everolimus (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02258451 and NCT02258464). The results are anticipated in 2020. Combinations with chemotherapy are also of interest for treatment later in the clinical course. Capecitabine was selected due to its frequent use as a single agent in breast cancer and relative lack of myelotoxicity. The combination may, therefore, target both bone metastases and visceral metastases.",
