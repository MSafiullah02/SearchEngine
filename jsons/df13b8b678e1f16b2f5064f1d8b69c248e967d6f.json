            "text": "However, there are healthcare activities which cannot be stopped, nor reduced by a great extent, and cardiothoracic surgery definitely is among them. Indeed, apart from diseases which require urgent/emergent surgical treatment (e.g. aortic dissection, thoracic trauma, endocarditis, intracardiac tumors, etc.), also many \"elective\" cardiothoracic procedures cannot be postponed for long, particularly valve replacement/repair in symptomatic patients, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in patients with left main coronary artery disease, and lung malignancies surgery. Accordingly, hospitals should implement strategies to perform these procedures safely in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, but also to prevent contagion among patients and healthcare personnel by newly admitted patients (as well as by healthcare workers themselves) with unapparent infection. 5 In this issue of the Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia, a Special Article by Tan and coll. 6 describes the protocols and organizational changes for the management of cardiothoracic surgery in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients at the largest adult cardiothoracic tertiary center in Singapore. The authors report a series of scrupulous measures aimed at preventing contagion among patients and healthcare workers and at avoiding contamination of environments and medical instrumentation. Key points outlined in the article include: the need for careful planning and training, also through simulation, before performing cardiothoracic surgery in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients; the challenge of minimizing the risk of admitting undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients to the cardiothoracic center; the availability of negative-pressure inpatient rooms in all hospitals and the need for negative-pressure operating theatres (as well as the expedient to keep the operating room doors closed for at least 10 minutes after tracheal intubation or extubation in order to allow high efficiency particulate air filters to remove 99% of the particulate air matter, in the absence of negative-pressure operating rooms); the use of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE); the creation of physically separate routes (including dedicated entrances and lifts) for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients; the systematic surveillance and screening of healthcare staff and visitors (the latter reduced to a minimum); and the division of staff members into separate teams in order to prevent crosscontamination among healthcare personnel if one surgical team should be accidentally exposed to a patient with unapparent SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Until recently, Italy was the country with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide. 1 As of April 15, 2020, the total number of people with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy was 165,155, with more than 21,000 casualties 11 , as compared with 3252 cases (and 10 deaths) in Singapore. 1 The two hospitals in which we work are in the frontline in the management of COVID-19 patients and, at the same time, are important reference centers for cardiothoracic surgery in the North and South of Italy, respectively. In particular, San Raffaele Hospital is the referral hub for cardiovascular urgencies/emergencies in Lombardy, the Italian region most affected by the epidemic. As shown in Table 1 , despite the reduction or suspension of ordinary hospitalizations and elective surgical activity, the number of cardiac surgical procedures at our centers remained rather significant.",

These include: the relatively long incubation time (mean 5.2 days, but up to approximately 14 days or more) 13 ; the possible person-to-person transmission from asymptomatic individuals or even in either the prodromal or convalescence phase of the disease 5 ; the suggested significant percentage of false negative results with nasal swab testing (approximately one in three) 14 ; and the high estimated number of asymptomatic infections itself.",

In addition to these measures, Tan and coll. 6 report other important measures which, in our opinion, should be shared at a nationwide (or at least regional) level, particularly the division of staff members into separate surgical teams (to avoid, as mentioned, cross-contamination among healthcare workers in case of accidental exposure to undiagnosed COVID-19 patients), the clear distinction of personnel caring for COVID-19 patients from that caring for other patients (including with regard to highly skilled teams such as those of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation services), and the need for infectious disease specialist consultation and agreement of the heads of both cardiology and cardiothoracic surgery departments before admitting any new patient. 12 9 CABG, coronary artery bypass graft ",
