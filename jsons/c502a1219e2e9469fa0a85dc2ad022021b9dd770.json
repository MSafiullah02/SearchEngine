Urine samples were collected in November 1992 (S1) and 4 months later in February 1993 (S4). A total of 246 children aged 6-12 months attending 29 daycare centers from 1 November to 28 February were screened for the excretion of CMV in urine. The diagnosis of viral acute respiratory infection was performed in the case of outbreaks only. Forty-eight (19.5%) children were both S1 and S4 positive for CMV, 30 (12.4%) became CMV positive (S1-/S4c), 4 (1.6%) became negative (S1c/S4-) and 164 (66.7%) remained negative. The percentage of children becoming CMV positive was significantly (P~0.001) higher in day-care centers where more than 40 children were enrolled. Nine outbreaks due to respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus and enterovirus were recorded in 8 of 29 (27.6%) day-care centers. Viral acute respiratory infections were significantly (P~0.05) more frequently recorded in day-care centers in which CMV and respiratory viruses cocirculated and were significantly (P~0.001) more frequently reported in CMV-infected children. These findings suggest that viral acute respiratory infections are significantly more likely to occur in CMV-infected children.",

CMV transmission from child to child [3, 4] , child to parents [3, 5, 6] and child to day-care providers [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] has been studied extensively. For example, an annual CMV infection rate of 10-20% has been reported in CMV-seronegative women working in day-care centers in the USA [8] . A similar study conducted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa (USA), has estimated the overall risk to day-care providers of contracting CMV infection from infected children attending day-care centers to be 22% and 40% for a 12and 16-month exposure period, respectively [11] . In France, a study of CMV transmission in 93 children attending six day-care centers in Val de Marne (near Paris) showed that, over a 6-month period of surveillance, 23.4% of 6-12-month-old children excreted CMV. In this study, the phylogenic analysis of the strains recovered revealed no dominant or more efficiently transmitted strain [12] .",

All recorded viral etiologies have, for a long time, been known to cause ARIs, including echovirus type 11, which has been previously demonstrated to cause pharyngitis in children over 6 months of age [26] . This is in agreement with our results, which showed that echovirus type 11-related rhinopharyngitis was observed in children over 8 months of age. Because outbreaks due to respiratory viruses were significantly more frequently found in daycare centers in which CMV and respiratory viruses cocirculated, and, since viral ARIs were significantly more frequently reported in CMV-infected children, we suggest that viral ARIs are significantly more likely to occur in CMV-infected children.",

Two hypotheses could explain the association between an incidental CMV infection and the development of viral ARI. First, CMV may induce transient immunosuppression and increase both the frequency and/or the severity of viral ARI, as has previously been observed [15, 16] . Secondly, respiratory viruses may lead to the reactivation of latent CMV. Among the 15 children with RSV infection, only one child became a CMV excretor. Since we have demonstrated that RSV-related bronchiolitis cases were significantly more frequent in children who became CMV positive, we favor the first hypothesis. Thus, CMV could act as an immunomodu-lator and promote both the transmission and pathogenicity of RSV among young children.
