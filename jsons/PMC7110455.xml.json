CIRD describes an infection of the upper respiratory tract caused by single or multiple agents (Appel, Binn, 1987, Mochizuki et al, 2008). It has been postulated that the pathogenesis of CIRD is multi-factorial, since dogs experimentally infected with a single respiratory pathogen often showed only mild clinical signs, while severe clinical disease, such as that commonly documented in natural outbreaks, could not be reproduced (Karpas et al, 1968, Appel, Percy, 1970, Bemis et al, 1977).",

Due to the highly contagious nature of the disease, dogs living in crowded conditions, such as shelters and day care centres, are especially susceptible to infection (Appel, Binn, 1987, Buonavoglia, Martella, 2007). Most dogs with CIRD recover spontaneously within days to weeks unless complicating factors occur, such as lower respiratory tract involvement or severe secondary infections (Buonavoglia and Martella, 2007). However, CIRD can become enzootic in certain environments, because of the repeated introduction of novel infectious agents into dog populations (Mochizuki et al., 2008).",

Canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine herpesvirus-1 (CHV) and Bordetella bronchiseptica are commonly reported pathogens in this disease complex (Erles et al, 2004, Buonavoglia, Martella, 2007), but recent studies have reported the involvement of new viral agents (Priestnall and Smith, 2012). Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) was first isolated in 2003 from the airways of dogs with acute respiratory signs (Erles et al., 2003) and is highly prevalent among dogs with clinical signs of respiratory disease in many different countries (Yachi, Mochizuki, 2006, Erles et al, 2004, Mochizuki et al, 2008, An et al, 2010a). In 2004, canine influenza virus (CIV) was detected in racing Greyhounds in Florida, USA, and caused severe respiratory disease (Crawford et al., 2005). To date, the virus is endemic in many states of the USA (Payungporn et al, 2008, Barrell et al, 2010, Hayward et al, 2010, Holt et al, 2010, Seiler et al, 2010, Serra et al, 2011), but so far there are no endemic areas outside the USA (Kruth et al, 2008, Knesl et al, 2009, De Benedictis et al, 2010, Piccirillo et al, 2010).",

For virus detection, a combined analysis of the nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens from each dog was performed; for detection of B. bronchiseptica, nasal and pharyngeal swabs were analysed separately. It was not possible to take pharyngeal samples from three dogs, while nasal samples could not be taken from two dogs.",

Since the time between vaccination and the onset of clinical CIRD was not documented, we could not determine if dogs developed clinical CPIV due to an insufficient immune response following vaccination or if some dogs tested positive for a vaccination strain of CPIV. It has been suggested that dogs vaccinated with a modified live CPIV vaccine could shed the virus for some time after vaccination (Ellis and Krakowka, 2012); the PCR used in the present study was unable to differentiate between vaccine and field strains of the virus. In dogs experimentally infected with CPIV, only mild clinical signs were observed in some animals and others remained subclinical (Appel and Binn, 1987). In our study, infection with CPIV was detected in seven healthy dogs. It has been postulated that most naturally acquired clinical infections with CPIV are co-infections with several pathogens (Appel and Percy, 1970). This was supported by the results of the present study, since only 4/23 (17.4%) dogs in the CIRD group had CPIV infection as a single agent, and 2/7 (28.6%) healthy CPIV positive dogs had a co-infection with B. bronchiseptica or CAV-2. It is possible that CPIV could impair the local host defence mechanisms in the canine respiratory tract, facilitating colonisation and infection with other respiratory pathogens, such as B. bronchiseptica, or vice versa (Appel and Binn, 1987).",

To our knowledge, the prevalence of CRCoV and other respiratory viruses has not previously been investigated in the German dog population. Studies performed in Italy (Decaro et al., 2007), the UK (Erles et al., 2003), Japan (Yachi and Mochizuki, 2006) and Korea (An et al., 2010b) have detected CRCoV in respiratory samples from dogs with CIRD. Additionally, antibodies against CRCoV have been detected in dog populations worldwide, including Italy (Priestnall et al., 2007), New Zealand (Knesl et al., 2009), Korea (An et al., 2010b), and the USA, Canada, the UK and Ireland (Priestnall et al., 2006). CRCoV was only detected in dogs in the CIRD group in the present study and none of the healthy dogs were identified as carriers. However, these results must be interpreted in the light of the small sample size and the fact that CRCoV was not present as a single agent in any of the infected dogs. All six dogs that tested positive for CRCoV were co-infected with B. bronchiseptica; two of these dogs also tested positive for CPIV. This is similar to findings in Korea, in which CAV-1 and CAV-2, canine parvovirus 2a and CDV were detected as co-infections in dogs with CRCoV (An et al., 2010a). When Erles et al. (2003) first detected CRCoV in respiratory tissues of shelter dogs with acute respiratory disease in the UK, they suspected that the severity of clinical signs depended on additional factors, such as co-infections. In their study, almost all dogs that were antibody negative on entry to a shelter became CRCoV antibody positive within 3 weeks, but only 50% of them developed respiratory disease. This is in contrast to our findings, in which CRCoV was not detected in any healthy dogs.",

Secondly, bacterial culture results were reported, but this method is less sensitive than PCR (Reizenstein et al., 1993). Additionally, in our study, specimens were collected from the upper respiratory tract, an area colonised by different resident bacterial species to those expected from BALF specimens in dogs with respiratory disease; the prevalence of B. bronchiseptica might have been different in our study if samples from the lower airways had been collected for analysis.",

Thus, we might have underestimated the true prevalence of this bacterium in dogs with CIRD. Although significantly more dogs with respiratory signs tested positive for B. bronchiseptica, almost half of healthy dogs (45.6%) were also identified as carriers. Since vaccination within the last 4 weeks was an exclusion criterion for the study and only one healthy dog had received an intranasal vaccination against B. bronchiseptica, the positive test results cannot be explained by recent vaccination in our study population. In a British study, B. bronchiseptica was cultured from BALF specimens in 62.8% of dogs with clinical signs of respiratory disease and from 34.6% of healthy dogs in the same shelter (Chalker et al., 2003). Thus, healthy dogs can be carriers of B. bronchiseptica and, therefore, might represent a potential source of infection for susceptible dogs.",

Based on these results, these pathogens do not seem to play a significant role in CIRD in the German dog population; however, our results must be interpreted carefully because of the relatively small sample size. In addition, the selection of dogs for inclusion in the study might have influenced these data. Since only 26.2% of dogs with CIRD and 46.6% of healthy dogs were from a shelter or kennel environment, and the rest lived in private households, it is possible that infectious agents that can be endemic in multi-dog facilities might have been underdiagnosed in this investigation. When privately owned dogs and shelter/kennel dogs were compared, there were more B. bronchiseptica positive dogs living in private households and all CRCoV positive dogs were privately owned. This indicates that CIRD is not only a problem when large numbers of dogs are housed together, as the expression \u2018kennel cough\u2019 implies, but privately owned dogs are susceptible to infection and can act as carriers.",

It would be interesting to test a larger sample of shelter dogs for respiratory pathogens in future studies and to include dogs from other regions of Germany. Another limitation of our study was the limited sampling period. Since most of the viral pathogens involved in CIRD can only be detected for 7\u201310 days after infection and peak shedding usually occurs during the incubation period (Buonavoglia and Martella, 2007), specimens from dogs tested outside this window could have yielded false negative PCR results and thus led to underestimation of pathogen prevalence. In nine dogs from the CIRD group, no pathogens were detected, perhaps because specimens were collected outside the viral shedding period, or perhaps these dogs were infected with viral or bacterial pathogens not included in the diagnostic panel used.",
