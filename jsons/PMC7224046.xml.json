The most acceptable parameter for evaluation of eligibility for weaning is performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Spontaneous breathing trial is usually associated with increased oxygen demands [5] which is sometimes not matched with equivalent increase in oxygen delivery [5]. Diversion of blood flow towards respiratory muscles during the SBT impairs oxygen delivery to other tissues [6, 7]. Impairment of various indices for peripheral tissue perfusion was found to be associated with higher risk of failed extubation [8, 9]. Hence, monitoring of perfusion indices was hypothesized to be a useful marker for early detection of failed weaning [8, 9]; however, the previously used indices are relatively invasive.",

PPI was recently used as a surrogate of the cardiac output during resuscitation of shocked patients [14]. This relation between the PPI and the cardiac output could explain the change in the PPI during the SBT. In patients with failed SBT, there is an increased oxygen demand which is not compensated with increased oxygen delivery with increased blood flow to the respiratory muscles on the expense of peripheral tissues.

Subsequently, various indices for peripheral tissue perfusion were reported to be impaired in patients with failed extubation trials such as serum lactate [8], central venous oxygen saturation [9], thenar oxygen saturation, [15], mottling score, and knee oxygen saturation [16].
