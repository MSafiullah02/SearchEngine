Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a newly emerged swine enteric virus, was first discovered in healthy pig herds by a research team in Hong Kong in 2012 after performing a molecular epidemiological investigation among 3,137 mammals and 3,519 birds (Woo et al., 2012) . Two years later, PDCoV was reported to cause severe diarrhoea and/or vomiting and atrophic enteritis in pigs in the United States and China (Song et al., 2015) .",

First, the triplex assay was established and able to specifically detect the traditional diarrhoeal pathogens TGEV, PEDV and PRV-A (Figure 2b). Next, the cDNAs and primer sets of PSaV or PKV were added to the triplex assay, and the results demonstrated that all these target genes were well amplified without any interference (Figure 2b). Based on these results, both PSaV-and PKV-related reagents were combined with a triplex reaction system, which resulted in a multiplex assay that was able to detect TGEV, PEDV, PRV-A, PSaV and PKV simultaneously(Figure 2b). The final multiplex RT-PCR was eventually developed by adding PDCoV-associated reagents into the previous multiplex assay. The results indicated that good amplification and high efficacy were obtained in this final multiplex RT-PCR assay(Figure 2b).To achieve ideal amplification conditions, the concentrations of the primer sets of each virus were optimized. The optimum final concentrations of the mixed primer sets were as follows: 0.2 pmol/\u00b5l for PKV, 0.05 pmol/\u00b5l for TGEV, 0.3 pmol/\u00b5l for PEDV, 0.8 pmol/\u00b5l for PDCoV, 1.6 pmol/\u00b5l for PRV-A and 0.2 pmol/\u00b5l for PSaV.",

The resulting cDNAs and DNAs of porcine pseudorabies virus (PrV) were used as templates to validate the specificity of the multiplex RT-PCR assay developed in this study. Primer sets specific to individual viruses were employed as positive controls enteric diseases in pigs and for the discovery and identification of novel porcine viral enteric disease complexes, there are some disadvantages, such as cost, long diagnosis times, and high requirements for instruments and analysers, limiting their usage in the field or clinical settings for diagnosis. Multiplex PCR/RT-PCR is still widely used by most veterinary diagnostic laboratories due to simple procedures, rapid diagnostic results, high-throughput methodologies, low cost and more advantages.As we mentioned earlier in this manuscript, TGEV is a widely accepted and well-characterized enteric pathogen(Pensaert & Martelli, 2016). Of the 382 faecal samples analysed, TGEV was notdetected by our multiplex RT-PCR, which was confirmed by single TGEV RT-PCR. Song et al. also did not find TGEV-positive samples from 356 samples of diarrhoeal specimens collected in Jiangxi Province between 2012 and 2015 (Song et al., 2015). However, Wang et al. reported an 18.5% positive rate of TGEV from 27 intestinal samples collected from four provinces of Northwest China between September 2015 and May 2016 (Wang, Ji, Zhang, Xu, & Zhang, 2018). The main reasons responsible for this difference might be the varied geographic distributions of this virus or different sample types. Using nanoparticle-assisted polymerase chain reaction, Zhu et al. found a 3.5% positive rate of TGEV infection in 114 samples from four provinces of China (Zhu et al., 2017). Investigations from Zhao et al. revealed that the TGEV infection rate was as low as 1.91% in East, Northeast and Southeast China between 2012 and 2014 (Zhao et al., 2016). Taken together, TGEV is not a prevalent or F I G U R E 5 Field sample detection reveals coinfections of swine enteric viruses. (a) Geographic distribution of sample collection. A total of 382 porcine diarrhoeal samples were collected from pig farms of nine provinces distributed in North, Middle and South China between October 2015 and April 2017. All clinical samples were resuspended in 5 \u00d7 volume of sterile PBS and subjected to centrifugation to remove the debris. The supernatant was used for viral RNA extraction with TRIzol reagent. Next, the total RNAs were reverse transcribed using hexamer random primers and then subjected to multiplex PCR analysis. (b) Venn diagram showing the total and proportion of positive samples for each virus. The overlapping areas indicate the total samples that were positive in 2, 3 and/or 4 different viruses by multiplex RT-PCR viruses are complicated and complex. Except for the widely accepted and well-characterized PEDV, TGEV and PRV-A, there are some more poorly characterized viruses present in swine intestines, such as sapoviruses, kobuviruses, orthoreoviruses, astroviruses, enteroviruses, circular DNA viruses, bocaviruses, picobirnaviruses, porcine sapoviruses, sapeloviruses, teschoviruses and others. Importantly, some of these viruses are always detected spontaneously from the same specimen, indicating that coinfection is a common phenomenon in some pig farms. Our results showed that dual or triple infections between PEDV, PDCoV, PRV-A, PKV and PSaV commonly existed in Chinese pig herds. Zhao et al. also reported the coinfection of PKV with PEDV, TGEV and PRV-A in China (Zhao et al., 2016). Using next-generation sequencing or nanopore sequencing technologies, Chen et al. and Theuns et al. reported that coinfections of swine enteric viruses were widely presented in pig farms in the United States and Belgium (Chen et al., 2018; Theuns et al., 2018). The coinfections of swine enteric viruses introduce two significant challenges for the prevention and control of swine viral diarrhoea. First, coinfections may speed up the evolution of individual viruses and coevolution between coinfected viruses. Meanwhile, recombination between coinfected viruses may also occur. New swine enteric coronaviruses were generated by recombination with PEDV and TGEV and spread across central Eastern European countries during 2012 and 2016 (Akimkin et al., 2016; Belsham et al., 2016; Boniotti et al., 2016). Recombination might create more virulent enteric virus strains or new viruses, leading to potential outbreaks or pandemics of swine viral diarrhoea. Additionally, coinfections may promote the evolution of non-pathogenic enteric viruses into high virulent and pathogenic viruses. A recent example showed the existence of PDCoV in pig herds for many years in mainland China and Hong Kong; however, the virus had no observable clinical symptoms(Pan et al., 2017;Woo et al., 2012).Unfortunately, this virus caused severe outbreaks in some states of the United States since 2014(Ma et al., 2015;L. Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014). This virulence change was most likely caused by previous exposure to PEDV or other coinfected swine enteric viruses.",
