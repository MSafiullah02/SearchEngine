For seasonal influenza patients, all patients admitted with a positive respiratory specimen for seasonal influenza A or B from December 2008 to May 2009 were included in the cohort. A list of patients was generated by identifying respiratory samples which were positive for influenza by immunoassay (IA), direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR).

For categorical variables, the percentages of patients in each category were calculated. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test or the chi-square test for dichotomous variables. Percentages of expected characteristics of all hospitalized patients based on published population rates [6] were compared to observed characteristics using the chi square statistic. Factors that had a significant association (p<0.05) with ICU admission were put into a full model for multiple logistic regression analyses. A backward selection method was performed for model fitting and predictors with the highest p-value were taken out from the model one at a time until achievement of the most parsimonious model. Both p-value of individual effect and Akaike Information Criterion were used to assess model fitting. All analyses for this study were performed with SAS software, version 9.2.",

Children less than 2 years of age have been reported to be at highest risk for hospitalization with seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza infections[7], [8], [9], and it has been assumed they would also be at highest risk for admission to an intensive care unit. In support of this, a recent pediatric study from Argentina, reported that children less than 4 years were at highest risk for severe disease with 2009 H1N1 influenza infection [7]. In contrast to these reports, however, our study is the first to demonstrate that older hospitalized children with H1N1 were significantly more likely to require intensive care services than hospitalized children less than 2 years of age. The age group 4\u20135 years formed the largest group with severe 2009 H1N1 infection requiring intensive care services and the median age of hospitalized children was 6 years. This is in contrast to the 2008\u20132009 seasonal influenza season, where the median patient age was 1.8 years, and the median age of patients admitted to the PICU was 2.2 years.",

One possible explanation is that younger children may have a less robust immune response to 2009 H1N1 and, therefore, not develop severe pulmonary disease which may be immune mediated. This would imply that the 2009 H1N1 virus elicits a different or more robust immune response than seasonal influenza. It is possible that the youngest children were thought to be at highest risk for severe disease and were targeted for earlier and more aggressive treatment which may have altered the course of their illness. Our study, however, does not support this hypothesis as almost 85% of children, both less than 2 years and greater than 2 years age, received oseltamivir within 24 hours of admission and there were no differences from time of onset of illness to admission between these two groups. Alternatively, in our community, the epidemic peak occurred approximately 6 weeks after the annual reopening of schools (start date for Denver public schools was August 19) which could have resulted in a larger number of older, school-aged children being exposed resulting in a larger number being infected with 2009 H1N1, some of whom developed severe infection.",

These findings support and strengthen the recommendations that this group of patients with 2009 H1N1 infection need to be aggressively targeted for immunization, prophylaxis, early recognition, and prompt treatment.",

The increased use of ICU services associated with children with 2009 H1N1 infection was also supported by a recent study in Atlanta which showed an increase in the proportion of ICU admission for children presenting to the emergency department with influenza-like illness compared with two previous influenza seasons [11].",

Additionally, there was a trend toward higher use of high frequency ventilation compared to the previous season. This is in contrast to the pediatric study from Argentina where only 17% of the ICU admissions required mechanical ventilation[7], but similar to a children's case series from Johns Hopkins in which 46% required mechanical ventilation [12]. We speculate that the high incidence of ARDS in school age children may be related to an excessive immune response mediated by cytokines to this novel strain of influenza. Further studies are needed to determine whether particular virulence factors unique to the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus strain or host response to the virus explains this high severity of pulmonary dysfunction.",

Our hospital is the only academic tertiary children's hospital in the state of Colorado and serves as a referral center for neighboring states, which might explain our higher admissions to the ICU. Second, for 2009 H1N1 there were fifty-one patients included in our study that had a positive influenza IA, but did not have enough sample left for confirmatory PCR. Therefore, we may have included a very small number of patients who had a falsely positive influenza IA test. Based on our laboratory's experience with other specimens, however, we estimate that at most we may have had 9 false positives, 3% of our total study population. Additionally, we performed a subanalysis on the patients who were only PCR positive, which did not alter any of our findings. Third, although PCR testing was implemented during the 2008\u201309 season, a lower percentage of samples had confirmatory PCR testing performed. Finally, this study looked only at hospitalized children and therefore does not reflect the full spectrum of disease caused by H1N1 as seen in the community.",

In general, hospitalized children with H1N1 who were admitted to the ICU had a severe disease course, as evidenced by the high use of oscillatory ventilation and a high incidence of ARDS. The comparison to seasonal influenza highlights the difference in age groups hospitalized with H1N1 and the increased severity of pulmonary disease. These observations identify new high risk groups of children who might benefit from increased emphasis on prevention, earlier recognition, and new treatment strategies for H1N1 infections.",
