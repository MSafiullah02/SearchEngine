A study examining concomitantly administered central-line associated bloodstream infection (CLABSIs) and VAP programs combined documented ICERs of 14,250.74 USD (20,533.24 CAD)/life-year gained and 23,277.86 USD (33,540.02 CAD)/QALY.47 Multifaceted quality improvement programs for reducing CLABSIs in ICUs have shown dominance (lower cost and higher effectiveness) in 80% of model scenarios using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.48 A proactive model infection-control program for multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms in general-surgical ICUs showed an ICER of 3,804 USD (5,320.01 CAD) per case averted of transmission of MDR organisms in one year compared with standard infection control. For a WTP threshold of 14,000 USD (19,579.43 CAD) per transmission averted, there is a 42% probability of being cost-effective, and 100% probability when WTP thresholds were 22,000 USD (30,767.68 CAD).49 These similarities suggest that adoption of probiotics for prevention of healthcare-associated infections could be cost-effective.",
