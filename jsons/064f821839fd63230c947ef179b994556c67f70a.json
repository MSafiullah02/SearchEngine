For example, product design processes, manufacturing processes, and maintenance processes across different factories and enterprises. This complex and competitive collaboration requires the underlying system architecture and platform to be flexible and extensible to support the demands of dynamic collaborations as well as advanced functionalities such as big data analytics. Both operation and condition of the production equipment are critical to the whole manufacturing process. Failures of any machine tools can easily have impact on the subsequent value-added processes of the collaboration. Predictive maintenance provides a detailed examination of the detection, location and diagnosis of faults in related machineries using various analyses. In this context, this paper explores how the FIWARE framework supports predictive maintenance. Specifically, it looks at applying a data driven approach to the Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) model for machine condition and remaining useful life to support predictive maintenance using FIWARE framework in a modular fashion.",

In order to achieve optimal maintenance decision making, a new approach should be in place to utilize multiple data sources from different data domains. Typically, production data, machine operation and function data, and sensor data are all required for the analysis (real-time, off-line) and used to build models for predicting machine condition i.e. failure, worn, etc., or inefficient process or poor product quality reducing failure times and costs [3, 5, 6] . Real-time monitoring of machine tools and equipment together with predictive models, visualization and data analysis supported by flexible predictive maintenance platform can lead to effective maintenance. This paper presents an approach for data driven predictive maintenance of machine equipment, based on real-time shop floor monitoring and enhances the collaboration between parties involved through flexible maintenance platform in the context of Industry 4.0 by applying FIWARE framework, enabling modularizing of related functions. The contributions of this work are a) design a predictive maintenance analytics platform based on FIWARE b) propose data-driven approach with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for RUL estimation, which can make full use of the sensor sequence data, and c) using the design predictive maintenance platform to present the application case.",

However, these approaches face challenges; computational complexity and storage with HMM, memory problems with RNN [17, 18] . Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM), a type of RNN, overcomes the memory problems by controlling information flow using gates (input, forget and output) [19] . Due to the nature of sequential sensor data, LSTM is suitable for data driven predictive models for machine condition and RUL. The approach for learning LSTM model in this work is presented in Fig. 2 .

To support the aspect of predictive maintenance within the Big data analytics of the process layer, the predictive models in Fig. 1 , combining data derived from the machine tool operator, manufacturer and sensors are used for developing the predictive models following the steps in Fig. 2 , and are predicting the machine condition (e.g. worn) and remaining useful life (RUL) [5, 6, 10] .",

During operation, real-time state data collected from the underlying machine is processed by comparing the key state of each maintenance item including the threshold [5] . The state and threshold of the equipment item is stored in the maintenance repository in a database. Based on the notification of machine condition and RUL, maintenance schedule can be planned, and appropriate tasks can then be decided and performed for optimal operation.",

A concrete scene of the flexible factory is shown in Fig. 3 . The processing system in the scene consists of 4 sets of equipment, which consists of an automatic stereoscopic warehouse, numbers of AGV trolleys, three robots, numbers of frames of carrier plates. Coordinate measuring machine (CMM) is responsible for the measurement. A cleaning machine and a drying machine are responsible for cleaning and drying the workpiece. Production data are typically generated by different machines equipment operation, condition, setting, etc., including CNC machine tool. Fig. 3 . Flexible manufacturing factory [5] In the context of flexible manufacturing in this case, data are collected from different machines and tools via sensor as well as other information systems like ERP, MES, etc. Also, the manufacturing industries work beyond their boundary i.e. collaborative partners, suppliers, etc., and the nature of dynamic data can be extremely frequent and highly voluminous in the context of modern factory [1, 2, 5] . Thus, it is essential to use a consistent but extensible model to allow for a flexible predictive maintenance in manufacturing. FIWARE offers a data model based on an entityattribute model, the entities are used to represent and model real world objects including virtual entities, the attributes that describe different aspects of the entity as well as supporting open standards and extensibility [15] . In this aspect, FIWARE model meets the requirements of flexible predictive maintenance platform, thus it is adopted for the application case as presented in Fig. 4 . The proposed architecture in Fig. 1 is instantiated for the application case in Fig. 3 using key components enabling Big Data Analytics within FIWARE framework in Fig. 5 with the LSTM predictive models in Sect. 3.2 and data model in Fig. 4 .",

            "text": "The proposed solution however aims to provide flexible and modular architecture using FIWARE framework in Fig. 5 . The flexibility is achieved by facilitating the ease integration of different components required for predictive maintenance. The proposed 4-layer approach, like 5-level approach [11] supports better understanding of different components/processes at different levels as well as the overall architecture. Our adoption of FIWARE framework also provides the modularity which facilitates the ease integration i.e. interoperability of different components as pluggable components. In this sense, the case's current different machines, robots, systems and other information systems like MES, ERP, Logistics, CRM, etc., can be easily integrated with the designed predictive maintenance solution, enabling effective maintenance analytics with minimal effort.",

Also, collaborative data are moved/accessed; machine base data from manufacturer, product design data from partner as well as machine status/diagnosis required to the insurer for purposes e.g. claim analysis. The application of IDS connector along with the proposed data model facilitates greater interoperability as well as greater transparency of data access due to the policy and usage controls of the IDS connector in a collaborative context. Ultimately, it will facilitate virtual factory production mode which requires a higher level of integration of data from customers, suppliers and partners across enterprises, enabling the optimization of the information flow and delivery process for smart plant information systems.",

The proposed solution currently focuses on predictive maintenance in the manner that maintenance activity can be carried out before a potential failure or a degradation of a machine/equipment is detected. On the other hand, without the process of optimal maintenance schedule plan for the existing complex machines/equipment within the production chain, it is not easy to manage effective maintenance. In this regard, optimal maintenance schedule plan considering complex systems, cost, etc., in the context of Industry 4.0, will be hugely significant for future work.",

Predictive maintenance in industry collaborations in the complex and dynamic manufacturing environment requires a concrete, extensible architecture and platform. Unlike the 5-level approach, the proposed predictive maintenance platform offers flexible and modular system with advanced capabilities to handle the requirements of Industry 4.0 and advanced analytics e.g. LSTM models (machine condition, RUL). The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated within a flexible manufacturing case. Using predictive maintenance analytics, the maintenance task can be performed in an efficient manner to avoid unnecessary downtime, to keep low cost and to provide better management of the condition and process of expensive manufacturing equipment and optimization of the whole production chain. Regarding future work, we plan to do the implementation and evaluation of the design platform including predictive models, with the described application case and further use cases across industries as well as the development of optimal predictive maintenance schedule plan considering complex systems of Industry 4.0.",
