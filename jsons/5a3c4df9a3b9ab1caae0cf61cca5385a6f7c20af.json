Even in the indoor environment, the volatile organic compounds used in building materials that cause the so-called \"sick-house syndrome\" have caused serious health problems. Also, contagious diseases such as SARS and bird influenza viruses as well as toxic molds can be easily spread through air. To address these concerns, various air cleaners have been developed and even commercialized. However, most air cleaners use activated carbon and adsorption materials in which the initial adsorptive performance is superior but slowly decreases and finally disappears. Also, unpleasant odors are inevitably caused by the desorption of these adsorptive materials. The used adsorption materials then become industrial waste, leading to greater environmental problems. For this reason, it is necessary to develop air purification systems that do not use such waste-producing adsorption methods as well as find new energy resources that are clean and safe. Photocatalytic reactions using ultraviolet light irradiation that can render toxic or odorous organic compounds harmless are considered a promising field of research in the development of new purification methods to replace conventional adsorption systems.",

The test conditions were as follows: Two air purifiers (BF-H102A) were operated for 90 min in a room of about 31.3 m 3 size. After air purification, the air in the room was collected and analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Analysis was carried out by solid phase adsorption/thermal desorption-GC/MS methods. Before air purification, a number of organic compounds were detected in the room, i.e.,acetaldehyde, methanol, toluene, styrene, a-pinene, etc. However, after operating our air purifier systems, the peaks attributed to these compounds were seen to decrease dramatically, indicating the complete oxidation of these compounds into CO 2 and H 2 O. Such field experiments could establish the actual efficiency and stability of air purifiers incorporating rectangular column-structured TiO 2 sheets for the decomposition of organic compounds outside the laboratory in the living environment. Significantly, in the photocatalytic complete oxidation reaction, the bacteria was not only deactivated but also decomposed so that the anti-bacterial properties could be retained even with constant exposure to the bacterial shells. Table 1 shows the anti-bacterial properties of a wall-hanging type air purifier incorporating the TiO 2 photocatalyst (BF-H201A) in a demonstration of a one-pass operation. A \"one-pass operation\" allows air to pass through the air purifier from the air inlet port to the outlet port only once to evaluate the direct effectiveness of the purifier on the air (Research Center for Medical Environment, Kitasato Institute). Bacteria elimination of more than 99 % was observed even under such a one-pass operation, as shown in Table 1 .
