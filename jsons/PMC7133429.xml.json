Since the 1940s, more than a dozen virus or prion agents have been isolated from MS tissue, including rabies virus, several members of the herpesvirus family and paramyxoviruses (Table 1\n; Ref. 5). More recently, there have been reports of retrovirus isolations from patients with MS6, 7, 8, 9. This is intellectually appealing, as retroviruses, such as visna virus, can cause a chronic relapsing-remitting or progressive demyelinating disease in sheep. Additionally, other viruses in this family can induce demyelination in specific hosts.",

The relationship between ERV-9 and MSRV was confirmed using the enzyme-linked oligosorbent assay (ELOSA) and sequence analysis13. To test the hypothesis that MSRV is a replication-competent HERV, probes derived from packaged extracellular mRNAs, corresponding to regions of gag, pol and env that are conserved in retroviruses, were used to screen northern blots of various tissues. Brain and lymphoid tissue were negative but placental tissue gave a positive result. The same probes were used to screen placental cDNA clones but no open reading frames (ORFs) consistent with a replication-competent retrovirus were identified.",

Although HERV-W contains regions of extensive homology with the Gag, Pol and Env retroviral proteins, substantial mutations in the gag and pol genes mean that functional proteins cannot be translated. Genomic screening indicates that HERV-W is an extensive family, but cloning the family members did not isolate ORFs containing gag, pol and env together. Analyses of the expression of HERV-W mRNA in the placenta suggest that splicing could result in transcripts corresponding to viral-sized mRNA, as well as smaller mRNAs. One of the clones studied did produce a protein that was approximately the same size as Env and had similar predicted glycosylation, but these results are not compatible with the hypothesis that MSRV is derived from a replication-competent HERV. The major conclusion of the work by Blond et al.13 is that HERV-W is a newly characterized endogenous retrovirus family, to which MSRV might also belong.",

Two of the sequences were related to ERV-9 and four to HERV-K10 and HUMMTV, the human homolog of mouse mammary tumor virus15. Brahic and Bureau14 provide evidence that MSRV shares extensive homology in the pol sequences with human genomic sequences and with RT11, one of the clones they described14 that is expressed in some MS brains but also expressed in control brain and in non-neural tissues15.",
