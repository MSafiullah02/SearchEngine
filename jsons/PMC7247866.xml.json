            "text": "The outbreak of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infections has caused worldwide concern because this disease has caused illness, including illness resulting in death and sustained person-to-person spread in many countries [1, 2]. CoVs are a large family of viruses, including the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV [3, 4], and the new virus named SARS-CoV-2 [1]. In 2012, Saudi Arabia experienced the outbreak of MERS-CoV, which is responsible for causing mild to moderate colds. Infection with MERS-CoV can lead to fatal complications. MERS-CoV is responsible for causing severe acute respiratory illness that leads to death in many cases. According to Al-Turaiki and his group [4], MERS-CoV symptoms include cough, fever, nose congestion, breath shortness and sometimes diarrhoea. Unfortunately, information on how the virus spreads and how patients are affected is limited [4]. Fifteen years after the first highly pathogenic human CoV caused the SARS-CoV outbreak, another severe acute diarrhoea syndrome-CoV devastated livestock production by causing fatal diseases in pigs. The two outbreaks began in China and were caused by CoVs of bat origin [5, 6]. On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organisation named the ensuing disease \u2018COVID-19\u2019 [1]. Chinese health officials have reported tens of thousands of cases of COVID-19 in China, with the virus reportedly spreading from person-to-person in several parts of the country. COVID-19 illnesses, where most of them are associated with travel from Wuhan, have been reported in a growing number of international locations, including the United States [1].",

            "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually changing medical practice. With the recent progress in digitised data acquisition, machine learning (ML) and computing infrastructure, AI applications are expanding into areas that are previously believed to be only the area of human experts [7]. Various types of data mining methods have been applied by a few researchers with real CoV datasets (e.g. MERS-CoV) based on several types of ML classifiers [8]. Providing prediction systems that can accurately anticipate and diagnose such virus remains challenging. The growth of AI-driven techniques to identify epidemiologic risks in advance will be the key to improving the prediction, prevention and detection of future global health risks [9]. The main contributions of this study are the exploration of the CoV family by reviewing articles on data mining and ML algorithms, the acquisition of a clear understanding of its enhancements, and how previous research has addressed prediction, regression, and classification methods. This study also aims to collect various information from the literature that are relevant to ML, such as application nature, the use of ML and data mining algorithms, and evaluation methods and accuracy. The datasets utilised in the literature are constructed and presented with URL sources. The motivations, challenges, and limitations of this approach are examined, and recommendations on improving the approach efficiency are provided. Other important information collected, especially on the types of case study used, features and classes for CoV, are explained in separate tables. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. The second section describes the research methods used in the selected literature. The third section presents the literature review. The fourth section discusses the results, motivations, challenges, recommendations and limitations, case study used, and features and classes of CoV. The fifth section provides a conclusion.",

In this review, we aimed to obtain a large number and extensive contributions of published articles regarding the utilisation of AI for the detection and clinical diagnosis of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. However, the lack of studies on the recent outbreak of COVID-19 indicates the need and opportunity to apply AI for predicting such outbreaks. ML technique based on supervised and unsupervised learning provides the opportunity to develop a medical diagnosis system. In supervised learning, the target class of each sample in the dataset, where MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV classes are previously identified and the developed system can be adapted to a new disease. Although MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have similarity within the same cluster, they are dissimilar to the objects in other clusters. Thus, the clustering technique based on unsupervised learning is considered an efficient method to cluster the collected datasets, as presented in Table 3. Consequently, detection and diagnosis can be remarkably enhanced. All studies in this review reported the use of AI techniques, such as case-based reasoning and rule-based systems. However, none of the studies utilised other classification methods, such as neural networks, reinforcement learning and hybrid classification. None of the studies utilised and integrated optimisation techniques, such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimisation, to their systems. Data mining and ML algorithms used in diagnostic operations primarily rely on classification algorithms, including decision tree, SVM and Naive Bayes classifiers (Figure 2 and Table 2). Notably, no study in the literature exploited clustering algorithms for the detection and diagnosis of the CoV family. This technique can be used as a pre-processing step before feeding data into the classification model to gain valuable insights into the case study data by understanding which groups of disease symptoms fall into when applying these algorithms.",

Data mining for medical diagnosis systems is efficient and can be utilised to control the spread of MERS-CoV and protect humans [8].

ML technique can be used to identify and predict the dominant factors affecting the recovery from MERS-CoV [12, 13]. Thus, studies conducted on identifying the best model can help minimise the effects of epidemic diseases [11]. The distinction between SARS and MERS viruses can be considered a challenging task because of the similarities in their symptoms, such as breathing problems and high fever [15]. Medical diagnosis systems play a significant role in identifying patient health conditions with MERS-CoV symptoms [14].

Accordingly, several studies have been conducted to develop an intelligent medical diagnosis system using AI technique to control the effects of this virus. However, numerous challenges and research limitations have been indicated in the academic literature and need to be addressed in the future [8]. Some of these challenges are related to MERS-CoV nature and behaviour because understanding how the virus spreads and how people can be infected caused by the complexity of this epidemic disease is extremely difficult. The lack of a large dataset in the academic literature for MERS-CoV is considered a challenging task for AI researchers because it hinders the understanding of viral patterns and features [4, 12]. The demand to construct a dataset that can be understood by ML algorithms has increased because the current dataset involves infographic data [11]. Other challenges are correlated with people and government responses to MERS-CoV that requires more new monitoring approaches and additional efforts compared with the traditional approach for controlling epidemic diseases [13]. Another challenge with MERS-CoV is the large variation in symptoms that are mostly similar to common cold symptoms, with many other variations of diseases that may occur in cases but not in others. Some patients have unique symptoms, and others have no symptoms at all. Activists have generated huge and complex volumes of data that render its analysis impractical and difficult to predict using linear classifiers [14, 15]. The protection of citizens by the government and health agencies is a significant challenge because no specific vaccine exists for this virus to date and requesting people to undergo medical checkups is difficult [16].",

Studies, such as [8], suggested a pre-processing method to solve the missing-value problem that directly impacts the classification accuracy for the MERS virus. They also suggested the use of an ensemble technique by combining the cosine method with k-NN ML algorithm to improve the classification accuracy to >50%. Another study [4] recommended increasing the number of samples for the CoV dataset and collecting data from patients within the same geographical area by directly communicating with dedicated hospitals and health agencies [13]. [11] proposed the use of SVM classifier for the binary class problem and conducted an empirical study for multiclass problems in MERS-CoV. [17] recommended the use of the R language because of its efficiency and high functionality in supporting AI algorithms that can enable the development of an effective intelligent medical diagnosis system for CoV. Another study [14] indicated the special medical issues related to the female status, such as whether she is pregnant, which need to be considered in the treatment of CoV-infected patients [15]. [16] suggested the utilisation of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for developing a highly dependable medical diagnosis system for COVID-19.",

Four studies provided real datasets for patients affected by CoV [4, 8, 11, 12], and most datasets in other studies are published and redistributed by the Ministry of Health website of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In analysis datasets, standardisation is intended to increase the consistency of review and assessment analysis for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. An organised collection of data is found in four studies for the two viruses. In [13], the massive media outlet data were collected during the nationwide outbreak of MERS-CoV in Korea in 2015. In [14], MERS-CoV cases were recorded from several medical analytical papers focused on the early symptoms of this virus. In [15], spike glycol protein sequence data of SARS (DQ412574.1) and MERS (KP236092.1) were obtained.

In this context, the new epidemic of COVID-19 depends on the same features and classes of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Thus, extensive research has been conducted to prove a new AI pathway. As proof for the above discussion, several reliable reports and government news have mentioned that age is the most important feature of patients with COVID-19. Patients over the age of 50 are susceptible to contract the disease and be exposed to its risks and complications. The gender and city of an infected patient are the next concerns. The medical team has reported that SOB is the most important symptom attribute because it carries a high specificity for COVID-19.",

State-of-the-art CoV prediction algorithms were presented. Distinct information, such as application nature, ML used, the evaluation conducted for each study, and extracted features and classes with accuracy percentages for the utilised ML algorithms were indicated. A set of propositions for the risk recovery of this virus was established to serve as a guide for future research in the context of data mining algorithms. Despite the increasing rates of death and the number of people affected with CoV, developments based on ML algorithms to improve CoV datasets remain at a redefinition stage, especially for COVID-19. The shortage of studies in the literature is a real concern and may have serious implications for detecting and minimising the spread of this virus. An emerging, rapidly evolving situation for the virus must be considered in the viewpoint of AI applications, and researchers should provide updated contributions because they are necessary. Supportive information, such as new datasets, must be provided, and many complex features and classes must be added. Close cooperation among researchers in the biomedical engineering field and the medical community is necessary to stop the growing public health threat posed by the 2019 CoV. The goal is to conduct new studies that can guide governments and communities in the early control of the impact of this virus by utilising the features and classes collected in the literature. The need for integrated sensor technologies specifically for outdoor scenarios is highly recommended. This process is only possible when the technique is interlinked with IoT technologies, focusing on evaluating and improving ML algorithms for CoV datasets with increased efficiency. In this context, AI software developers in healthcare can develop different software packages to remotely help analyse the extracted features and classes for patients with COVID-19.",
