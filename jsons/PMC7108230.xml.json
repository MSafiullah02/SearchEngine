By the acid-amine complexation mechanism, PIDAA acid is expected to be proficient in triggering the polymerization of carboxylic acid monomers [7,8]. The tertiary aryl amine structure of PIDAA makes it a prospective photochemical and chemical polymerization accelerator. By employing a diazotation reaction phenyl-iminodiacetic acid groups were covalently grafted onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes and it behaved as a valuable solid-phase extraction [9]. In addition, it is also used for Serve Acute Respiratory Syndrome Treatment (SARS). SARS is a viral respiratory disease caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which leads to upper-respiratory tract illnesses [10,11]. Theoretically, it was found that PIDAA docks itself to the crystal structure of human Angiotensin converting enzyme 4APH [12] and behaves as a possible treatment for SARS. Organic molecules that have the ability to act as pharmaceutical drugs can be analyzed for their relationship between structural and biological parameters. This can be devised by correlating the biological activity of the selected compounds with computable physiochemical parameters [13].",

For calculations of bond dissociation energies for hydrogen abstraction (H-BDE), a 6-311G(d,p) basis set was used. MD simulations have been performed by using the OPLS3 force field [32,[38], [39], [40]]. Simulation time was set to 10 ns, temperature to 300 K, the pressure to 1.0325 bar and cut-off radius to 12 \u00c5. The modeling of MD systems was performed by placing the one molecule of PIDAA to the simulation box with around 3000 water molecules. The system was considered as isothermal\u2013isobaric (NPT) ensemble, while the simple point charge (SPC) model [35] was used for the treatment of solvent. Maestro program was used for calculations of drug likeness parameters. Drug likeness parameters have been calculated for PIDAA, in order to evaluate its pharmaceutical potential. Frequently used drug likeness parameters in this study encompassed: number of rotatable bonds, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (HBD and HBA, respectively), AlogP, polar surface area (PSA) and molar refractivity.",

MEP surface indicates the abundance or the excess of electrons at certain molecular sites, while ALIE surface indicates molecular sites where electrons require the lowest amount of energy to be removed. ALIE is defined as the sum of orbital energies weighted by the orbital densities [54,61] and according to its interpretation, it is a better descriptor than MEP, when it comes to the identification molecular sites sensitive towards the electrophilic attacks. MEP and ALIE surfaces of PIDAA have been presented in Fig. 3\n. MEP and ALIE surfaces identify two different regions as possibly sensitive towards the electrophilic attacks. MEP surface recognizes oxygen atoms (double bonded to carbon atoms) as molecular sites with the lowest MEP values, and therefore as sensitive towards the electrophilic attacks. On the other side, ALIE surface recognizes nitrogen atom and benzene ring carbon atoms as molecular sites where the electrons are least tightly bonded, indicating the sensitivity of these locations to electrophilic attacks as well.

The polarizability component, \u03b1xx has a greater influence on the static polarizabilities. \u03b1 and \u03b2 varied depending on the type of DFT methods. Urea is frequently used as a threshold value for comparative studies since it is a prototypical molecule used in the study of the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of molecular systems [63]. The first order hyperpolarisability total value for the title molecule calculated is 3.140 \u00d7 10\u221230 esu which is about 3.5 times greater than that of urea (0.92793 \u00d7 10\u221230 esu). This large hyperpolarisability value of the title molecule indicates that it has considerable NLO properties. The \u03c0-electron cloud movement from donor to acceptor might be responsible for the molecule to be highly polarized and thus makes the intra- molecular charge transfer possible.

The absorption spectra of PIDAA in DMSO solution are slightly red shifted when compared to the spectrum in distilled water (308, 311 and 313 nm), indicating relatively strong guest\u2013host interaction between the title molecule and the DMSO environment resulting in spectral shifts.

In addition to the wavelength of absorbance of DMSO to be coinciding with the title molecule's UV range, the presence of sulphur with a double bonded oxygen brings alteration in the spectra. The solvent polarity and dipole increased, resulting in the polarity of the solute to increase. It also caused the maximum wavelength red shift and decreased the absorbance as observed at 321 nm. The result showed that \u03c0 bonding orbital structure jumped into antibonding \u03c0* orbital. The band gap obtained in the presence of DMSO and distilled water ranged between 3.865\u20133.928 eV and 3.964\u20134.028 eV respectively.

It is noted theoretically that PIDAA has no absorption in the entire visible region and low energy band gap which is an essential feature for the frequency doubling process in solid state lasers [64]. The calculated band at 320.577 nm in the theoretical spectrum corresponds to the transition of HOMO to LUMO (97%). The second dominant band observed at 298.223 nm in the theoretical spectrum corresponds to the transition of HOMO to LUMO+1 (90%).

The distributions and energy levels of the HOMO\u20132, HOMO\u20131, HOMO, LUMO, LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 orbitals computed at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level for the title compound are represented in Fig. 5\n.

HOMO\u20131 is delocalized over the carbon atoms of phenyl ring with lesser influence and LUMO+1 is localized on the phenyl ring as well as over the nitrogen atom. HOMO\u20132 is delocalized over the carbonyl group and LUMO+2 is localized on the phenyl ring and the nitrogen atom with slight influence over the carbonyl group. Due to the strong electron-acceptor ability of the electron-acceptor group, the LUMO has higher stability leading to low HOMO\u2013LUMO band gap. The calculated energy values are presented in Table 6\nwhich reveals the chemical reactivity of title compound and proves the occurrence of eventual charge transfer within the molecule. The molecule is not very hard owing to the chemical hardness (2.375) with strong energy transformation [65]. The toxicity of the title molecule is substantially low due to low softness value (0.210). Electrophilicity index is one of the crucial Conceptual Density Functional Theory (CDFT) based descriptor used to study bio-activities [66]. The sufficiently high value of the electrophilicity index (2.294) acts as a precursor to analyzing the title molecule for its biological activity in terms of molecular docking where the title compound PIDAA is the ligand and is docked to a suitable protein.",

The Multiwfn [[67], [68], [69]] program has been employed to reconnoiter the charge transfer (CT) due to the first excitation by examining electron density variation [70]. In addition, the calculation of \u0394r index [71] is a quantitative indicator of electron excitation mode. The initial calculations show that the excitation mode 1, 2 and 3 possess a strong probability to exhibit Charge Transfer excitation or Rydberg character since the values of \u0394r are >2.0 \u00c5. However final conclusions can be made only after the visualization of the electron and hole distribution. On visualization, it was observed that the result generated by the medium quality grid for the integral of the hole (0.9700), electron (0.9697) and transition density (\u22480) lie in concurrence with the ideal values. The distance between the centroid of hole and electron is a measure of CT length. The considerably small value indicates the shorter length for the charge transfers. The RMSD of hole distribution that provides an insight into the distribution breadth shows it is much broader in X direction in comparison to the Y and Z direction. The t index that measures the extent of separation between the hole and electron in the title compound shows negative values along the X, Y and Z direction. The distribution of hole, electron and both simultaneously are shown in Fig. 6\n(at default isovalue 0.002). It can be observed that there is a spatial separation between the hole-electron distribution thus indicating charge transfer. From the output, we can see that the integral of overlap of hole-electron distribution (S) is 0.2907 for transition mode 1 which is greater when compared to transition mode 3 (0.1288). The distance between the centroid of hole and electron (D) for mode 3 (2.3487 \u00c5) which is larger when compared to that of mode 1 (0.9981 \u00c5).

In the IR spectrum, a broad intense band observed at 3423 cm\u22121, is assigned to OH stretching vibration, and its intensity is less than that of free OH vibration due to the existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Theoretically, the stretching vibrations are observed at 3611(O15-H26) and 3603 (O11-H23) cm\u22121. The in-plane OH deformations appear in the region 1440\u20131260 cm\u22121 [74]. A medium band at 1313 and a strong band at 1073 cm\u22121 in IR is assigned to the in-plane bending vibration of OH group. This pure mode shows 100% PED contribution. In general, the aromatic CH stretching bands commonly exhibit multiple peaks in the spectral range of 3100\u20133000 cm\u22121 [75] with strong Raman intensity. There is a possibility for the absence of Raman bands in certain expected regions in the experimental spectra due to high levels of polarization in this domain. The title compound has five C\u2014H moieties of the benzene ring in addition to two isolated CH bonds. The expected C\u2014H stretching vibrations correspond to mode numbers from 62 to 70. The calculated frequencies of the C\u2014H stretching vibrations 3070, 3062, 3054, 3042, 3035, 2996, 2969, 2952 and 2880 cm\u22121 show very good agreement with experimental data 3095, 3017, 2924 and 2837 cm\u22121 in the IR spectrum as weak bands. The PED of these C\u2014H stretching vibrations is almost pure.",

CH in-plane bending vibrations of the present compound is found at 1469 and 1136 cm\u22121 theoretically and experimentally between 1446 and 1189 cm\u22121 of the FT-IR spectrum while between 1507 and 1227 cm\u22121 of the FT-Raman spectrum. The interference of the in and out-of-plane bending vibrations of other functional groups such as CC and CN with low PED percentages leads to the slight overestimation in this region. The CO stretching vibrations have a strong absorption band which is expected in the region of 1850\u20131550 cm\u22121 [77]. The frequency of the stretching vibration is decreased due to the localization of p electron conjugation thus leading to a decrease in the double bond character of the CO group. In the molecule, a comparatively medium strength band in FT-Raman spectrum at 1886 and 1680 cm\u22121 was assigned to CO stretching vibration. Theoretically, vibrations are observed at 1750 and 1741 cm\u22121 with significant PED contribution. The medium peak observed in the Raman spectrum is due to p electron releasing effect in the CO that causes a change in the polarizability during vibrational motion.",

The skeletal CC vibrations are not disturbed by the substitutional groups.

It was observed that high value occurs between the carbon atoms in the phenyl ring while the values are higher between the boundary carbon atoms in the ring with the hydrogen atom. This is because of the overlap of the sp. orbital of carbon with the s orbital of the hydrogen which is electronically more stable. By examining the value of the carbon and nitrogen atom (C2-N1) the bonding is considerably weaker with the lowest value between N1-C9. This observation can be substantiated from the NBO output where the stabilization energy between the nitrogen and carbon atoms is low. Furthermore, an n-\u03c3* anomeric effect is expected between the lone pair on the carbonyl oxygen atom [89]. This leads to a deformation of the ELF distribution around the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group as observed in Fig. 9\n. By examining ELF values of oxygen along the carboxylic acid group, values were lower (represented by blue). The electrons in the bonds between the carbon\u2011carbon atoms showed localization (represented by red region) in comparison to the electrons in the bonds between carbon\u2011hydrogen (represented by green region).",

The parameter indicating lipophilicity/hydrophobicity, the AlogP, in case of the PIDAA is equal to 0.904, which is much lower than the values defined by Congreeve et al. [97], according to which logP values should be lower than 3. AlogP value of PIDAA indicates that this molecule might be considered as a lead drug candidate. HBD and HBA should be <5 and 10, respectively, and these conditions are also fulfilled in case of PIDAA. The number of rotatable bonds is also within the desired range. PSA should be lower than 140 \u00c52, while molar refractivity according to Ghose et al. [98] should take values in the range between 40 and 130. Conditions for both PSA and molar refractivity are satisfied, further emphasizing the pharmaceutical potential of PIDAA.",

The low softness value of the title molecule, with value almost equal to that of Oseltamivir suggests the non-toxic nature while the comparable electrophilicity index with the other drugs (greater than Oseltamivir and Lopinavir) shows the biological activity.

Hyperconjugative interactions in NBO analysis support intramolecular nature of hydrogen bonding and charge transfer interactions where the electron donating from LP(2)O15 \u2192 \u03c0* (C12-O14) showed a maximum stabilization of 48.65 kJ/mol. The polar (\u03b8) and azimuthal (\u0278) angles of the vector from the nucleus along with the deviation angle were used to specify the direction of a hybrid. The atomic charge calculations of the PIDAA showed O10 atom has the highest value of \u22120.269 e which is mainly due to the polar nature of the carbonyl group. Solid state UV spectroscopic analysis indicated \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* and n \u2192 \u03c0* transitions of PIDAA with an energy gap of 4.536 eV in the third excited state. The chemical hardness (2.375) specified compound stability, low chemical softness (0.210) signified non-toxicity while the electrophilicity index (2.294) was a descriptor of biological activeness of PIDAA. The molecular structure of PIDAA was ascertained by using FT-IR and FT- Raman spectroscopic studies and vibrational assignments were analyzed. ELF studies showed the stronger chemical bonding between CH bonds due to the overlap of the sp. orbital of carbon with the s orbital of the hydrogen which is electronically more stable. MEP surface identifies oxygen atoms to be sensitive towards the electrophilic attacks, while ALIE surface identifies nitrogen atom and carbon atoms of the benzene ring to be sensitive towards the electrophilic attacks. DFT calculations indicate sensitivity towards the autoxidation mechanism, since H-BDE values of 6 hydrogen atom are having values lower than 85 kcal/mol. Maltose as the excipient can improve the bioactivity of the drug. The pharmaceutical potential of PIDAA is also indicated by the representative values of drug likeness parameters. The low stabilization energy as observed from the NBO results between the carbon nitrogen bonds was reflected as comparatively low values in the LOL figure and a distortion between the N1-C9 atoms. The biological activity of the molecule in terms of molecular docking has been analyzed theoretically for the treatment of SARS and minimum binding energy of \u22126.66 kcal/mol calculated.",
