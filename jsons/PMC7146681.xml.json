Many hospitals, and the American College of Surgeons, are recommending cancellation of elective surgeries [1]. The term elective in this setting is inherently vague and open to interpretation. As a result, urologists and hospitals throughout the world will have to make their own difficult decisions about which surgeries should continue under the current circumstances. While hospital systems and/or governments may request that \u201celective procedures\u201d be delayed until the strain on the hospital system from COVID-19 has decreased, the characteristics of an \u201celective\u201d procedure in urology are context-dependent and have not been well defined in the current crisis.",

The choice of urgent or emergent surgeries that should still occur will depend on capacity and demand, but must also be counterbalanced by the effects of delaying surgery. This is particularly true for patients with urological cancers and complicated stones. Urologists can help by decreasing the demand for ventilators, personal protective equipment, and other critical hospital and human resources by minimizing surgeries without compromising patient outcomes whenever possible. As a community, we must also weigh the impact of nonsurgical therapies such as systemic chemotherapy that can leave patients at greater risk of contracting and potentially succumbing to COVID-19.",

These recommendations, which can be applied in the current and any future situation in which ventilators and other operating room resources are scarce, prioritize moving forward with cases where evidence suggests that even short-term delays may affect patient survival. We also suggest alternatives for the management of common urgent or emergent urologic procedures that may spare the use of ventilators, and consider the use and impact of common urologic treatments on patients during an infectious outbreak. Finally, while we do not incorporate patient age and frailty into these recommendations, the risk of a postoperative COVID-19 infection and its potential impact on a patient\u2019s postoperative course should also be considered.",
