Aliquots containing 4 \u00d7 105 PFU ml\u2212 1 were stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C and used in all experiments. Spf-grade female A/J and BALB/c mice (6 to 8 weeks of age) were purchased from the Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Biom\u00e9dicas, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, and maintained in a laminar-flow rack in microisolator cages. Mice were infected ip with 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 103 PFU of MHV-3; control animals were injected with 0.2 ml of sterile PBS alone. Mice were immunized ip with 103 PFU of MHV-A59 [34] in a volume of 0.2 ml and challenged with 103 PFU of MHV-3, 2 weeks later. The determination of serum antibodies to MHV-3 was performed by serially diluting mice sera with 2 vol of MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. A 0.2-ml sample of each dilution was mixed with the same volume of 200 PFU of MHV-3 in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min. Then, neutralizing antibodies were determined and expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution producing 100% inhibition of the cytopathic effect induced by MHV-3 on L929 cells [35].",

The titers of neutralizing antibodies against MHV-3 in the sera of the animals were determined as previously described [35], and no neutralizing activity was detected in the sera of nonimmunized mice. In contrast, sera from immunized mice of both strains (BALB/ci and A/Ji) were found to contain neutralizing antibodies at a titer of 1/512 2 weeks postvaccination (MHV-A59 inoculation). This titer of neutralizing antibodies was enough to inhibit virus multiplication in the liver of immunized mice of both strains (Fig. 4) that became fully resistant to the infection and displayed no mortality up to 30 days after (Fig. 1\nA). These animals were also resistant to a second challenge with 103 PFU of MHV-3 10 days after the first experimental infection. In this case, the survival rate was 100 and 90% for A/Ji (n\n = 10) and BALB/ci (n\n = 10), respectively. The animals were monitored for 35 days after the second challenge and showed no clinical sign of disease up to 7\u201310 days after the second challenge (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the survival time of nonimmunized mice (BALB/c and A/J) varied with strain, i.e., 100% of BALB/c mice died at 72 to 96 hpi (mean survival time: 84 hpi), whereas A/J mice died between 96 and 144 hpi (mean survival time: 120 hpi) (Fig. 1A). The different survival rates of the strains of nonimmunized mice and the resistance developed after immunization by both mouse strains confirmed that genetic and immune factors play a role in the development of resistance against MHV-3 infection.",

The EPR signal detected in blood is due to hemoglobin\u2013nitrosyl complexes (at around 10 \u00b1 2 \u03bcM levels), whereas that in liver is probably due to cytochrome P450\u2013nitrosyl complexes [40] because the organ was extensively perfused to minimize blood contamination.

Thus, in the case of BALB/c mice, virus titers in the liver increased gradually to a peak of 3.2 \u00d7 103 PFU ml\u2212 1 at 72 hpi (Fig. 4\n), when most mice died of acute hepatitis (Fig. 1A). In the case of A/J mice, virus titers were lower, a maximum of 1.1 \u00d7 103 PFU ml\u2212 1 at 72 hpi. Thereafter, virus titers decreased substantially (88 PFU ml\u2212 1 at 96 hpi) (Fig. 4) but, even so, the animals started dying (Fig. 1A). Virus titer variation during the course of the disease paralleled liver damage as assessed by histology (Fig. 5\n) and by measurements of plasma ALT activity (Fig. 6\n). No abnormalities were found in livers from uninfected A/J (Fig. 5A) and BALB/c mice (Fig. 5B) but the two strains developed a different pattern of lesions when infected. At 24 hpi, A/J mouse livers appeared unaltered (Fig. 5D), whereas BALB/c livers presented a discrete degeneration of hepatocyte cytoplasm (Fig. 5C). At 48 hpi, discrete cytoplasm degeneration occurred in A/J mice but numerous foci of inflammatory cells and necrotic lesions were evident in the liver of BALB/c mice (Fig. 5F). At 72 hpi, cytoplasm degeneration was observed for both strains (Figs. 5G and 5H) but it was strikingly more intense in the liver of BALB/c animals, which showed extensive necrosis and high amounts of polymorphonuclear cell infiltrates (Fig. 5H). These observations were consistent with those reported by other investigators for inbred laboratory mice [41], [42].",

            "text": "The results obtained with spf nonimmunized mice were less clear because even the mouse strain that synthesized nitric oxide, A/J (Fig. 2, Fig. 3), succumbed to the disease (Fig. 1, Fig. 4). However, nitric oxide synthesis occurred at a late time and although not sufficient to fully protect the host, it decreased viral load (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4) and extended liver integrity (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) and survival (Fig. 1) of the A/J strain. These results suggest that, to be efficient, nitric oxide synthesis should occur before viral load becomes too high. In agreement, it was previously reported that an early nitric oxide synthesis is required for the control of murine infection by the protozoon Leishmania amazonensis\n[36], [37]. Also, previous studies have associated an early and strong iNOS expression with genetic and acquired resistance after vaccination against Marek disease herpesvirus in chicken [28]. Moreover, our results confirm previous suggestions that a specific humoral immune response, albeit important, is not enough to neutralize virus infections [43], [44], [45]. Because it has been shown that development of resistance to MHV-3 infection in mice is not exclusively dependent on antibodies or T cells [9], our results suggest that nitric oxide may be the additional protective factor against MHV-3 infection. In agreement, treatment of the resistance-immunized mice with a specific iNOS inhibitor resulted in loss of the resistance of immunized\u2013challenged mice (Fig. 1C). Thus, an early and sustained nitric oxide synthesis resulting from immunization and infection is essential for the vaccination-acquired resistance to murine hepatitis virus by spf mice.",

Nitric oxide can function as an anti- or proapoptotic signal, depending on the biological milieu [46], [47], [48]. Therefore, one possibility to consider is that extended nitric oxide synthesis triggers apoptosis, limiting virus replication and liver injury. In agreement, previous studies have demonstrated that induction of apoptosis in resistant mouse macrophages limited virus replication and hepatic injury during MHV-3 infection [13]. These authors suggested that programmed cell death may represent a mechanism for eliminating cells expressing a host gene that is potentially harmful to host survival, such as the fgl2 prothrombinase gene, which is responsible for fibrin deposition and hepatic necrosis [14]. Alternatively, nitric oxide may be acting through an antiapoptotic mechanism by preserving hepatocytes [49] while affecting virus replication through the inhibition of enzymes essential for its survival. Among them, ribonucleotide reductase [21], ornithine decarboxylase [50], S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase [51], and cysteine proteases [13], [52] have been shown to be inhibited by nitric oxide. Enzyme inhibition is frequently attributed to nitrosation of crucial cysteine residues, a process that requires nitric oxide metabolites such as nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen trioxide [53], [54], [55], [56]. Further studies will be required to clarify the mechanisms by which nitric oxide limits virus replication and liver injury.",
