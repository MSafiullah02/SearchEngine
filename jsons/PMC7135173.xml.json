Bukreyev and colleagues only report challenging the monkeys with SARS-CoV at 28 days after immunisation. Whilst the immunisation gave excellent protection from viral shedding at 28 days, the serum concentration of antibody in immunised animals was not greater at 28 days post-challenge than that measured in non-immunised animals. Further studies examining which mucosal immune responses are induced to SARS-CoV and which of these have any role in immune protection need to be done. Dose-response studies for both immunisation and challenge will also be needed before this model can be adopted for human trials.",

They found that prophylactic treatment of infected animals with a human monoclonal antibody (directed against the cell-surface spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV) abrogated viral shedding from the pharynx, and prevented the development of macroscopic lung disease in infected animals. Extrapolation to human beings of a prophylactic treatment that reduced viral shedding and lung lesions would probably reduce transmission and the high morbidity associated with the disease.",
