According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a pandemic is considered to have begun once a disease not encountered before in a population emerges and once the agent of the disease spreads easily and constantly among people and causes a virulent disease [2]. The fact that a disease is prevalent and leads to the loss of a large number of people does not make it sufficient to be defined as a pandemic, it should also be transmissible [2]. A pandemic increases morbidity and mortality in a very large geographic area and provokes social and political deterioration. It has a vital position throughout human history and in the development of civilizations. Due to profound socioeconomic problems caused by pandemics, they have resulted in changes in the agenda of countries and put forward issues, most particularly sanitation rules, that people should pay attention to while coexisting.

The transmission of plague to Europe became possible by the Chinese merchandise sold to Europe by Asian traders [4]. It is known that the fleas and mice on the ship were effective in the spread of the disease. In the meantime, Crimean Tatars had invaded Genoese harbor and thrown their dead bodies carrying the plague using catapults into the city and transmitted the disease to the Italians [4]. The first Italian cities to encounter the plague were Genoa, Messina, and Venice. Afterwards, the plague arrived to Paris in 1348 and affected London in 1349, and after having penetrated into Scotland and Scandinavia, it reached to its origin, the land of the Tatars. It caused death of one-thirds of people living in Europe. Shortly after the spread of the pandemic, people experienced psychological destruction. Nonetheless, the aftermath of the plague saw a rise in the lack of confidence towards administrations, cutback in social activities and communication and led people to distance themselves from one another and caused an increase in product and labor. An economic collapse was seen in the world, mainly in Europe that had just started to recover from famine [4]. ",

It should be seriously questioned whether hospitals would have the extreme capacity to treat a large number of patients or not.

Other measures include planning healthcare services in alternative settings other than hospitals, taking necessary infection control measures, and drawing up clear guidelines in favor of public health for patient consent [11].

WHO should announce data independently and in a transparent manner; thus, WHO requires accurate and rapid data flow from every government in order to fulfill its obligation [15].

This process contains epidemiologic and sensitivity factors such as travel history, incubation period, and estimated transmission potential. Following risk and exposure assessments, these two assessments are finalized with a content evaluation. Content evaluation is the assessment of the setting the event has taken or is taking place. Content evaluation includes social, technological, scientific, economic, ethical, and political factors. Exposure and content evaluations are made, and risk is characterized. Risk characterization seeks to regulate the probability and impact of every risk. Risk characterization uses these evaluations in order to assess if a specific flu virus has the potential to become pandemic and to what extent the society will be affected by such event and thus to judge the urgency and scope of risk management activities. Risk assessment is a constant process during risk management continuity. For the evaluation of pandemic severity to be beneficial, it should be performed when public health decisions are required [13].",

Nonpharmaceutical interventions can be the only effective measure in many countries. During the onset of a pandemic, there would probably be no pandemic vaccination that would be effective against the novel virus. Non-pharmaceutical interventions in the early stage of the pandemic should be implemented in order to slow down transmission and decrease its effect. These interventions include social distancing (staying home when ill), coughing etiquette (covering the mouth with a handkerchief while coughing or sneezing), and hygiene rules such as washing the hands and cleaning the surfaces and objects touched. Extreme measures can be taken and implemented during severe pandemics including patients wearing masks (surgical masks), school closings, and diminishing contact between people.

            "text": "Pandemic diseases may result in acute, short-term fiscal shocks and long-term damage in economic growth. Early period public health efforts (such as monitoring contact, implementing quarantine, isolating contagious cases) in order to cover or limit pandemics require significant human resources and personnel cost. As a pandemic expands, new facilities may be needed to be constructed to manage additional contagious cases, and health system expenses will tremendously increase as a result of demand in medical supplies, personal protective equipment, and medicine. Decreasing tax revenue may deepen the fiscal stress caused by increasing expenses in low- and middle-income countries that have weak tax systems and severe fiscal restrictions. This dynamic was seen in the Western Africa Ebola pandemic in Liberia in 2014. As costs increased, economic activity slowed down, and quarantines and curfews decreased the government\u2019s capacity to collect revenues. During a mild-to-moderate pandemic, high income countries that are not affected can balance fiscal crises in low income countries by providing official recovery support including direct budget support. Meanwhile, high income countries may be faced with the same fiscal stresses and be unwilling to provide help. During a severe pandemic, low- and middle-income countries may cut back in government expenses. Negative economic crises are derived from workforce reduction due to disease and deaths and behavior change out of fear. Fear manifests itself with many behavioral changes. The analysis of the economic effects of the 2014 Western Africa Ebola pandemic has shown decrease in workforce, shutdown in businesses, delay in transportation, closing of land borders by some governments, restrictions implemented on citizens arriving from affected regions in entry to the country, cancellation of commercial flights, decrease in shipment and prevention in travel and trade. These effects decrease the participation of the pandemic to workforce and constrict local and regional trade. Preventive behavior (such as prevention of travel, restaurant and public spaces and workplace discontinuity as prophylactics) also has economic outcomes. During a severe pandemic, all sectors of the economy (agriculture, manufacture, services) encounter shortages, rapid price elevation is basic necessities, deterioration that causes economic stress for the household, private firms, and governments. A severe pandemic may result in a significant and permanent economic damage [27]. ",
