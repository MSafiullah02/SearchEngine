Another consistent finding is that bacterial groups that are most prevalent within a patient also do not tend to vary substantially in relative abundance over time. The most prevalent communities identified by culture-independent investigations mirror those species or genera detected in clinical cultures, such as P aeruginosa, Burkholderia, and Staphylococcus. When prevalent, these bacterial groups in essence represent core members of the CF respiratory microbiome, but results of culture-independent analyses suggest that additional bacterial groups, not usually detected by typical CF clinical culture methods, comprise this core. For example, using approaches that partition the distribution of species based on statistical variance/abundance ratios, investigators in one study reported that, in addition to Pseudomonas, anaerobic species, such as members of the Porphyromonas, Prevotella, and Veillonella genera, also contribute to their study cohort\u2019s core group of microbiota (a total of 15 taxa from 7 genera).5 This finding contrasted with the greater range of bacterial groups (67 taxa from 33 genera) comprising a satellite group of microbiota, which did not correlate with any clinical factors.

For example, in CF pulmonary exacerbations, no consistent changes in airway bacterial burden or community composition have been observed among patients within a given study or compared across studies.6, 7, 51 Some patients show marked shifts in their respiratory bacterial community structures at a given exacerbation, whereas others show very little change despite clinical symptoms suggestive of such events. Moreover, patients across different studies have shown exacerbation-related reductions in the abundance of baseline predominant species, suggesting that increased abundance of less prevalent microbiota members may play a greater role in certain exacerbations. In addition, antibiotic treatments for exacerbations do not cause a sustained shift in bacterial community structure following exacerbation.6, 7 The CF airway microbiome is generally resilient to these perturbations with community reassembly after recovery resembling a patient\u2019s baseline community structure.7\n",

In a study of sputum samples from 4 patients with CF, 60% of the identified fungal taxa were not detected by mycological cultures.13 In addition to Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, 30 fungal species or genera identified included other species of Candida and Aspergillus, Penicillium, Malassezia, and Kluyveromyces. Another study of 6 subjects with CF found that a mixture of Candida and Malassezia species dominated 74% to 99% of fungal sequence reads from sputum, although the samples were collected at the time of admission, and after completion of antibacterial therapy, which could influence these findings.14 One of the largest studies to date, involving 56 patients,54 found that the number of fungal species detected in CF sputum was higher than that for bacteria but also fluctuated much more over time. The investigators concluded that this suggests that inhalational exposure is a greater driving factor in the detection of fungi than established fungal colonization in CF airways. Other culture-independent, nonsequencing approaches to identify fungal species, such as denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography,15 have also been explored using CF sputa. However, the utility of this approach compared with others remains uncertain.",

High phage/bacteria ratios have been described in a variety of mucosal environments, including human gingival samples, and in vitro studies have shown phage adherence to mucus to be mediated by binding interactions between immunoglobulinlike domains on phage capsids and glycan residues on mucin glycoproteins.64 Further, pretreatment of mucus-producing cell lines with T4 phages led to subsequent decreased bacterial attachment (Escherichia coli) to the cells. These findings have led investigators to propose that bacteriophage adherence to mucus may serve as a form of antibacterial immunity along mucosal surfaces. However, the potential significance of this system extrapolated to the CF lung remains unclear. Other data also suggest that phages may be functionally synergistic with antibiotics, wherein antibiotics stimulate phage production and/or activity to aid bacterial killing.65 Lytic activity of temperate phages may also be preserved long-term in chronic P aeruginosa infection and potentially contribute to controlling P aeruginosa density.62\n",

Although children without CF were not included as a control group for comparison in these studies, this observation is consistent with normal patterns of gut microbiome maturation in early life in healthy infants.70, 71 Changes in diet also influenced respiratory microbiota composition, indicating links to nutritional intake.19 Decreases in specific bacterial genera, both in the gut (Parabacteroides) and in the respiratory tract (Haemophilus), preceded airway colonization with P aeruginosa.20 Another interesting observation was that intestinal, but not respiratory, bacterial community structure in the first 6 months of life was associated with the occurrence of CF exacerbations during that time frame. Findings from these types of studies, as well as those from interventional trials using probiotic species,72, 73 suggest that manipulations of the gut microbiome to foster a less proinflammatory environment could be an avenue to mitigate pulmonary morbidity in CF.",

            "text": "The new insights afforded by the studies described earlier provide a foundation for addressing several important questions pertaining to the microbiology of CF. As clinicians continue to explore the long-term dynamics of airway bacterial community structure, a focus will be on better elucidating the relationship between decreasing community diversity and advancing patient age and lung disease. An intriguing question is whether maintaining more diverse communities might have a positive impact on lung health, and, if so, whether novel treatment strategies (eg, targeted species-specific antimicrobial therapy) may enable maintenance of healthier airway communities. A more complete understanding of short-term community dynamics may identify reproducible changes in community structure and/or activity that are associated with changes in patient clinical condition. If multiomic analyses identify, for example, biomarkers of impending exacerbation, it will be of great interest to determine whether these can be monitored in real time and exploited to prevent or better manage these events. Similarly, specific patterns of community change may be identified that predict exacerbation severity and/or recovery.",

Advances in the appreciation of how microbial interactions drive the activity of polymicrobial communities are expected to provide opportunities for novel therapies. In addition, continued investigation of the relationship between disordered gut microbiota and lung disorder in CF has the potential to translate to creative management strategies and to generate mechanistic hypotheses addressing CF pathobiology.",
