This surgical procedure was first described by George Crile in 1906 although reports of similar procedures of en bloc resections go back to 1888 when Franciszek Jawdynski \u2013 a Polish surgeon \u2013 reported four cases. The work of Crile was further popularized by several surgeons including the famous American surgeon, Hayes Martin. However, the morbidity accompanying the radical approach of the original procedure stimulated the development of a more conservative approach. Based on anatomical understanding of the lymphatic anatomy of the neck, Suarez introduced the principles of functional neck dissection in 1963. Later, Ettore Bocca published a description of an operative technique in the English literature aiming at the preservation of the non-lymphatic structures of the neck resulting in a better functional outcome and less morbidity, at the same time obtaining equivalent oncologic results [4, 5].",

The resulting data allowed for a more conservative approach depending on the negligible risk of involvement of certain nodal regions in various oncologic scenarios ending in a wide range of surgical procedures. This variation called for an updated classification and nomenclature of operations involving surgical excision of the cervical lymphatics. In order to achieve this, AAO-HNS sponsored the work of the Committee of Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology to develop a unified classification of neck dissection operations. The first classification was established in 1991; this was later modified in 2002 and 2008 to become the currently accepted classification [7\u201311].",

The causative organism is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, though it can also be caused by other mycobacteria. Though TB can virtually involve any body organ, the lymphatic system is the most common site of extrapulmonary affection, within which cervical LNs are the most commonly involved [24]. The portal of entry usually determines the affected nodal group; involvement of jugulodigastric LNs usually denotes infection entering through tonsils or adenoids, while a pulmonary source is usually manifested by supraclavicular lymphadenopathy [25]. Histopathologically, tuberculous LNs demonstrate epithelioid, macrophages and giant cells, caseation necrosis, and scanty acid fast bacilli appearing as fragmented or beaded rods inside or outside cells [26].",

Exclusion of malignancy is in fact the first and the single most important aim sought by the physician when evaluating CLA. The incidence of malignancy in patients with CLA seems to vary considerably with their demographics: age, gender, and race. The rate of malignant etiologies rises with age. A cross-sectional study by Biswas et al. [19] demonstrated that the rate of malignancy among patients with CLA was 12.1 %, 21.7 %, and 100 % in the age groups <14, 15\u201359, and \u226560 years, respectively. In their study, Shakya et al. [34] observed a malignancy rate as high as 50 % in patients with CLA in 51\u201360-year age group. Such high incidence of malignancy among the aforementioned age groups led to the belief that any neck mass in an adult should be suspected as malignant until proven otherwise [35]. Gender issue has also been studied with the uniform finding of higher frequency of malignancy among males [36]. Similarly, incidence of malignancy in patients with CLA differs among different racial groups. A malignancy rate as high as 50 % was observed among Iranians presenting with unknown neck masses [37], while it was 28.2 % and 4.8 % among Indians and Nepalese, respectively [19, 34].",

Polyarthritis of small joints, lasting more than 6 weeks together with elevation of serum rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA), and acute phase reactants (APR) is diagnostic for RA [44]. Presence of malar rash, discoid rash, nonerosive arthritis, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, and renal, neurologic, and hematologic disorders and elevated antinuclear antibodies and anti-DNA antibodies are diagnostic of SLE [45]. Dryness of the mouth and eyes is suggestive of Sjogren\u2019s syndrome [46].",

Therefore, AIT including HT should be included in differential diagnosis of patients with thyroid nodes and cervical LNs.

Lymph nodes may also show ischemic changes in the form of necrotic foci, developing below the capsule and accompanied by fibrin thrombi in the surrounding small vessels [57]. Diagnosis should be clinically suspected in the presence of: (1) fever more than 5 days; (2) cervical lymphadenopathy, usually unilateral; (3) edema, erythema, and/or desquamation of the palms and soles; (4) non-purulent bilateral conjunctivitis; and (5) strawberry tongue. A high index of suspicion should be kept when evaluating these children as the condition may be complicated by coronary artery abnormalities (aneurysm, thrombosis, infarctions) in 25 % of untreated children.

Night sweats and shivers can suggest tuberculosis (TB).\nLocalized symptoms of malignancy: Hoarseness of voice, dysphagia, stridor, ulcers, and pain should be sought, especially when a high index of suspicion is available.\nGeneralized symptoms of malignancy: Weight loss: an unexplained weight loss of more than 10 % during a period of 6 months should raise suspicion of lymphoma [74].\nSymptoms of collagenic disease: Arthralgia, joint deformities, or myalgia.\nMedical history: Allergies to certain drugs are common causes for lymphadenopathy (e.g., phenytoin).\nOccupational and epidemiological exposures: History of a high-risk behavior, recent traveling to high-risk regions, or exposure to pets or specific occupational hazards can all suggest a specific underlying etiology, sometimes of a rare incidence.\nDuration and response to previous medications: A short history of lymphadenopathy may favor acute infectious etiologies (viral, bacterial, etc.), while persistent nodal enlargement (more than 4 weeks) accompanies chronic infections, collagenic diseases, and malignancies. Also, response to previous medications (e.g., antimicrobials) may help validate the underlying pathology.\n",

Generalized lymphadenopathy accompanies systemic diseases specially if associated with splenomegaly. In the neck, supraclavicular LNs drain the gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, and lungs. Enlarged supraclavicular LNs should raise a strong suspicion of malignancy as an underlying malignancy occurs in 54\u201385 % of cases [73, 75\u201377].\nSize: The LNs of subcentimeter diameter are usually of no clinical significance, while LNs more than 2 cm in size of persistent nature mandate thorough diagnostic workup [72].\nMobility: Fixed LNs suggest metastatic causes, while freely movable nodes have a wide range of underlying etiologies including primary malignancies (e.g., lymphoma). Evaluation of supraclavicular LN mobility can be aided by performance of Valsalva maneuver.\nConsistency: Hard LNs usually suggest a malignant nature. However, other forms of consistency can still accompany malignant nodes, and therefore consistency should not be relied upon for differentiation of the nodal nature. A tender LN can point out an underlying inflammatory process [78].\n",

            "text": "The main application of CT for cervical nodal assessment is in the setting of evaluation of metastatic LNs in the head and neck region in different clinical scenarios:I.Documented head and neck malignancy by biopsy or other imaging technique with no clinically palpable LNs, for confirmation of the N0 state as any evidence of nodal metastasis will alter both the staging and management of the tumor. It should be noted that cervical LNs metastasis represents the most important prognostic factor for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) as it decreased the overall survival by 50 %; another 50 % worse prognosis would be expected on evidence of extracapsular extension [87\u201389]. At the same time, the level, number, and dimensions of the affected LNs have their clinical implications and are proved to correlate with distant metastases [87, 90].II.Documented head and neck malignancy with palpable LNs on one side of the neck, for evaluation of the contralateral neck side. During evaluation, nodal necrosis should be considered the most important criterion for detection of metastatic LNs in the setting of head and neck cancer with specificity around 95 to 100 %; this appears as focal hypoattenuation of CT and T2 hyperintensity on MRI with peripheral nodal enhancement [91]. Detection of necrosis and cystic changes in LNs not qualifying to be considered metastatic on size basis is crucial during the evaluation process.Size of the cervical LNs should not be a definitive criterion to exclude malignancy, as LNs less than 1 cm in the largest diameter can still contain malignant tissue and expanding the cutoff size to 1.5 cm in some centers can result in higher rates of false-negative findings.For proper evaluation, the radiologist should be aware of both the simplified level classification of cervical LNs for easier communication with surgeons and pathologist and the drainage patterns of different head and neck malignancies, meticulous examination of the commonly affected levels is crucial before declaring the neck as N0. A finding of a less commonly affected level in the context of evaluating a certain malignancy should warrant reexamination of the more commonly affected nodes.The ability of CT to detect micrometastases is restricted. Thus, tumors with high tendency for sending micrometastases are usually managed by neck dissection procedures even if no positive LNs are detected.Extracapsular extension of tumor tissue has its significant impact in both the prognosis and probability of distant metastasis. However, this does not affect the staging of head and neck malignancies. It should be noted though that CT is not precise in detection of such extension.III.For evaluation of carotid artery invasion by metastatic nodal tissue.In many centers and in various clinical scenarios, carotid artery invasion by tumor tissue renders the tumor irresectable (although different surgical techniques may be pursued). Thus, detection of such invasion has a great influence on the planned management. Unfortunately, CT is not precise in detection of direct carotid artery invasion. The reliance on the contact surface alone between tumor tissue and carotid artery can be hugely misleading as a single focal contact can be accompanied by evident intraoperative invasion. Studies show no superiority in CT for detection of carotid artery invasion compared to Doppler studies.IV.For postoperative follow-up for evidence of recurrent primary and nodal disease.The CT is a valuable tool in postoperative survey of recurrence at the primary site or at the nodal levels, where radiotherapy and postoperative fibrosis result in difficult LN palpation.V.In case of metastatic LN proven by biopsy without a clinically proven source of primary (CUP) for the detection of the primary site of malignancy.Computed tomography of the head and neck, chest, and abdomen can help localize the site of clinically non-evident malignancy. Careful examination of aerodigestive mucosa is mandatory as a finding of focal thickening may save the patient from more aggressive and invasive diagnostic approaches.It should be noted that a finding of cystic LN in young patients can point out occult metastasis of thyroid origin; this finding can be mistaken with developmental cystic lesions of the neck in this age group.\n",
