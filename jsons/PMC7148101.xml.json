Objective sensor data is collected using the FitBit Versa 2 sport watch3; subjective wellness, training load and injury data is collected using the PMSYS system4; and information about meals, drinks, medication, etc. is collected using Google Forms. The data contain information about daily sleeping patterns, daily heart rate, sport activities, logs of food consumed during the training period (from at least 2 participants) and self reported data like mode, stress, fatigue, readiness to train and other measurements also used for professional soccer teams. The data are collected over a period of four to five month. The copyright and ethical approval to release the data are obtained by the task organizers.
