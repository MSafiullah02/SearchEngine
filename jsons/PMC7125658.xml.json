The syndrome is a condition characterized by an atypical pneumonia, efficient transmission and high mortality rate. Presently, the SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) has spread to more than 30 countries all over the world. Over 8000 cases of SARS\u2010CoV infected individuals were reported, with about 10% mortality. SARS\u2010CoV may have originated in animals and its efficient human\u2010to\u2010human transmission is similar to that of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and resulted in the global outbreak of the disease in the year 2003 [1, 2].",

Following the complete sequencing of SARS\u2010CoV genomes, homologies for UC\u2010ORFs were sought.

SARS\u2010CoV infected culture cells provided experimental evidence on the expression and translation levels for individual ORFs [7].

Interestingly, ORF7a most likely reflects an internal duplication with traces of similarity to ORF8a and ORF7b at both termini.

Most notable is the observation that almost all UC\u2010ORFs are homologous to viral proteins within the coronaviruses lineage (ORF3a, ORF8a, and ORF9a) and other viral groups. We favor the idea that most UC\u2010ORFs are reminiscent of genetic dynamics in the evolution of the virus. This is indirectly supported by inspecting the tens of SARS\u2010CoV variants whose sequences were archived in the public database. We evaluated the average number of amino\u2010acids that were changed in all SARS\u2010CoV variants for the known 6 ORFs, as well as for the other 8 UC\u2010ORFs. A reasonable assumption is that the evolutionary pressure for amino acid synonym conservation might be weaker for redundant and non\u2010functional genomic regions. We tested whether the UN\u2010ORFs (recall their genomic organization at the vicinity of structural genes, Fig. 1) are more prone to mutations that lead to amino acids substitutions. Indeed, we counted 109 such amino acid changes for all known ORFs (total of 9047 amino acids, Table 1) and 17 changes for all UC\u2010ORFs (total length of 878 amino acids). The amounts of amino acid changes (normalized per amino acid) are in favor of the UC\u2010ORFs by a ratio of 1.6:1.0, reflecting the tendency of non\u2010synonymous mutations in UC\u2010ORFs to accumulate. Interestingly, by taking into account only non\u2010conserved amino acid changes (based on aa similarity groups, as in Fig. 4), the accumulation of amino acid changes is almost double for the UC\u2010ORFs relative to all other ORFs.",

In coronaviruses, transcription efficiency was correlated with the presence of transcription\u2010regulating sequences (TRS). As well as the characterized ORFs, the S, E and N proteins (Spike, Envelope and Nucleocapsid, respectively) that contain the minimal core sequence of the TRS in the vicinity of their initiation AUG, the ORF3a, ORF7a and ORF8a also contain such a sequence. None of the `nested' ORFs (ORF3b, ORF7b, ORF8b and ORF9b) have a genuine TRS and their transcription suggests a TRS independent mode (discussed in [6]).

Based on inspection of ORF1a,b, an event of recombination between mammalian and avian viral origin was proposed [19]. A recent survey of the mutational patterns suggests that the accumulation of mutations (and their nature) is reflected by the genomic organization of the various coronaviruses, among which the SARS\u2010CoV showed a unique rate of mutational stabilization [20]. Our observations suggest that some of the UC\u2010ORFs have originated from a duplication of structural proteins of the coronaviruses lineage (2, 3, 5). Although at that stage it is very speculative, the similarity of the UC\u2010ORFs with human viral proteins such as lentivirus, arterivirus and megalovirus (not shown and Table 1) is intriguing. It is plausible that some of the information exchange mechanisms from and to the SARS\u2010CoV had occurred through a multi\u2010infected host cells (probably in mammals). At present, the candidate host for SARS\u2010CoV is a civet cat [21], though this has not been fully confirmed. Our observations provide additional support for an active mode for internal exchanging of genetic information during the evolution of the SARS\u2010CoV (Fig. 5).",

            "text": "It is logical to assume that, along the evolutionary process, viruses tend to eliminate non\u2010functional ORFs and minimize the non\u2010essential genetic replication load. In the case of SARS\u2010CoV, we may be witnessing an early stage of the virus evolution, in which a small part of the genome is still occupied by very short overlapping non\u2010functional ORFs. Tens of new SARS\u2010CoV variants that were recently sequenced possibly indicate rapid accumulation of genetic variations in UC\u2010ORFs, much above the extent of this phenomenon in functional ORFs (replicase and structural ORFs). For example, the amino acid substitutions detected in ORF4 and ORF5 (E and M protein, respectively) are mostly conserved, while changes that occur in the coding regions of the UC\u2010ORFs (in ORF3a, ORF6, ORF8b and ORF9b) are by large non\u2010conserved. In one variant of the virus, a single nucleotide deletion resulted in a frame shift change in two of the overlapping UC\u2010ORFs (not shown). In general, UC\u2010ORFs tend to accumulate almost twice as many non\u2010conserved amino acids compared to all other functional ORFs (Table 1). This observation is consistent with the notion that most UC\u2010ORFs are redundant for the infectivity and the life cycle of the virus.",

From this perspective, the UC\u2010ORFs resemble the origin and dynamics of pseudogenes in high eukaryotes [22]. Ranging from yeast to human, many pseudogenes resulted from an early duplication, that followed by mutation accumulation, leading to inactivation of their coding region. In a complementary process, alteration in transcriptional and translational signals may cause the gene to become non\u2010functional and consequently to reduce the mutational selective pressure, causing the expansion of pseudogenes.",
