            "text": "Surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA) is still challenging with perioperative mortality rates ranging from 40 to 60% in most studies [1, 2]. Reports suggest a wide variation in perioperative mortality [2, 3]. The incidence of rAAA and the perioperative mortality has declined over the last two decades, and lower mortality may be due to the implementation of endovascular repair and improved pre- and in-hospital care [2, 4, 5]. Previous studies have mainly focused on the perioperative period, and less attention has been paid to the long-term outcome in patients who do survive the first 30 days. The latest Cochrane review [6] stated that long-term data on survival and late complications are scarce after both endovascular and open treatments of rAAA. Factors that may affect survival past the perioperative period in patients operated for rAAA have been described in a few previous reports, and the results are not consistent [7, 8]. Few population-based studies on long-term outcome with an adequate follow-up time are available [9]; the majority of these studies are from a pre-selected population, i.e. not population-based, and thus, the generalizability of the findings is questionable.",

            "text": "Cause of death is well documented in the randomized trials on rAAA [29, 33, 35], but rarely reported in other investigations on long-term survival in rAAA [8, 22, 25]. The IMPROVE trial [29] reported an aneurysm-related cause of death in 4.4%, cardiovascular 10.9%, pulmonary 8.2% and cancer 7.1%. A previous population-based study found ischaemic heart disease (36%) to be the primary cause of death in both elective and ruptured aneurysm repairs [19]. A German study reported that patients surviving the first 6 months died of the same causes as the age- and gender-matched population [36]. In the present study, none of the deaths registered after 6 months can be directly related to the prior surgical treatment of rAAA. The cause of death was known in about two-thirds of patients who died during follow-up. According to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health [37] cardiovascular, cancer and pulmonary diseases are the cause of death in 25, 25 and 10% of cases in Norway, respectively. Thus, deaths from cancer may have been overrepresented in the study group.",
