During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, monitoring patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using viral kinetics or viral loads in various sample types by real-time RT-PCR has become essential. However, understanding whether the RT-PCR test results are interpreted as quantitative, qualitative, or semi-quantitative is important. Since the cycle threshold (Ct) values from RT-PCR can be affected by batch effect, variations among different runs need to be closely monitored by laboratories\u2014especially for quality control in quantitative RT-PCR. Unfortunately, several papers on COVID-19 use the naive Ct values from qualitative RT-PCR as a quantitation unit or use the \u0394Ct values with incorrect quantitation unit.2, 3 Quantitative RT-PCR is entirely different from qualitative RT-PCR. Ct value itself cannot be directly interpreted as viral load without a standard curve using reference materials. Thorough evaluation of the reliability and robustness of the standard curve is the key to accurately quantify the expected viral copy number.",

A two-step approach using qualitative RT-PCR (for detection) and quantitative RT-PCR (for viral load quantification) is highly recommended for studies focusing on viral loads, as clearly presented by Lescure and colleagues.1 Furthermore, using appropriate quantification units according to different sample types\u2014ie, copies per 1000 cells (for respiratory samples), copies per mL (for plasma), and copies per g (for stool)\u2014should be followed by clinicians, as outstandingly shown by Lescure and colleagues.1\n",
