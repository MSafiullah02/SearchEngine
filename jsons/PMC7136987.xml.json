One element of this policy will be global health, a subject often characterised by controversy. The debate that will shape the next administration's approach to global health has begun, including the decision by the US Institute of Medicine to update its 1997 report on US global-health priorities.1 What principles might inform this debate?",

Ideally, these discussions would be informed by the metaphor of global health as public health, so that priorities would move closer to the actual, rather than the commonly perceived, contributors to the burden of disease, with a greater emphasis on non-communicable diseases and mental illness. Yet, unless these discussions take account of the other metaphors, which are likely to dominate the definition of broader US foreign policy, any proposals risk being marginalised. The Institute of Medicine's 1997 report1 identified the key issues as \u201cglobal health as security\u201d and \u201cglobal health as foreign policy\u201d. Now the challenge is to build a coalition that embraces the principal metaphors being used, explicitly aligning the pursuit of public health with foreign policy, security, charity, and investment and, when contradictions emerge, exposing and dealing with them. The UK's new global-health strategy, which does just this, might be a good place to start.12\n",
