            "text": "Norovirus (NoV) is an approximately 7.5-Kbp single positive-strand RNA virus that has been classified into the Caliciviridae, genus Norovirus (Clarke et al., 2011). There are 3 open reading frames (ORFs) in the NoV genome. ORF1 encodes NTPase (helicase), Vpg and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein, VP1, and ORF3 encodes the minor capsid protein, VP2. (Clarke et al., 2011, Zheng et al., 2006). NoV has been classified into 6 genogroups, GI-GVI (Clarke et al., 2011, White, 2014), based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the full-length VP1 region. NoV genogroups are further classified into subgenogroups. For example, in GIV NoV, GIV HNoV is classified into subgenogroup 1 (GIV.1) while GIV FNoV and GIV CNoV are classified into subgenogroup 2 (GIV.2). GI, GII, and GIV (GIV.1) have been identified in humans, GII in pigs, GIII in ruminants including cattle, GIV (GIV.2) in cats and lions, GV in mice, and GIV(GVI.2) and GVI(GVI.1 and GVI.2) in dogs (Clarke et al., 2011). The first NoV in carnivores was detected in captive lion cubs with severe enteritis (Martella et al., 2007).",

Based on the results of the Simplot analysis, the FNoV M49-1 strain (GVI.1) may have been produced by recombination between GIV.2 FNoV and GVI.1 CNoV. It currently remains unclear which of these 3 viruses has the same origin. The number of GIV NoV and GVI NoV samples needs to be increased and a gene analysis performed in order to investigate their origins. The high homology of a part of VP1 between GVI.1 CNoV and oyster-derived NoV was previously reported (Martella et al., 2009). Cat No. 49, which carried the FNoV M49-1 strain, was captured in a region along the sea in which oyster farming is thriving. Thus, we cannot rule out that the FNoV M49-1 strain was derived from oysters, and needs to be investigated in future studies.",

Three out of 4 cats inoculated with the fecal emulsion developed diarrhea while one started vomiting. The development of these symptoms was almost consistent with the FNoV gene-detecting period, suggesting that FNoV is the cause of infectious gastroenteritis in cats. However, it is difficult to demonstrate the pathogenicity of FNoV based on these results because only 4 cats were used in this infection experiment. Moreover, the presence of unknown pathogens in the fecal emulsion cannot be ruled out. In order to concretely demonstrate that FNoV is the cause of infectious gastroenteritis, an infection experiment needs to be conducted that meets the following conditions: (1) FNoV isolated from a fecal emulsion is used to infect animals, (2) the number of cats is increased, and (3) a negative control is included in the experiment. Furthermore, difficulties are associated with accurately assessing pathogenicity using the FNoV M49-1 strain alone. Therefore, new strains of FNoV need to be isolated from cats in Japan and several FNoV strains used in infection experiments.",
