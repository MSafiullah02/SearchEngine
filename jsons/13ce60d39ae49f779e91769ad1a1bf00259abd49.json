Since retrospective serological and/or epidemiological data on these populations are available, providing estimates of the dates of the onset of the HIV-1 epidemics, we had the opportunity to test different phylogenetic models for their accuracy in deriving the recent evolutionary history of HIV-1 subtype B and the onset date of the HIV-1 epidemic. We observed that, in any given year, individual sequences vary widely in their distances to the common ancestor, and sequences close to the ancestors were found decades after the onset of the epidemic. Nevertheless, the mean evolutionary distances of virus strains to ancestors were increasing significantly during the course of the studied epidemics, which indicates that the molecular clock is operational in the recent evolution of HIV-1. When the relationship between the sampling years of sequences and their nucleotide distances to the common ancestor was extrapolated to the past, analysis of pol sequences provided accurate estimates of the onset years of the epidemics, whereas analysis of V3 sequences by the maximum-likelihood or neighbor-joining methods led to an overestimation of the age of the epidemics. Separate analysis of nonsynonymous and synonymous distances revealed that this overestimation results from nonsynonymous substitutions, whose numbers were not increasing significantly in all three virus populations over the observation period. In contrast, analysis of synonymous env V3 distances provided accurate estimates of the onset years for the outbreaks we studied.",

Although the concept of a molecular clock is widely used, it is not universally accepted and applicable. The clock's existence in general is the subject of debate, and the concept is often applied to a specific virus group without proof of its clock-like evolution. So far, clock-like evolution has been demonstrated based on longitudinally collected sequence information only for influenza A viruses (Buonagurio et al. 1986; Fitch et al. 1991) . On the other hand, the evolution of the vesicular stomatitis viruses has been shown to be inconsistent with the molecular clock hypothesis (Nichol et al. 1993; Gillespie 1993) .",

The date of the subsequent event in the HIV-1 history-the onset of virus diversification within HIV-1 group M and the separation of HIV-1 genetic subtype lineages-has recently been estimated to be in the 1910s or 1930s, with 95% confidence intervals of several decades (Goudsmit and Lukashov 1999; Korber et al. 1998 Korber et al. , 2000 Salemi et al. 2001) . The above calculations, which were based on the analysis of evolutionary distances of contemporary HIV-1 sequences to the group M common node, do not support an earlier statement that HIV-1 group M viruses probably shared a common ancestor \"in the 1940s or the early 1950s\" (Zhu et al. 1998) , which was based on an HIV-1 sequence sampled in 1959. Taken together, these estimates suggest that the separation within HIV-1 group M occurred decades before the onset of the global HIV-1 epidemic.",

In particular, the reconstruction of the nodal (ancestral) sequence is error-prone and depends on the nucleotide substitution model invoked, the distances of individual sequences to the ancestor may be not independent, etc. It has been shown that phylogenetic methods differ in their reliability in reconstructing a known HIV-1 transmission chain (Leitner et al. 1999 ). In the present study, we attempted to test various existing phylogenetic methods for their accuracy in deriving the recent evolutionary history of HIV-1 subtype B and the onset date of the global epidemic. For this purpose, we collected and analyzed longitudinal sequence data representing three outbreaks of the global HIV-1 epidemic: (i) in the United States and among (ii) homosexual men and (iii) injecting drug users (IDUs) in The Netherlands. Since the onset years of these outbreaks had been established based on retrospective epidemiological and/or serological data, we could determine which phylogenetic model and which genomic region of HIV would yield the most reliable estimates. Our analysis was based on two genomic regions of HIV-1-a fast-evolving env gp120 V3 region [270 nucleotides (nt)] and a much more conserved region of the pol gene (protease/partial reverse transcriptase; 804 nt)-for which we collected extensive longitudinal sequence data with known date of sampling.",

A positive linear relationship between the sampling year of the individual sequences in an HIV-1 population and their evolutionary distances to the common ancestor of that population according to formula (1) allows us to put a time scale on this relationship, which can be extrapolated back to determine the diversification of the HIV-1 population (D T \u202b\u05e1\u202c 0 when T \u202b\u05e1\u202c T 0 ). If the HIV-1 epidemic in a given human population started after the expansion of a single HIV-1 strain (the heterogeneity of the founder virus population was effectively equal to 0), the date of the onset of that epidemic can then be determined. If this condition is met, which is likely the case for the U.S. and Dutch drug users (Grmek 1990; Kuiken and Goudsmit 1994; Kuiken et al. 1996b) , the most recent common ancestor of an epidemic coincides with the onset of this epidemic. If this condition is not met, and there have been several virus introductions into a particular risk group, which is likely the case for Dutch homosexual men (Kuiken and Goudsmit 1994; Kuiken et al. 1996b) , the onset of the epidemic would be later than the date of the most recent common ancestor. Therefore, the date calculated for the onset of the epidemic must generally be considered the earliest possible. ",

The ML and NJ methods for nucleotide distances were used as implemented in the PHYLIP package (DNAML and NEIGHBOR, respectively). The DNAML method was based on empirically found base frequencies and transition/transversion ratios, considering different rates of evolution at different positions. The NJ method was based on gamma distances for the Jukes-Cantor method. Our analysis of synonymous (D s ) and nonsynonymous (D n ) substitutions by the ML method was performed using the PAML codem1 program available at http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html (models M1 and M2, respectively) (Yang et al. 2000) . The analysis of D s and D n by the NJ method was performed using the MEGA package (Kumar et al. 1993 ) based on the Nei-Gojobori method with Jukes-Cantor correction. For each of the methods, reference sequences of HIV-1 subtypes other than B, provided by the Los Alamos database (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov), were used to root the trees. For each method, bootstrap resampling was performed (100 replications), resulting in a bootstrap support for the subtype B cluster of at least 80. For each distance estimation method, the evolutionary distances of individual sequences within each set to the most recent common ancestor of the set ( Fig. 1 ) were calculated and analyzed using several statistical approaches.",

There was a strong correlation between the nucleotide distances of individual sequences to the common root estimated by both methods (correlation, 0.81; p < 0.001). The years of the onset of the HIV-1 epidemic in the United States calculated by the NJ and ML methods based on nucleotide distances, were 1953 and 1967, respectively. These results are identical to those reported by Korber et al. (2000) , who estimated the year of HIV-1 introduction in the United States to be 1954 or 1967, based on the analysis of the full-length env gene and depending on the phylogenetic method used. However, these estimates are much earlier than those established based on epidemiological data (Jaffe et al. 1983; Selik et al. 1984) . A clinical syndrome of AIDS was originally recognized in 1981, and earlier cases of AIDS in the United States have not been retrospectively identified before 1978 (Jaffe et al. 1983; Selik et al. 1984) . Since HIV-1 infection has a minimal asymptomatic period of only a few years before AIDS development, the HIV-1 epidemic in the United States is unlikely to have started in the 1950s or 1960s.",

Our analysis of the distances of all individual sequences to the common node (all sequences equally contributing to the analysis) using either the NJ or the ML methods revealed a highly significant positive correlation between the sequence sampling years and their synonymous distances to the common ancestor (p < 0.00001), whereas their nonsynonymous distances to the common ancestor were not significantly increasing (p > 0.1) during the observation period (Figs. 2d and g versus 2c and f, respectively). Extrapolation of the regression line of synonymous distances back to the date when no synonymous heterogeneity was present in the HIV-1 population in the United States allowed us to estimate 1974 (ML)-1976 (NJ) (95% CI, 1972 -1977 1969 -1978 for the ML method) as the onset date of the epidemic in the United States, which accords well with epidemiological data (Jaffe et al. 1983; Selik et al. 1984) . Similarly, when the mean synonymous distances of all U.S. sequences sampled in each year were calculated and regression analysis was based on the mean distances per year (Fig.  2e) , a high correlation (r \u202b\u05e1\u202c 0.98, r 2 \u202b\u05e1\u202c 0.96, p < 0.0001) was revealed between the mean synonymous distances and the sequence sampling years.",

Again, when based on nucleotide distances, the age of the HIV-1 epidemics was strongly overestimated for the Dutch homosexual population (1955 and 1967) and IDUs (1965 and 1975) , according to the NJ and ML methods, respectively. Separate analysis of nonsynonymous and synonymous distances revealed that such overestimation results from nonsynonymous distances, which were not increasing significantly in either virus population over the observation period irrespective of whether the NJ or the ML method was used (data not shown). Nevertheless, for both risk groups and both the NJ and the ML methods, a significant correlation was observed between sequence sampling year and synonymous dis- tance to the ancestor ( Fig. 3 and data not shown) . The HIV-1 subtype B synonymous divergence rates were similar in Dutch homosexual men, Dutch IDUs, and U.S. subjects, indicating that the rate of the molecular clock is relatively stable across various HIV-1 populations. Our analysis revealed that the earliest possible years of the onset of HIV-1 epidemics among Dutch homosexual men and IDUs are 1977 (95% CI: 1976 -1978 ) and 1981 (1980 -1983 , respectively, which is in agreement with the epidemiological data (van Haastrecht et al. 1992) . Similar results for the years of virus introductions were obtained when regression analysis was based on the mean synonymous distances per sampling year (Fig. 4) . As for the U.S. epidemic, this approach resulted in a great increase of the correlation coefficients. Our results suggest that the HIV-1 subtype B epidemic started in Europe 2 or 3 years after it started in the United States, which is in accord with the results of others (Holmes et al. 1995) .",

Additional analysis of HIV-1 subtype B sequences obtained from Africa (Kuiken et al. 1999 ) revealed that their synonymous distances to the subtype B common ancestor are similar to those of U.S. or Dutch sequences sampled in the same year (data not shown), indicating that HIV-1 subtype B strains found in Africa diversified from the common node at the same time as in the United States and Europe. Analysis of our international set of pol sequences gave 1977 (95% CI: 1976 (95% CI: -1980 as the onset year of virus diversification within HIV-1 subtype B.",

We studied the evolution of HIV-1 env and pol regions in the course of three HIV-1 subtype B local epidemics: among mixed risk groups in the United States and among homosexual men and IDUs in The Netherlands. For each epidemic, the most probable common ancestors were reconstructed using several phylogenetic methods, and evolutionary distances of sequences to the common ancestors were analyzed using several statistical approaches. Since the onset of these epidemics is known from rigorous retrospective serological and/or epidemiological data, we could determine whether analysis of evolutionary distances of HIV-1 strains within an epidemic could be used to reveal their onset dates and, moreover, which phylogenetic model and HIV-1 genetic region would provide the most reliable estimate.",

However, these estimates are much earlier than the onset dates established based on epidemiological data (Jaffe et al. 1983; Selik et al. 1984 ). The first U.S. cases of AIDS were retrospectively identified not earlier than 1978 (Jaffe et al. 1983; Selik et al. 1984) . This suggests that the U.S. epidemic probably began in the early or mid 1970s, since the minimal asymptomatic period of an HIV-1 infection is several years. Retrospective epidemiological data suggest 1976 as the onset year of the HIV-1 epidemic in the United States (Grmek 1990) . For the Dutch homosexual men and IDUs, intensive retrospective serological and epidemiological studies established that the HIV-1 epidemics in these risk groups started in 1977 and 1980 , respectively (van Haastrecht et al. 1992 Coutinho et al. 1986 Coutinho et al. , 1987 Lukashov et al. 1996a ).

The authors suggested, that there was a 5-to 15-year \"hidden\" period in the subtype B evolution before the \"visible\" U.S. epidemic started in 1976 -1978 (Korber et al. 2000 . However, the existence of such a long period in HIV-1 evolution in the United States, when the virus would be present in only a few lineages for up to 15 years, is not obvious from the phylogenetic tree of the U.S. HIV-1 strains, in which all individual viruses branch out from virtually a single node and no individual virus lineages-long internal branches-can be distinguished. This indicates that the U.S. epidemic was the result of a rapid propagation of a single virus and suggests either that this hypothetical period has been very short (months, rather than years/decades) or that only one virus strain survived it and gave rise to the U.S. epidemic. This surviving strain is the most recent common ancestor of the current U.S. HIV-1 population. Since this strain did exist at the end of the hypothetical \"hidden\" period, our and earlier (Korber et al. 2000) calculations, which are aimed at the most recent common ancestor, should come to that later date.",

To learn whether the characteristics of the evolution of the fast-evolving env V3 region, compared to the slow-evolving pol or gag regions, could lead to overestimation of the age of the HIV-1 epidemic, we studied synonymous and nonsynonymous distances of the V3 sequences from the United States as well as from the Dutch homosexual men and IDUs to the reconstructed common ancestors of the viruses circulating in these human populations.",

The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that the number of nonsynonymous substitutions that can accumulate within this region is limited due to its functional significance. The lack of increase may be considered an example of functional saturation. Soon after HIV-1 introduction into a human population, the nonsynonymous heterogeneity of the V3 region begins to increase, but this process appears to reach its plateau rapidly, due to the high evolution rate of the V3 region (Lukashov and Goudsmit 1997) . Although the env V3 regions of each and every individual HIV-1 subtype B virus strain are evolving rapidly, and most of the nucleotide substitutions within this region are nonsynonymous, the mean intrasubtype nonsynonymous heterogeneity does not increase beyond a certain limit. This phenomenon can be compared to Brownian movements, in which the continual traffic of a body's atoms does not lead to disintegration of the body. In contrast, synonymous heterogeneity within the V3 region is not subject to this limitation and continues to increase, as still does the nonsynonymous heterogeneity of the pol and gag genes, due to the much lower evolution rate of these genetic regions.",

In our earlier analysis of the two outbreaks of the HIV-1 subtype C epidemic in Ethiopia, we also observed an agreement between the molecular and the seroepidemiological data (Abebe et al. 2001a, b) . Our results suggest that the onset of virus diversification coincided with the onset of the HIV-1 epidemics in each population. They support the theory that the western AIDS epidemic arose in the United States and spread worldwide from there. Our results suggest that the subtype B lineage existed prior to 1975 and that its current worldwide diversity is a result of virus diversification within HIV-1 subtype B that coincided with the onset of the AIDS epidemic in the current risk groups.",

The very fact that the separation between HIV-1 subtype lineages is an older event than diversification within a single HIV-1 subtype is relevant to the breadth of the confidence intervals, but several other factors are also important. It has been noted that some HIV-1 subtypes are significantly more distant from the group M common node than others, which is often interpreted as evidence for different evolution rates of the HIV-1 subtype lineages. However, as our study demonstrates, HIV strains both close to and far from the common ancestor are present in an infected population at any given time point. In the early history of HIV-1, before the global epidemic started, massive population bottlenecks no doubt allowed the survival of only a limited number of virus strains, even a single virus, whose distance to the ancestor could be, by chance, either large or small. This subsequently resulted in distances of the offspring of this virus-current HIV-1 subtypes-being, by chance, either large or small. These random bottleneck events, which are quite difficult to model, would strongly bias reconstruction of the ancient evolutionary history of HIV-1. Thus, by observing a growing plant for a long time, we are able to estimate its growth rate and to trace back in time the moment when the seed started to grow. However, what we cannot easily estimate is the age of this seed and how much time it spent in the soil after being put there by the farmer.",
