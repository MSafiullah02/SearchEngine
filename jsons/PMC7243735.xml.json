E-learning system is an important source of information, due to its ubiquity (availability anywhere and anytime), low cost, ease of use and interactive character. E-learning system such as Blackboard has several fantastic features that would be valuable for use during this Coronavirus pandemic. Using this system in this time might well be more practical. For example, through e-learning system, students may be texting or engaged in some learning activity with teachers on a laptop or mobile device from their home. In addition, students can easily to get learning content into their mobile devices because they can be connected to mobile networks or to local wireless networks. \u00dclker and Y\u0131lmaz (2016) mentioned that one approach to e-learning is the use of learning management system (LMS). Thus, e-learning refers to offer, organize and manage e-learning activities within a system, such as student enrolment, exams, assignments, course descriptions, lesson plans, messages, syllabus, basic course materials, etc. (Haghshenas 2019). By converting from traditional learning, this will enable learner\u2019s access to e-learning systems like Blackboard 24 h per day, and presents several benefits such as increase effectiveness and efficiency of learning services through improved connectivity with teachers and better access to learning materials (Idris and Osman 2015).",

This results in an unsuccessful system and is a waste of universities money (Naveed et al. 2017). Research on this topic is still at its infancy, where the views of the students are not fully studied (Tarhini et al. 2017; Almaiah and Alamri 2018). Studying e-learning adoption can lead universities to better understand their students\u2019 needs, and eventually lead to a successful e-learning system (El-Masri and Tarhini 2017; Alksasbeh et al. 2019). To best of our knowledge, there has not been a thorough analysis of challenges and factors influencing the usage of e-learning system during COVID-19 pandemic; despite that, e-learning systems were introduced in many universities almost 3 years ago. Therefore, this research seeks to investigate the main challenges and factors that affect the usage of e-learning system during COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, we ask the following questions in that respect:What are the main challenges that face the e-learning system usage during COVID-19 Pandemic?What are the main factors that affect the successful usage of e-learning system during COVID-19 Pandemic?",

Thus, in the context of e-learning system, student\u2019s acceptance of e-learning is considered as one of the main criteria for the success e-learning system. Several studies in the literature have addressed issues related to e-learning adoption in many countries over the world. For instance, in Malaysia, Al-Rahmi et al. (Almaiah and Man 2016) used the TAM with IDT model to investigate the critical factors that affect the use of e-learning system Malaysian students. The results revealed that relative advantages, observability, trialability, perceived compatibility, complexity, and perceived enjoyment are the factors that play a significant role in students\u2019 decision to use e-learning system in Malaysia. Salloum et al. (2019) used UAE as a case study for a quantitative investigation. The results indicated that four factors (innovativeness, quality, trust, and knowledge sharing) were observed to achieve better e-learning system acceptance among students. Al-Gahtani (2016) investigated the factors influencing student acceptance of e-learning based on TAM3. He found the most significant determinants of e-learning acceptance were playfulness, self-efficacy and anxiety, while using computers, perceptions of external control, subjective norms and perceived usefulness. However, in the context of Saudi Arabia, social influence, demonstrability and perceived enjoyment were not related to the acceptance of e-learning systems. Another study conducted by Almaiah and Almulhem (Almaiah et al. 2016a), they proposed new framework using Delphi method to determine the success factors of e-learning system implementation in Saudi Arabia. The results highlighted 11 critical factors grouped into four domains that cover website quality, technology options, top management support, and e-learning awareness by academic faculty and students. Bellaaj et al. (2015) used the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to explore the factors affecting students\u2019 use of e-learning systems at the University of Tabuk, Saudi Arabia. They found that expectations regarding performance and effort had a strong influence on e-learning acceptance. In another study in Azerbaijan, Chang et al. (2017) found subjective norms, experience and enjoyment influenced acceptance of e-learning. Abdullah and Ward (2016) also investigated factors influencing e-learning acceptance using TAM. Their findings revealed that self-efficacy; subjective norms, enjoyment, anxiety and experience with using computers had a significant effect on students\u2019 acceptance of e-learning. Similarly, Alhabeeb and Rowley (2017) found that academic staff knowledge of learning technologies, student knowledge of computer systems and technical infrastructure, were significant factors in facilitating the successful acceptance of e-learning in Saudi Arabian universities.",

After this review, we noted that these challenges could be classified into four categories namely (1) technological challenges, (2) individual challenges, (3) cultural challenges and (4) course challenges. We found also that these challenges are very different from one country to another country, due to different culture, context and readiness. For example, lack of ICT knowledge, poor network infrastructure and weakness of content development were the main challenges of e-learning system adoption in developing countries (Aung and Khaing 2015). Another study revealed that system characteristics, internet experience and computer self-efficacy were the main issues that impede the successful adoption of e-learning system in Pakistan (Kanwal and Rehman 2017). A similar study conducted in Kenya identified three main challenges of e-learning are inadequate ICT infrastructure, lack of technical skills and financial constraints (Tarus et al. 2015). A study by Kisanga and Ireson (Mulhanga and Lima 2017) identified that poor interface design; inadequate technical support and lack of IT skills are the primary barriers that hinder the successful implementation of existing e-learning projects. Mulhanga and Lima (Kenan et al. 2013) claimed that cultural, political, and economical constraints are the main reasons to fail the e-learning initiatives in Libya. In the same way, Kenan et al. (Chen and Tseng 2012) classified the challenges that affect the actual use of e-learning into four categories: management challenges, technological challenges, implementation challenges and cultural challenges. Despite these efforts, none of these studies have investigated the actual challenges that face users during the use of e-learning system.",

Three studies mentioned that universities readiness is one of the most significant reasons for the failures of e-learning adoption. However, the problem of low usage and adoption still exists due to some factors that cause learners\u2019 reluctance to use the new technology in Jordan, similar to other developing countries (Al-Khasawneh and Obeidallah 2019) (Almaiah and Al Mulhem 2019).

This study provides some important practical insights into the usage and adoption of e-learning system in developing countries like Jordan and Saudi Arabia. For example, challenges facing the usage of e-learning system are not only limited to the infrastructure issues as mentioned in the previous studies (Almaiah and Almulhem 2018; Almaiah and Alyoussef 2019; Eltahir 2019; Chen and Tseng 2012) but also include other such as e-learning system technical issues, change management issues, course design issues, computer self-efficacy and financial support issues. Therefore, the findings of this study offer useful suggestions for policy-makers, designers, developers and researchers, which will enable them to get better acquainted with the key aspects of the e-learning system adoption successfully. First, the university administration and technical support need to offer the necessary technical resources needed to conduct a constant technical maintenance for e-learning system, because sufficient access to e-learning materials without any technical problem or delay will be significantly associated with increasing the adoption of e-learning system successfully. Second, the university administration needs to provide the necessary hardware, software and internet connection, because if the universities are continuously update the necessary technological resources, then instructors and students would be able to implement the e-learning effectively. Third, the e-learning system designers and developers need to develop the e-learning system to be user-friendly, ease of use and simple, because if students and instructors find the e-learning system is easy to use, then they would be able to implement the e-learning system effectively. Fourth, the policy makers in Jordanian universities need to adopt new policies and regulations to promote the adoption of e-learning system among students and instructors. They also need to make some changes in the educational polices in order to ensure flexible moving from traditional learning to e-learning. These changes can take place through top management support, training programs and instructors\u2019 adherence to the university rules to use the e-learning system in the teaching process. Fifth, the results can guide the university policymakers to focus on increasing the awareness and knowledge of instructors through conducting training programs on how to use the e-learning system, because the instructors have an important role in motivating the students to use the e-learning system, which in turn affects the teaching performance and students\u2019 efficiency. Sixth, the universities need to focus on instilling the culture of e-learning systems among students through training courses about the usefulness of e-learning systems and develop their IT skills. Because if students have sufficient computer skills and positive attitude towards interact with the e-learning system, this would promote the adoption of e-learning system successfully. Overall, the results of this study offer new insights and suggestions for decision makers to ensure the usage and adoption of e-learning systems successfully during COVID-19 pandemic.",
