Public health policies need to address the sex impact of this pandemic so that targeted treatment strategies can be implemented, such as early recognition and aggressive testing in subgroups, and to prevent bias in treating men and women. As the world responds to this extraordinary crisis, we need to have sex specific analysis of the outbreak by health agencies and governments in order to better inform public health policies. We also need to recognize the phenotypical differences in severe case manifestations of COVID-19 in men and women as a fundamental step to understanding the effects of this health emergency on different individuals, families, communities and for creating sustainable and equitable interventions.",

In a mouse model study of SARS-CoV infection, male mice were more susceptible to infection than female mice. The enhanced susceptibility of male mice to SARS-CoV correlated with a moderate increase in virus titer and extensive alveolar macrophages and neutrophil accumulation in the lungs (9) . Furthermore, while gonadectomy did not affect disease outcome in male mice, oophorectomy or treating female mice with an estrogen receptor antagonist did result in an increased mortality to SARS-CoV infection. These findings suggest that estrogen signaling protects female mice from a lethal infection (9) . Sex chromosome genes and sex hormones, including estrogens, progesterone and androgens, contribute to the differential regulation of immune responses between the sexes. Sex-specific disease outcomes following virus infections are attributed to sex-dependent production of steroid hormones, different copy numbers of immune response X-linked genes, and the presence of disease susceptibility genes in males and females (10, 11) .",

Among those women who had severe disease, 6 out of 9 developed this after delivery. As of March 20, 2020, there have been no deaths among these pregnant women and 94% have been discharged home, including all the women with severe or critical disease (13) . While this is reassuring and confirms the prior data of less severe disease in women and younger patients (3), this is a very small sample size of pregnant women and extrapolations from this data should be made cautiously. When sex disaggregated data were collected during the H1N1 pandemic, it was clear that pregnant women were actually at a higher risk of contracting the virus, and as such, were aggressively offered the vaccine.",

Interestingly there are marked differences in the density of ACE2 receptors in the reproductive organs, the testis have much higher levels of ACE2 than the ovaries (15). On one hand, ACE2 serves as a gateway for the virus's entry into tissue. On the other hand, ACE2 serves an anti-inflammatory role and is thought to protect against lung injury.
