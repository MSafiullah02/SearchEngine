Anxiety was found to rise concomitantly with the level of pain experienced throughout labour in women of all personality types (Connolly et al., 1978). Spiby et al. (2003) stated that a hierarchy of methods, mainly focusing on coping with labour pain, might seriously limit women's psychosocial needs. Wuitchik et al. (1990) showed that anxiety could persist even after adequate pain relief was achieved. Morgan et al. (1977) concluded that, although analgesia was effective for pain relief, it could provoke anxiety and affect the birth experience.",

These include childbirth education (Brewin and Bradley, 1982), non-pharmacological and pharmacological pain-relief methods (Moir, 1973; Schuiling and Sampselle, 1999; Hodnett, 2002; Lowe, 2002), music therapy (Browning, 2002), support from midwives (Sigridur and Sigfridur, 1996) and significant others (Tarkka and Paunonen, 1996). However, the effectiveness of these methods remain inconclusive. Lowe (1996) has explained that how women express, manage and cope with labour discomfort is individual and dependent on a variety of factors. Recently, Gibbins and Thomson (2001) pointed out that maternal feelings of control during labour could be the most vital predictor of an enjoyable birth, and may help in decreasing the level of anxiety during pregnancy.",

They defined feelings of control as the sense of mastery over internal and environmental forces by personal initiation of choice that was self-actualising, active, responsible, creative and controlling one's own density. Recently, Green and Baston (2003) categorised the senses of control into three dimensions: control of what health-care professionals are doing, control of one's own behaviour and control during a contraction. It seems that this categorisation of control provides a more specific and measurable way for women and caregivers to evaluate control during labour.",

In evaluating the expected and experienced feelings of control of women during labour, Hodnett et al.

However, women had significantly higher Labour Agentry Scale (LAS) scores when they experienced continuous caregiver support (Hodnett and Osborn, 1989), spontaneous birth without continuous fetal heart monitoring (Hodnett, 1982) and decreased usage of pharmacological pain-relief measures (Hodnett and Abel, 1986). Moreover, Green et al. (1990) noticed that feelings of control during labour enhanced women's emotional well-being after labour, and these positive experiences persisted even though they were different from their expectation.",

In investigating the difference in choice and control as experienced by Chinese and Scottish childbearing women in Scotland, Cheung (2002) found that Chinese women preferred to give birth without medical intervention and to be well informed during labour. In contrast, a recent study (Ip et al., 2003) revealed that Chinese pregnant women had a strong expectation about the level of social support that should be provided by their nurses and partners during labour; however, their expectations of their own responsibilities towards how they coped with childbirth were relatively low.",

As a precautionary measure, no visitor was allowed to enter the hospital. The dominant model of care in the unit was medical and supported the active management of labour. This meant that most women had their labour induced or augmented; all women in labour abstained from food and drink, and received continuous electronic fetal monitoring. In addition, each woman was required to have 4-hourly and 2-hourly vaginal examinations, respectively, during the latent and active phases of their labour. The use of continuous fetal monitoring restricted women to a lateral position on the labour ward bed, and to give birth in the lithotomy position. Moreover, episiotomy was routinely carried out for every primigravida. Women at low risk were classified as a midwifery case according to the hospital protocol; this meant that women in labour were cared for by midwives without the involvement of an obstetrician unless a complication was detected. One midwife usually took care of more than one woman in labour at any given time. About 2 hrs after giving birth, women were transferred to a postnatal ward where a new team of midwives took care of them and their babies.",

Respondents were asked to rate each statement on a seven-point Likert scale from 1 (representing rarely) to 7 (representing almost always). Possible total scores for the LAS range from 29 (indicating feelings of control rarely) to 203 (reflecting feelings of control almost always). The reported internal consistency of the LAS ranges from 0.91 to 0.98 (Hodnett and Abel, 1986). Hodnett and Simmons-Tropea (1987) claimed that LAS scores remained stable at 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months postpartum. In the present study, the Chinese version of LAS (c-LAS) was used, which has demonstrated high internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.87, comparable to the previous findings reported by Law (2003).",

The insignificant differences between the recalled overall anxiety scores and anxiety scores during the active phase of labour may shed some light on the use of retrospective measures in studies that have difficulties in gaining access to the labour ward. Some previous investigators (Simkin, 1992; McCrea and Wright, 1999) have argued that the recall of labour experience might be subject to the \u2018halo\u2019 effect, as this was a recall of negative aspects of childbirth. Notwithstanding, Redelmeier and Kahneman (1996) suggested that it was impossible to retain every aspect of pain episode in memory, and the retention of a memory of pain at its worst may be maximally efficient. This theoretical explanation could be extended to recall anxiety level, and, as such, the postnatal assessed anxiety could represent a measure of anxiety at its most intense. More studies about anxiety of diverse cause are necessary before one can conclude that postnatally assessed anxiety does represent a measure of anxiety at its most intense.",

Besides environmental influences, the support of the caregiver is vital to the feelings of control in the women during labour. This was reinforced by Hodnett and Osborn (1989) who studied labouring women receiving continuous one-to-one caregiver support during labour. Hodnett and Osborn (1989) reported higher LAS mean score (151.3 SD=26.4) than the Chinese women during labour in the current study. This suggested that there would have been room for improvement in the current midwifery practice in Hong Kong, with the objectives for balancing economic constraints while providing quality care. Heavy reliance on a technological and medicalised approach to birth at the study unit may reflect that the administrative health policies do not value or understand the time intensiveness of being with women, and this may influence women's satisfaction and their postnatal health and well-being. Midwives are encouraged to initiate dialogue with obstetricians to look for ways of improving women's birth environment.",
