A Covid-19 specific assessment tool was developed locally, the 3D-Ticino 2019-nCov Score (3D-TiCoS), which focusses on key symptoms observed in this population, such as dypnoea, distress and discomfort (pain). The tool is depicted in Figure 1\n. Pressure areas are also assessed and the need for pressure relieving devices.",

Delirium is problematic, especially in combination with dementia, as it increases the contamination risk. Patients need sedation but due to limitations in availability of midazolam, creative solutions are employed using diazepam, chlorpromazine and levopromazine. Sedation is also used in the presence of haemoptysis, but haemoptysis is only experienced by a minority of patients6. Oxygen therapy and other futile treatments are stopped, and comfort care given. Oxygen in this context is not helpful to palliate symptoms, as it does not improve hypoxic patients\u2019 comfort, rather opioids are more effective7. In addition the mask can cause discomfort especially for patients with delirium. If possible a visit from the family is arranged. We would not recommend virtual contact with families using Skype or another online system as our experience is at this point as they find it too distressing.",

Most patients with Covid-19 need palliative care input due to the large symptom burden and need for clear and open communication with patients and their families. However, due to the potential for rapid deterioration, decisions need to be made quickly, and treatment plans need to be clear and simple to follow for the generalist staff caring for them. Care of patients with Covid-19 results in huge ethical dilemmas and a toll on the health care teams caring for them, not least from shortages in resources, both staffing and pharmaceutical. Palliative care needs to adapt to an emergency style of palliative care and be at the forefront to help make the best decisions, give care to families and find spiritual support.",
