Currently, the best understanding of these complex endotypes as mechanistic pathogenetic processes lays in their dualistic division as type 2 or non-type 2 asthma (Agache and Akdis, 2016) (Figure 1\nA). However, often endotypes can co-exist and/or include other mixed processes, which cannot be easily categorized (Kuo et al., 2017, Agache and Akdis, 2016, Cos\u00edo et al., 2017). Less well-defined forms of asthma, situated between clinical phenotypes and molecular endotypes, include inflammatory phenotypes of eosinophilic, neutrophilic, mixed, and paucigranulocytic asthma (Wang et al., 2011, Tan et al., 2019).",

These patients are usually allergic to common aeroallergens, have high blood eosinophilia, increased periostin, and high exhaled nitric oxide. They tend to respond well to treatment with glucocorticosteroids or novel biologicals, such as anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE), anti-interleukin-5 (IL-5), or anti-IL-4 and anti-IL-13 approaches (Castro et al., 2018, Corren et al., 2019). However, within high eosinophilic asthma, there are also those whose eosinophilia is resistant to steroid treatment and others with persistent severe asthma, who demonstrate a rapid decline in lung function, enhanced airway remodeling, and frequent exacerbations (Chung et al., 2014, Pavlidis et al., 2019). Mechanistically, type 2 inflammation engages T helper (Th) type 2 cells, type 2 innate lymphoid cells, T follicular helper cells, type 2 B cells, eosinophils, mast cells, and \u201csignature\u201d type 2 mediators including the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 as well as prostaglandin D2 (Ray and Kolls, 2017) (Figure 1B).",

Non-type 2 inflammation is characterized by infiltration of Th1 and Th17 cells and neutrophils, the presence of type I interferons, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and an IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17 signature (Rossios et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2017, Tan et al., 2019).

Therefore, it is not surprising that all surfaces of the human body, including the upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT), are populated with microbial communities. Yet, even upon initiation of the Human Microbiome Project in 2007 (Turnbaugh et al., 2007), lungs were not sampled, partially due to the existing dogma at the time that lungs are sterile. This dogma significantly delayed the initiation of studies on the lung microbiota relative to the gut microbiota (Dickson et al., 2016, Moffatt and Cookson, 2017) and likely persisted for several reasons: (1) healthy lungs were often not examined by invasive bronchoscopy techniques due to ethical concerns; (2) culture-based techniques were limited to known pathogens; and (3) bronchoscopy techniques were suspected to carry contamination from the oropharynx or nasal cavity. However, a pioneer publication using culture-independent 16S rRNA sequencing revealed differences in the microbial communities found in various locations of the healthy respiratory tract relative to those found in the respiratory tract of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Hilty et al., 2010). Numerous other studies confirming this observation have followed, elucidating the special role of the airway microbiota in health (Man et al., 2017) and disease (Wypych et al., 2019).",

The 70 m2 (Weibel, 1979) surface area of the human respiratory tract is inhabited by the microbiota, differing in quantities and qualities along the tract in response to niche-specific conditions (Man et al., 2017, Huffnagle et al., 2017). The movement of air and particles, including microbiota, in the respiratory system is bidirectional. The composition of the lung microbiome in each site is thus a consequence of the balance reached between migration to the airways, elimination from the airway, site-specific immune processes (e.g., presence or absence of inflammation) and the growth rates of the microbes (Huffnagle et al., 2017). Highlighting the role of the URT as a gatekeeper to respiratory health (Man et al., 2017), microbiota enter the lung mainly via microaspiration from the nasopharynx and the more densely and diversely populated oropharynx. Microbes can also enter the lung via dispersion along the mucosal surface (Bassis et al., 2015, Dickson et al., 2017).",

In addition to bacteria, several viruses and fungi have been found in the URT of healthy people. Human rhinovirus (RV), bocavirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, polymavirus, and Anneloviridae family viruses have been identified in the URT of large proportions of healthy asymptomatic children using PCR-based methods and metagenomics, even in geographically isolated locations (van den Bergh et al., 2012, Bogaert et al., 2011, Wylie et al., 2012, Altan et al., 2019). Detection frequency of these viruses in many studies is not different in the URT of asymptomatic controls and children hospitalized due to the respiratory tract infections, in contrast to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), and influenza, being causally associated with hospitalizations, lower respiratory symptoms, and pneumonia (Singleton et al., 2010, Sarna et al., 2018, Bhuiyan et al., 2019). These data suggest that in the cases of these \u201ccommonly carried\u201d URT viruses, not only their presence, but rather total viral load (Jansen et al., 2011) or complex interactions between viruses and bacteria (van den Bergh et al., 2012) or other environmental (e.g., allergen) and intrinsic host factors (e.g., sensitization) (Rubner et al., 2017) determine the occurrence of disease in the URT or LRT. Interestingly, in healthy adults these viruses are detected less frequently than in asymptomatic children, suggesting age-dependent and perhaps ecosystem-dependent changes in viral load of the URT (Sundell et al., 2019). Aspergillus, Penicillium, Candida, and Alternaria are fungal genera found in the URT of healthy people (Charlson et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The healthy microbiome of the URT and LRT plays several important roles in the development and maintenance of homeostasis of the RT and whole organism. The composition of the microbiome at all mucosal sites changes dynamically from the first days of life, shaping the establishment of proper interactions between the microbiota and human body and constituting the critical \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d for determining future health or disease (Pattaroni et al., 2018, Pammi et al., 2019, Stiemsma and Turvey, 2017). Directly after birth, the skin, gut, nasopharynx, and mouth microbial communities are undifferentiated and colonized by bacterial species reflective of delivery mode (de Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2015). During birth and in the first days of life, maternal vaginal and skin microbiota only transiently transfer to the infant, whereas the mother\u2019s gut microbiota becomes the primary source of microbial strains acquired by the baby by the age of four months (Ferretti et al., 2018, Yassour et al., 2018). The separation between the URT and LRT in the context of early life is important as these two anatomical sites represent different habitats. The URT experiences constant exposure to the external environment and its accompanying conditions from the first moment of life, which shapes the URT microbiota. However, it has been demonstrated that by 24 h after birth bacterial DNA can be detected in the LRT of neonates (Wypych et al., 2019). The transient nature of the LRT microbiota at the steady state is determined by the balance between microbiota that enter from the URT and microbiota that are eliminated by host immunity; therefore, URT samples cannot fully reflect on the interactions that occur in the LRT (Wypych et al., 2019). The healthy respiratory tract microbiome plays also important roles in conferring colonization resistance. The term \u201ccolonization resistance\u201d refers to the ability of a healthy and timely microbiota to actively suppress or compete with pathogens to inhibit their outgrowth, as has been shown in vitro (Bomar et al., 2016) and in vivo (de Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2019, Iwase et al., 2010).",

If the process of healthy and timely colonization is disrupted, early-life dysbiosis of the gut and lung microbiota becomes an important risk factor for the development of many respiratory diseases (Biesbroek et al., 2014, Teo et al., 2015). The mechanisms involved likely operate at different modes e.g., via inadequate training of host immunity (Gollwitzer et al., 2014), inefficient colonization resistance (de Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2019), and/or improper lung morphogenesis (Yun et al., 2014). During in utero development and later in life, there are several direct and indirect factors that affect healthy microbiota colonization and subsequent host-microbiota interactions. These factors include mother\u2019s health status (Stokholm et al., 2018), diet (Frei et al., 2012, Barcik et al., 2015), transfer of maternal antibodies and microbial molecules (Gomez de Ag\u00fcero et al., 2016, Koch et al., 2016), mode of delivery (Bosch et al., 2016), and breastfeeding and early-life environment (day care, siblings [Wolsk et al., 2016], pets at home [Sitarik et al., 2018, Tun et al., 2017], traditional farm-like dust at home [Stein et al., 2016, Kirjavainen et al., 2019], and smoking and antibiotic and other drug usage in pregnancy and early childhood [Mitre et al., 2018, Loewen et al., 2018]).",

            "text": "The human gut starts at the oral cavity, continues through the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and ends at the rectum. Its 150\u2013200 m2 enormous surface area provides microbes opportunities for colonization or transient occupation. Indeed, the human gut is inhabited by between 100 thousand and 100 billion bacteria per mL of luminal content depending on the region and therefore is the most densely colonized organ (Sender et al., 2016). Bacteria within the gut confer several functions to the host, including vitamin production, absorption of ions, protection against pathogens, histological development, enhanced immune functions, and fermentation of food (Hillman et al., 2017). They are typically dominated by five phyla; Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Tenericutes (Desai and Oppenheimer, 2016, Almeida et al., 2019), whereas Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Bifidobacterium are the most prevalent genera in healthy adults (Marsland et al., 2015). The oral cavity is mainly colonized by bacteria from the Streptococcaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Veillonellaceae, Prevotellaeace, and Neisseriaceae families and Gemella genus; the stomach mostly contains bacteria from the Lactobacillaceae family; the small intestine is dominated by Lactobacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Streptococcaceae; and the most densely colonized large intestine contains bacteria from the families of Enterococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, Fusobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Peptococcaceae, Prevotellaeace, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Rikenelleace, and the phylum Verrucomimicrobia (Hillman et al., 2017, Pereira and Berry, 2017). Candida, Saccharomyces, Malassezia, and Cladosporium are among the most commonly and consistently identified fungal genera in human gut mycobiota studies (Hoffmann et al., 2013, Strati et al., 2016, Auchtung et al., 2018, Mahnic and Rupnik, 2018, Iliev and Leonardi, 2017). Besides bacteria and fungi, the human gut microbiota is additionally composed of viruses (primarily phages) and archaea (mainly Methanobrevibacter smithii) (Lozupone et al., 2012).",

Inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which are part of the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue, are related in morphology and function, which includes the regulation of local immune responses (Elmore, 2006). The main immunological functions of GALT and iBALT include production and secretion of IgA at mucosal surfaces, as well as Th cell and cytotoxic (Tc) responses (Cesta, 2006). Regulation of local immunity in GALT occurs in Peyer\u2019s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. Terminal transformation of B cells to plasma cells able to secrete antibodies is finalized in the lamina propria, where memory and effector T and B cells reside. Importantly, 80% of activated B cells in adults are found in gut mucosal tissue (Brandtzaeg, 2010).",

In addition, the gut microbiota of patients with severe bacterial pneumonia (Chung, 2017), cystic fibrosis (Marsland et al., 2015), and influenza differs from that of healthy controls (Qin et al., 2015). Many studies show that early life is the most important period during which microbiota dysbiosis in the gut may lead to the development of many respiratory diseases, as the gut microbiota has a significant influence on immune cell maturation and resistance to pathogens (Sokolowska et al., 2018).",

Naive immune cells initially activated in the gut travel via lymph and blood vessels to the lung, where they have effector functions (He et al., 2017). Importantly, the local immune reaction in GALT and iBALT can influence systemic immune responses but the mucosal immune system can also act independently of the systemic site (Cesta, 2006). Interestingly, emerging evidence indicates that the gut-lung axis is bidirectional. For instance, stimulation of mouse lungs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes a significant increase in the number of bacteria in the gut (Sze et al., 2014), and it has been shown that pneumonia induces intestinal injury (Perrone et al., 2012) and decreases gut epithelial proliferation (Coopersmith et al., 2003) (Figure 2\n).",

One of the proposed mechanisms is that the liver can dampen the innate immune response by SCFAs binding to G-protein receptors or inhibiting the mevalonate pathway through HMGCoA reductase (Young et al., 2016). Furthermore, in a mouse model of pneumonia, it has been shown that cytokine expression in airspace macrophages was dependent on acute-phase protein (characteristic for hepatic acute-phase response) extravasation into the alveoli.

Moreover, soluble fiber supplementation has been found to decrease sputum eosinophilia and sputum histone deacetylase 9 gene expression in asthma patients (McLoughlin et al., 2019). In mice, SCFAs have been shown to increase the expression of the transcription factor FOXP3 via inhibition of histone deacetylation, thereby supporting the expansion of T regulatory cells (Tregs), and increasing the production of IL\u201010 (Arpaia et al., 2013). SCFAs have also been shown to reduce inflammation in both OVA and house dust mite (HDM)-induced airway inflammation models (Trompette et al., 2014, Cait et al., 2018). Moreover, oral application of SCFAs to mice during pregnancy and weaning have protect offspring from allergic lung inflammation, with butyrate in particular potently inducing Tregs in the lungs of offspring (Roduit et al., 2019) (Figure 2).",

The number of histamine-secreting bacteria is significantly higher in fecal samples of asthma patients compared with non-asthmatic volunteers (Barcik et al., 2019). In addition, the number of histamine-secreting bacteria correlates with disease severity. However, in a model of OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation, bacteria-derived histamine decreased total cell number in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BAL) and amounts of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in lung homogenate (Barcik et al., 2019), highlighting the complexity of bacteria-derived immune regulation. Conversely, intra-abdominal treatment of mice with 12,13-diHOME decreased the number of Treg cells in the lungs and increased pulmonary inflammation in a cockroach antigen mouse model of airway inflammation (Levan et al., 2019) (Figure 2).

In patients with severe asthma, a Th17 cell epithelial gene signature representing the non-type 2 asthma has been associated with increased representation of the phylum Proteobacteria, which further correlates with worsening of asthma control (Huang et al., 2015) and neutrophilic exacerbations of asthma (Ghebre et al., 2018). Klebsiella is one genus of bacteria within the Proteobacteria phylum enriched specifically in patients with severe asthma, whereas the phylum Actinobacteria correlates with improvement or no change is asthma control. Indicating the complexities of identifying cause-and-effect relationships, changes to microbial communities in the lungs may also result from asthma therapies. Actinobacteria, for instance, was associated with molecular evidence of response to steroids (FKBP5 expression) (Huang et al., 2015). Certain airway microbiota may therefore have the potential to be used as indicators of asthma responsive to steroids, allowing clinicians to refine the therapies. Importantly, the substantial additive effects of obesity and asthma severity on host immunological responses and the airway and gut microbiota have been recently described. Both obese and non-obese asthma patients with severe disease have reduced fecal levels of Akkermansia muciniphila, which may have a causal relationship as shown in murine models of acute and chronic airway inflammation (Michalovich et al., 2019). Another genus present in the lungs of patients with severe asthma is Streptococcus (Zhang et al., 2016, Budden et al., 2019).",

On the other hand, a study in mild asthmatics not treated with ICSs has demonstrated a unique enrichment in members of the Haemophilus, Neisseria, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas species and the Sphingomonodaceae family with concurrent depletion in members of the Mogibacteriaceae family and Lactobacillales in their airways (Durack et al., 2017).

Even if some immunological mechanisms of early-life protection have been described, there are probably many others. In addition, the immunological and molecular mechanisms of already established dysbiosis in adult asthma need to be characterized in more detail, ideally to reverse these processes. Moreover, further attention should be paid to understanding the connection between a patient\u2019s microbiome and response to asthma therapies, as these may influence one another. Microbial-derived mechanisms might be the reason of poor response to the treatment, as it has been elegantly demonstrated in vaccination (Hagan et al., 2019).

Although the mechanisms involved were not explored, two recent studies in human birth cohorts from the United States and Ecuador have identified fungal dysbiosis as a key feature of infant gut microbiota signatures associated with the development of high-risk asthma phenotypes in childhood (Fujimura et al., 2016, Arrieta et al., 2018). The specific signatures of fungal dysbiosis associated with asthma and related phenotypes differed in these studies, but it is notable that fungal dysbiosis was much more striking than bacterial dysbiosis in both studies. These results suggest that fungal dysbiosis may be a readily detectable biomarker of asthma risk. Moreover, both studies found that fungal dysbiosis co-associated with bacterial dysbiosis (Fujimura et al., 2016, Arrieta et al., 2018), calling for follow-up studies investigating both the microbial and immune mechanisms underlying these associations.",

Early studies in animal models aimed at establishing a causal link between fungal dysbiosis and asthma severity demonstrated that mice pre-treated with antibiotics are susceptible to fungal overgrowth following oral gavage with the common human gut commensal Candida albicans (C. albicans) (Noverr et al., 2004, Noverr et al., 2005). These mice further demonstrate exacerbated Th2 cell-mediated airway inflammation following airway challenge (Noverr et al., 2004, Noverr et al., 2005), an effect postulated to be mediated at least in part by the production of immunomodulatory prostaglandins by C. albicans (Noverr et al., 2001, Erb-Downward and Noverr, 2007). Congruent with this, overgrowth of another Candida species, C. parapsilosis, in the murine gut following antibiotic treatment has more recently been linked to prostaglandin PGE2-mediated polarization of lung macrophages to the M2 phenotype and exacerbated allergic inflammation following antigen sensitization and challenge. In this model, fungal overgrowth is correlated with inflammatory immune cell infiltration to the lung but also required specific antibiotic-induced changes to the bacterial microbiota. Only antibiotics causing reductions in the relative abundance of bacteria from the genus (among others) Lactobacillus are associated with fungal overgrowth and exacerbated airway inflammation following antigen challenge (Kim et al., 2014). Notably, Lactobacillus and other lactic acid-producing bacteria are of interest for their use as a probiotic to protect against asthma and allergy (Forsythe et al., 2007) and have known anti-fungal effects (Savage, 1969, Noverr and Huffnagle, 2004).",

Similarly, fungi-naive mice newly colonized with C. albicans demonstrate exacerbated AAD associated with systemic expansion of fungus-specific Th17 cells and IL-17-hyperresponsive neutrophils (Shao et al., 2019).

Continuous supplementation with three fungal species identified in this model to be overrepresented in the gut following antifungal treatment (Aspergillus amstelodami, Wallemia mellicola [sebi], and Epicoccum nigrum) (Wheeler et al., 2016, Li et al., 2018) or with Wallemia mellicola alone following antibiotic treatment (Skalski et al., 2018) similarly increases asthma severity (Figure 3) (Wheeler et al., 2016, Skalski et al., 2018). Antifungal treatment and the introduction of dysbiotic fungal communities to SPF mice in these studies results in changes to gut bacterial communities, including depletions of bacteria from the Lactobacillaceae family (Li et al., 2018, Skalski et al., 2018). However, the AAD-exacerbating effects of supplementation with a dysbiotic fungal community can be recapitulated in altered Schaedler flora mice without pre-treatment with antibiotics and in the absence of substantial changes to the bacterial microbiota (Li et al., 2018, Skalski et al., 2018). Furthermore, Li et al. (2018) recently demonstrated that direct sensing of antifungal-induced fungal dysbiosis by gut-resident CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocytes (Leonardi et al., 2018) increases numbers of Th2 cells in the lamina propria and is responsible for fungal dysbiosis-associated increased airway inflammation in a HDM model of AAD, independent of antifungal-associated changes to the bacterial communities (Li et al., 2018). Thus, in addition to having potential indirect effects on airway inflammation via restructuring of immunomodulatory gut bacterial populations or the production of systemic metabolites, asthma-associated fungal dysbiosis in the gut can have direct effects on host innate and adaptive immune cell populations.",

Subclinical colonization of the lungs with Pneumocystis at 2\u20135 months of age has been suggested to be one of the most common infections in infancy (Vargas et al., 2001, Vargas et al., 2005) and is associated with increased mucin gene expression (P\u00e9rez et al., 2014, Vargas et al., 2001, Vargas et al., 2005, Vargas et al., 2013, Rojas et al., 2019).

            "text": "Findings of altered fungal populations in the lungs of asthmatic patients are not surprising, as fungal components such as mannans, proteases (Porter et al., 2009), chitin, and \u03b2-glucans (Van Dyken et al., 2011) are often found in common human allergens and house dust. While the underlying mechanisms of sensitization remain unclear, many patients with severe and/or uncontrolled asthma are sensitized to fungi (Denning et al., 2014, Stern et al., 2008, Fraczek et al., 2018) and/or may show improvements in asthma symptoms following antifungal therapy (Chishimba et al., 2012, Denning et al., 2014). Lung fungi commonly associated with sensitization and asthma include those from the genera Aspergillus, Alternaria, and Cladosporium (Figure 3) (Denning et al., 2014, Fraczek et al., 2018). Interestingly, some evidence from animal models suggests that sensitization occurs secondary to the natural Th2 cell and eosinophilic immune response required for effective clearance of infection-causing fungi (Porter et al., 2009). Additionally, increased fungal load in BAL samples has been associated with corticosteroid therapy in patients with severe asthma with and without fungal sensitization (Fraczek et al., 2018). Thus, future work is needed to determine whether pathological fungal colonization and mycological dysbiosis of the lungs causes the onset of more severe asthma and occurs subsequent to severe asthma-associated corticosteroid treatment, and/or in response to asthma-associated changes in the lung microenvironment.",

Fungal-bacterial and fungal-host interactions both play an important role in determining the effects of fungal dysbiosis on host health. Much of this work has been done in pediatric birth cohorts and mouse models, calling for more studies into the relevance of the gut mycobiota to asthma in human adults. Furthermore, if and how early-life fungal dysbiosis influences the onset and/or severity of asthma later in life when the dysbiosis may no longer be present remains to be mechanistically tested.",

The long-term influence of RSV infection on asthma can be connected with fact that the virus typically affects neonates during lung development (Jartti and Gern, 2017). Neonatal regulatory B cells are highly permissive to RSV infection, and the frequency of this cell population can predict the severity of acute bronchiolitis (Zhivaki et al., 2017). Moreover, RSV rapidly adheres to human eosinophils and might be inactivated by these cells.

It has been also demonstrated that subcutaneous injection of HBoV-VP1u or B19V-VP1u proteins in OVA-sensitized mice resulted in elevated airway inflammation (Chiang et al., 2019). Finally, CMV DNA was detected in 51.4% of patients with recurrent wheeze and was more prevalent among those aged 12\u201336 months with a positive modified asthma predictive index (mAPI) than in those of the same age group with a negative mAPI (Sun et al., 2018).",

The presence of M. stadtmanae in stool samples from 6- to 10-year-old children has been associated in a dose-dependent manner with a reduced risk of being diagnosed with asthma (Barnett et al., 2019). This effect was independent of parental asthma status (Barnett et al., 2019). Only 8.3% of samples tested in this study were positive for M. stadtmanae, however, and certain archaeal proteins have actually been proposed to have pro-inflammatory (Blais Lecours et al., 2011) or allergenic properties (Bragin et al., 2018). Thus, more cohort studies and mechanistic studies into the immunomodulatory effects of gut archaea in the context of asthma are needed. As in the case of the other microbial communities discussed in this review, the microbial and immune context within which disrupted archaeal communities occur likely determine the ultimate immunological consequences for the host. Furthermore, as the human lung microbiota in childhood and adults continues to be characterized, the role of lung archaea in the dysbiosis-asthma paradigm will need to be determined.",

One important tool that will be helpful to understand mechanisms underlying the connection between the human microbiota and the immune system is humanized microbiota mouse models for allergic airway inflammation. Special attention should also be given to improving in vivo animal models to establish studies that mimic human clinical conditions as closely as possible. Currently, there are only two common mouse models of allergic airway inflammation: OVA and HDM-induced acute models, which reflect mainly type 2 asthma. Other models, utilizing high allergen doses or LPS, Chlamydia muridarum, Haemophilus influenzae, paramyxovirus, or RV1, usually in addition to allergen, partially reflect non-type 2 inflammation and should be used to complement OVA and HDM models (Tan et al., 2019, Kim et al., 2017).",

Recent analyses using currently available sequencing methods have allowed us to determine that microbial dysbiosis of the gut and lungs in airway inflammation is characterized by taxa-specific shifts in abundance at the family, genus, species, and even strain levels. These data clearly show that future studies should be more concentrated on specific changes of microbiota taxonomy, including strain differences, rather than at overall changes. On the other hand, global views of the microbiota and its correlations with host phenotypes should be taken into consideration. Studying isolated bacterial strains in the context of airway inflammation might have very different outcomes than if the same strains were investigated within a bacterial community. Moreover, more emphasis should be given to the detailed study of different parts of the human microbiota, including viruses, archaea, fungi, bacteriophages as well as parasites, and the possibility of global shifts or changes to inter-kingdom or inter-site microbial interactions within the microbiota in the context of asthma.",

Future studies should be extended to include several time points during a patient\u2019s life to determine whether changes to the earlier-life microbiota are connected to asthma development or preventions, or to an increase or improvement in airway inflammation. Importantly, longitudinal and prospective analyses of larger cohorts of patients are needed to understand the relationships between the course of the disease, its phenotype and endotype, susceptibility to disease progression, and response to treatment. Finally, considerable attention has and continues to be paid to early-life changes to the gut and lung microbiota and their influence on allergy symptoms later in life. While it is indisputable that early life is a very important period during which microbiome dysbiosis may lead to the development of immune-mediated diseases, we should also be able to answer the question: is it still possible to change, through modulation of the microbiota, allergic disease conditions later in life even if the early-life period was neglected?",

The two best-described asthma endotypes are the type 2 endotype, which includes mostly Th2 cell responses, and the non-type 2 endotype. However, endotypes can co-exist and/or include other mixed processes.
