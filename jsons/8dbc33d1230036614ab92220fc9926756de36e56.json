Coincident with a natural outbreak of MHV at our institution, we noted alterations in immunoglobulin secretion by mature Peyer's patch B cells under an inductive stimulus provided by dendritic cells and mitogen-activated T cells (DC-T). MHV was isolated from mice affected during the outbreak, and experimental infection of mice with the isolate consistently resulted in failures of immunoglobulin secretion by cocultures of Peyer's patch DC-T and B cells. In subsequent experiments, MHV appeared to negatively affect DC-T more than B cells. Therefore, the effects of inapparent MHV infection on experimental mucosal immune responses can result from natural infection and can be experimentally reproduced.",

Natural MHV infection recently has been reported to occur in over 70% of mouse populations in the United States (2, 3) and Canada (4) . Multiple studies have demonstrated alterations in immunologic parameters associated with MHV infection of mice (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . However, the interactions between MHV and the mouse immune system are not well understood, and the effects of the virus on mucosal lymphoid cells have not been studied previously. Because mucosal cells of the upper respiratory and intestinal tracts are primary sites of MHV infection (l), it is likely that encounters with lymphoid tissue at these sites are important early events in natural MHV infection.",

During studies of induction of mature B cells by DC-T from PP, alterations in immunoglobulin secretion were noted to coincide with a natural outbreak of MHV at our institution.

Experiments were performed using all four combinations of infected and uninfected cells. Data for immunoglobulin secretion are shown in Figs. 2 (IgM), 3 (IgG), and 4 (&A). Immunoglobulin secretion was generally lower in these crossed experiments. Although responses varied somewhat, MHV-infected DC-T, cultured with either infected or control B cells, generally secreted undetectable or very low concentrations of immunoglobulin of all three isotypes when compared with paired cultures of control DC-T for each experiment. However, infected B cells often produced significant immunoglobulin when cultured with control DC-T. In two cases (IgG in Experiment 3 and IgA in Experiment 4) infected B cells were induced to higher levels than paired control B cells, indicating that MHV infection did not impair B-cell function as consistently as it did DC-T function. In a single experiment, mice were inoculated with the isolate 3 weeks before PP collection. Immunoglobulin secretion (rig/ml) in cocultures from control mice was 200 IgM, 1780 IgG, and 780 IgA versus 160, 1340, and 490, respectively, for cocultures from MHV-infected mice.
