High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) plays a critical role in the evaluation and management of patients. In the appropriate clinical setting, characteristic HRCT findings may be diagnostic, obviating the need for open lung biopsy. In more challenging or complicated cases, consensus among the clinician, radiologist, and pathologist may be required. This chapter describes and depicts the characteristic HRCT features of usual interstitial pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, respiratory bronchiolitis, respiratory bronchiolitis associated interstitial lung disease, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia.",

The UIP pattern on HRCT consists of reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion in a patchy subpleural and bibasilar distribution ( Fig. 12.1) [11, 12] . These findings may be asymmetric but not unilateral. Honeycombing is a critical component of a confident, radiologic diagnosis of UIP (Figs. 12.2, 12.3). Honeycombing consists of clustered cystic spaces stacked upon a subpleural base. These cystic spaces have well-defined walls and typically range from 3 to 10 mm in size but may extend up to 2.5 cm in diameter [1, 5, 13] . Centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema may coexist with CT findings of UIP and should not be mistaken for honeycombing (Fig. 12.4) [8, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy is also common, typically involving the right paratracheal and subcarinal stations. The degree of lymphadenopathy typically correlates with the extent of parenchymal reticulation, although short axis lymph node measurements rarely exceed 1.5-2.0 cm in the absence of another superimposed cause [19, 20] . Ground-glass opacities can be associated with areas of fibrosis and may even represent regions of fibrosis. However, groundglass opacities should account for a relatively minor component of parenchymal abnormality.",

The severity and distribution of these parenchymal abnormalities are more uniform than in UIP. Distribution along the axial plane may be peripheral, peribronchovascular, or diffuse. When present and in the appropriate setting, a thin rim of subpleural sparing is a rather specific finding for NSIP and should heighten diagnostic confidence (Fig. 12.9 ) [43] . As with IPF, mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy is common, particularly at the right paratracheal and subcarinal stations, and correlates with the degree of parenchymal involvement. Given the high association of NSIP with underlying collagen vascular diseases and other disorders, associated abnormalities may be sought on available imaging studies.",

Finally, consensus among the clinician, radiologist, and pathologist may be required to establish a diagnosis when the pieces of the diagnostic puzzle are not straightforward. ",
