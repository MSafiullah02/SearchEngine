So when UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon gave the opening address in this Summit, the key message was \u201cHumanity has never faced a greater challenge than climate change\u201d. On the same occasion, Chinese Vice-Premier Zhang Gao-Li, representing Asia's largest contributor to CO2 emissions, made a response and promised that, \u201cWe will announce post-2020 actions on climate change as soon as we can to markedly reduce carbon intensity, increase the share of non-fossil fuels and raise the forest stock.\u201d (Sturmer, 2014).",

China's contribution was 23%, and Asia's contribution was 52% (Olivier et al., 2014). Asia's per capita CO2 emission, at 3.8 t, was still low when compared to North America at 17.5 t and Europe at 8 t (Friedrich and Damassa, 2014). However, the rapid development and urbanisation in Asia means a sharp increase in its per capita CO2, and inevitably, given its huge population, the total amount of CO2 it is going to emit is set to increase dramatically.",

In those tropical cities, the ambient air temperature in summer is expected to increase in the face of global warming, and extreme hot weather events will become more frequent. The number of hot nights will increase faster than those of hot days. It is easy for people to ignore the potential health impact of hot nights. Generally speaking, an increase of 2% heat stress related mortality may be expected for every 1 degree rise in air temperature beyond the threshold level (Chan et al., 2012). A major challenge for developed cities is that most of their infrastructure and building stock are already there. Transforming existing buildings or urban spaces to take on the new climatic challenges is not easy. The institutional inertia and financial burden of upgrading efforts are two of the most commonly encountered obstacles.",

Generally speaking, an increase of 5% to 10% in kWh of air conditioning energy use could be expected for every 1 degree rise in air temperature (Fung et al., 2006). More importantly, recent research has pointed to the \u201cswitching on\u201d of air conditioner behaviour when air temperature reaches a certain threshold (Frankel et al., 2013, Hong and Lin, 2013). When the threshold is crossed, the increase in energy use is dramatic. For tropical and sub-tropical cities, when the ambient air temperature, especially in the evening, is very close to this threshold, it only takes a degree or two of temperature increase to change people's energy use behaviour.",

Many tropical diseases, such as Dengue Fever, Malaria, and other intestinal diseases like Brothers Mouth Disease, that were once epidemic in tropical cities, would migrate northward (Gething et al., 2010). New diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), would appear more often.

On the one hand, extreme precipitation may cause more frequent landslides; this would affect settlements next to hillsides (Chiang and Chang, 2011). The risk is high due to the poor slope geo-technical management of many Asian cities; slope management is expensive. For example, Hong Kong, a small city territorially speaking, spends US$250 million per year to maintain and upgrade its 60,000 man-made slopes in or next to the city. On the other hand, extreme precipitation may also lead to flooding. Many Chinese cities have invested in and worked towards an update of their water drainage systems since 2013.

This means that when national and local governments draw up strategies in response to climate change, they must consider holistically with a long-term vision their commitment to greenhouse gas reduction, the impacts of climate change, levels of risks, the need to save energy, pollution control, and waste management (Meadowcroft, 2009, Ng, 2011, Bulkeley, 2010, Qi et al., 2008, Saavedra and Budd, 2009, USCOM, 2009, Zahran et al., 2008). With reference to the National Climate Change Policy in Asia, governments tend to treat each climate change impact individually to provide corresponding mitigation and adaption strategies. However, many governments in Asia do not seem to be fully aware of the strategies' potential, or ready to deal with the unpredicted climatic disasters, since their urban expansion is very often unplanned or has gone out of hand. For example, there is no evidence to suggest that any of them, when working on their climate change preparation, adopted the World Bank's Urban Risk Assessment (WB, 2011) as a framework, or other similar frameworks (e.g. Urban Climate Change Research Network's ARC3.2 city planning framework (Rosenzweig et al., 2015)).",

In 2014 at the UN Climate Summit, China committed to peaking its total CO2 emissions by 2030. This was in line with the earlier (November 2014) \u201cUS \u2013 China Joint Announcement on Climate Change and Clean Energy Cooperation\u201d. China has also set the goal of reducing its carbon intensity by up to 45% by 2020. How the promise is to be fulfilled remains a major question, but the most important fact is that China's CO2 emissions, given an annual growth rate of around 5%, will, in 2030, be roughly 22,000 Mts. Unfortunately, this number alone will make COP21\u2019s two-degree target impossible. In the meantime, there is currently no specialised legislation to supervise and address China's climate change (domestic) policy, although it was firstly suggested by Dahe Qin, the former Secretary of China's Meteorology Administration in 2009 (Chen, 2015). More importantly, a corresponding implementation mechanism system is still lacking (Chen, 2015). This is a decisive factor as to whether or not China's targets on climate change will be successfully achieved.",

            "text": "Given the ambiguity of power and duties regarding China\u2019 climate change (Chen, 2015), China has thus far focused only on mitigation. Adaptation measures and targets are needed and China is beginning to formulate them. However, so far there is no specialised legislation and corresponding implementation mechanism system to guarantee the proposed target can be realized. China's Policies and Actions for Addressing Climate Change published in 2011 reveals that the emphases are on water, health, land use, forestry, transport, air pollution, and industrial processes (IOSC, 2011). No specific target was set, and it is only mentioned that rises in sea levels will be analysed, and there are no corresponding detailed adaptation strategies. Subsequently, in 2013, a set of revised policies was published (NDRC, 2013). The five highlights are:1.Disaster Prevention and Mitigation: The Ministry of Civil Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Water Resources now work closely together to build defensive infrastructure for extreme weather. Above all else is the production of flood risk maps and assessment mechanisms. However, given the vastness of China's territory, the task is challenging.2.Monitoring and Early Warning: The China Meteorological Administration and the State Oceanic Administration are charged with providing the needed early warning and monitoring mechanisms.3.Agriculture and Water Resources: The Outline of National Agricultural Water Conservation (2012 \u2212 2020) promotes water-saving agriculture. Strictest Water Resources Management Systems have been developed for river basin protection.4.Coastal Areas and Ecosystems: Overseen by the State Oceanic Administration, the coastal defences are being reinforced. The long coast lines and cities on or near the flood plains are the key challenges. A report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reckons that a number of Chinese cities, including Guangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Qingdao, are ranked in the top 20 most vulnerable cities (Pan et al., 2011).5.Public Health: The impact of climate change on public health in the form of heatwaves has not been explicitly mentioned. Safe drinking water and PM2.5 are the focuses.\n",

It is found that there is a linear trend of increasing haze events per year from 1960 to 2010 (Sun et al., 2014). Recent studies also demonstrate that there has been an explosive increase in haze events especially since 2000. In some extreme haze cases, the affected areas made up as much as 15% of the land in China (Wu et al., 2014), and the visibility distance was reduced to less than 1 km (Wu, 2011). Mitigating air pollution and improving urban ventilation have become the will of the people. Controlling air pollution emission sources means industrial transformation, and clean and green energy use. This is one of the biggest challenges, since economic growth is still the main pursuit for both central and local governments. Thus, improving urban ventilation by creating air corridors has become the first choice for politicians in the mitigation of air pollution, as they also help demonstrate their performance in the improvement of living quality (Ren, 2016).",

The need for technical and professional understanding of the urban climate is well documented in Grimond's and Mill's seminal papers presented in the World Climate Conference 3 gathering in Geneva in 2009 (Grimmond et al., 2010, Mills et al., 2010). China is beginning to amass the technical knowledge of how to gather data and generate scientific understanding. This area of capabilities as Grimond et al. have outlined in their 2010 paper is not that difficult to acquire. However, the challenge lies in the institutional translation of technical understanding into policy and action. Mills et al. have put together in their 2010 paper the framework and checklist for policy makers and professionals. However, there is still plenty of room for improvement in China's multi-layer bureaucratic governance structure and professionalism to actually push things forward.",

The task fell on the Public Works and Transport Bureau (DSSOPT). Commissioned by DSSOPT, researchers developed the GIS-based urban climatic maps of Macau (Fig. 5\n) (Gong et al., 2015, Ren et al., 2015). A 10-year high resolution (100 m \u00d7 100 m grid) wind field study was conducted using WRF and CALMET (Yim et al., 2007). In addition, a large domain fine grid LES study was conducted to test the wind flow characteristics of the territory with and without the land reclamation (Fig. 6\n) (Keck et al., 2014).

The call has been echoed by Professor Gerald Mills and his co-authors (Mills et al., 2010). Two fundamental qualities of the needed information are their \u201ccriticality\u201d and that they are \u201cprevailing\u201d (Mills, 2006, Ng, 2012). It is important to cross the river by feeling the stones \u2013 that is to say, there must be monitoring and feedback mechanisms in place to allow achievements to be measured, and more importantly, adjustments to the course to be made. When it comes to policy, the benefits must be beyond the environment. Economists have a role to play here especially when one is dealing with a capitalist economy. The short-term and the long-term payback and cost benefits must be quantified and communicated. In addition, sociologists are needed to help elaborate the qualitative and community benefits to the society. A win-win situation may not be found all the time, but there must be platforms that allow trade-offs and the balancing act to be negotiated among various parties.",

Premier Xi's \u201cblue sky, green mountains and clean water\u201d provides the much needed political impetus for recent actions. A few pilot projects have been attempted and a number of lessons have been learnt. This paper highlights three needs: (1) urban data, (2) a cross-disciplinary impact assessment, and (3) the development of a market and policy transformation mechanism. As China's urban transformation unfolds and more projects are attempted, it is certain that more needs and obstacles will be uncovered.",

Cities and buildings need to be adapted or re-designed. Changing the city's infrastructural layout and provisions is a long process.
