Six stopped hydroxychloroquine therapy early due to either being transferred to the intensive care unit (n = 3), leaving the hospital (n = 1), death (n = 1), or nausea (n = 1). On day 6 of treatment, 70% of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were virologically cured compared with only 12.5% in the control group (P = 0.001). The addition of the macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin, to hydroxychloroquine was significantly more effective for virus elimination with a 100% cure rate, suggesting this combination may be superior to hydroxychloroquine alone. The same authors have published a preprint21 of a larger sample (n = 80) of patients who received the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin showing clinical improvement in all but 2 patients. The authors report that only 15% of subjects required oxygen therapy, 93% had a negative nasopharyngeal viral load on day 8, and the length of stay was limited to an average of 5 days. Despite the favorable outcomes reported in these observational studies, a proper randomized controlled trial is warranted before any definitive decisions can be made regarding the role of these therapies in treating COVID-19.",

The primary risks of tocilizumab relate to immunosuppression through neutropenia and interruption of T-cell-mediated immunity. Infusion reactions and transient transaminase elevations may also occur frequently. Although tocilizumab significantly increases cholesterol levels and blood pressure, a recent network meta-analysis found the cardiovascular risk with tocilizumab was comparable with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.44 Regardless, given the high mortality rate among patients with COVID-19\u2013mediated ARDS (>50%), the potential benefits of short-term tocilizumab use seem to outweigh risks of treatment for most patients.",

It also seems that SARS-CoV-2 consumes ACE2 and increases angiotensin2 (AT2) activity, which activates an inflammatory response resulting in microvascular constriction and ischemic injury.48 Moreover, the SARS-CoV led to downregulation of ACE2 and more severe lung injury in mice, which could theoretically be attenuated by administration of an ARB.49 Mice lacking ACE2 have also been shown to have worse outcomes with influenza H7N9 infection.50 Observational evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors, but not ARBs, may reduce the risk of pneumonia.51 Given the limited data available supporting either harm or benefit, multiple professional organizations have released statements to provide guidance. A Joint Statement from the Heart Failure Society of America, American Heart Association, and American College of Cardiology recommends, \u201cnot to add or remove any RAAS-related treatments, beyond actions based on standard clinical practice,\u201d and calls for further research in this area.52 Likewise, the Council on Hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology also released a Position Statement recommending, \u201cphysicians and patients should continue treatment with their usual antihypertensive therapy because there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACEi or ARBs should be discontinued because of the COVID-19 infection.\u201d53",

This is particularly true given the higher mortality rates observed in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular and cardiometabolic comorbidities. As previously discussed, however, dose reductions or therapy substitutions may be warranted if patients receive lopinavir/ritonavir treatment while on statin therapy (Table 1).

Options include the use of telehealth to conduct brief, focused remote visits, or postponement of visits for more stable patients. Regardless, there are some additional considerations for managing these patients. Home blood pressure monitoring devices, weight scales, heart failure telemonitoring, and other remote equipment should be offered, when possible, to augment telehealth visits. Such equipment may require training of the patients and health care providers but also may reveal unequal access to such resources. Reinforcing heart healthy lifestyle and stress management are also important given the inherent impact of social distancing and quarantine during a pandemic on daily routines and mental health. Additional medication-related considerations include ensuring patients have sufficient refills and prescribing a longer supply for maintenance medications. These represent some of the potential challenges of social isolation during the pandemic.",

Although no approved therapies currently exist, multiple collaborative efforts are underway to identify effective therapies and a vaccine to prevent future infection. Cardiovascular clinicians, however, may not be accustomed to the concomitant use of antivirals and immunomodulators in their patients; thus, the need to understand how these therapies might impact underlying cardiovascular conditions and medications. Despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, there is an immense opportunity to enhance our understanding of how to prevent and treat such emerging infections as well as improve our understanding of the relationship between infection, immune response, and cardiovascular disease.",

In patients with COVID-19, an increase in metabolic demand occurs along with a progressive decrease in cardiac contractility and cardiac reserve, which are responsible for the acute cardiovascular complications, or decompensation, of chronic cardiovascular disorders. As well, COVID-19 is characterized by a severe systemic inflammation, which has a procoagulant effect and may pave the way to thrombotic events or impair the immune response leading to myocardial injury. Interestingly, individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or diabetes are at higher risk to develop a more aggressive, potentially life-threatening disease. Currently, available drugs that are under evaluation may have important implications for cardiovascular health care providers as many of these agents have significant drug\u2013drug interactions and cardiovascular-related side effects, both acute and chronic.

Preventative approaches are critical to prevent person-to-person spread and include social and physical distancing and proper hygiene. Patients who are COVID-19 positive but are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms should self-quarantine for 2 weeks and receive supportive care at home so as not to overburden the health care system. Patients with more severe illness (eg, worsening shortness of breath) may receive one of several investigational therapies and oxygen therapy. A minority of patients will require intensive care and ventilation and may be appropriate candidates for therapies aimed at preventing cytokine storm to blunt the inflammatory response.",
