            "text": "Allergic inflammation appears to be the first and primary occurrence in the chain of events leading to asthma and other airway disorders. Chemical mediators released during hypersensitivity reactions give rise to the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, and induce the cell infiltration and activation that results in chronic inflammation. A key event in this process is the upregulation of specific intercellular adhesion molecules, including members of the immunoglobulin superfamily intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-l), that permits inflammatory cells to migrate into nasal, sinus, and lung tissue. In certain conditions, inflammatory mediators stimulate the expression of ICAM-1, which is also a receptor for the subtype of human rhinoviruses that accounts for 90% of human rhinovirus infections. It is currently under investigation that allergen exposure and viral infection in the first 3 years of life may alter pulmonary and immune function irreversibly in genetically predisposed children. * Moreover, these same mechanisms may contribute to other respiratory problems associated with eosinophilic inflammation, lymphoid hyperplasia, mucosal edema, and viral infection.",

They are the first choice for treating nasal blockage and largely reduce, but may not eliminate, the need for other medications to treat ocular symptoms. They may be used safely in children, though youngsters often have difficuIty with sprays. In addition to treating nasal allergies, these medications can be used to treat nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) and to shrink small nasal polyps or prevent their recurrence after surgery. The onset of action of topical corticosteroids is slow compared to antihistamines. Topical nasal decongestants may be used to open nasal passages in preparation for the use of other agents, such as intranasal steroids. To prevent rebound congestion, they should be used for 2 to 3 days and no more than 7 to 10 days. Mast-cell stabilizers include intranasal cromolyn and nedocromil sodium. Cromolyn may be used for the prophylaxis of allergic symptoms, and is considered especially safe for elderly patients, children, and pregnant women. The need for frequent administration can raise compliance issues. Nedocromd sodium, unlike cromolyn, can both prevent an allergic reaction and control a reaction in progress. Topical antihistamines allay allergen-induced itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and ocular symptoms but are less useful for nasal blockage. Intranasal anticholinergics such as ipratropium bromide are effective in controlling the excessive watery rhinorrhea associated with neurogenic stimuli (e.g., cold air, spicy foods) or the common cold. However, they have no effect on nasal blockage, sneezing or itching, or ocular symptoms.",

This would reduce overall morbidity and improve patients' quality of life. It also should help make patients less vulnerable to the consequences of viral infection, as well as to environmental factors such as pollution.

In addition, some of the hewer agents have been shown to possess antiallergy properties that may contribute to diagnosis and treatment. These properties include the ability to: inhibit histamine release from human basophils block histamine, and partly block prostaglandin D, release, in the nasal secretions of highly allergic subjects (61) directly inhibit eosinophil activation (62, 63) block histamine activation of airway epithelial cells by suppressing the expression of surface markers, such as ICAM-1, and the major histocompatibility complex class I1 antigen HLA-DR, involved in antigen presentation (27) . The ability both to inhibit histamine release and downregulate ICAM-1 makes certain anthistamines (e.g., terfenadine [65, 66] , loratadine [27] , cetirizine [65] , azelastine [65] , oxatomide [65] , and levocabastine [65] particularly suitable for treating allergic inflammation, because ICAM-1 is a marker of allergen-induced inflammation as well as a receptor for human rhinoviruses (33, 65) . (59, 601 reduce vascular permeability (64) Sedating vs nonsedating antihistamines. \"Sedating\" agents are distinguished from \"nonsedating\" ones by the higher incidence of drowsiness associated with the former at the doses used to control allergic ,symptoms. In part, this difference is due to the speed with which antihistamines cross the bloodbrain barrieri.e., rapidly in the case of the sedating agents and slowly in the case of the nonsedating agents. The sedative potential of the newer agents is limited further by their specificity for binding to peripheral HI-receptors. Sedating antihistamines, in contrast, affect central HI-receptors and receptors of other types (e.g., muscarinic cholinergic, a-adrenergic, and tryptaminergic) (67) . This may contribute to their sedative and other side-effects (67) . Sedating agents' effect on central HI-receptors may be especially relevant, as hstaminergic transmission originating from the posterior hypothalamus sustains waking arousal (68) . In short, by having a reduced capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier and specifically blocking HIreceptors, the nonsedating agents are less able to cause CNS effects and associated adverse reactions.",

However, it is unwise to depend upon tolerance to abolish the antihistamine- induced sedation and performance impairment that commonly occurs for at least 1 week after the medication is started (86) . It is generally agreed that tolerance is a highly idiosyncratic phenomenon that is not universal, complete, or predictable. Virtually all antihistamines are equally effective in relieving allergy symptoms (see \"Efficacy\" section). Consequently, before recommending a particular antihistamine, physicians must weigh the benefits of that agent against its drawbacks. The lower cost of the older \"sedating\" antihistamines, and their general availability without prescription, may argue in their favor, but their use can no longer be recommended. The nonsedating agents offer the potential long-term benefits of safety and improved performance at work or in school compared to sedating antihistamines, and greater therapeutic compliance owing to their longer half-life and the need for less frequent dosing (81, 82) .",

Unfortunately, one's subjective sense of sleepiness or impairment is an unreliable gauge of whether it is safe to operate heavy machinery while taking sedating antihistamines. This is because impairment can occur without the patient's awareness (87, 88) . These factors have important safety implications in areas such as building consltuct ion, manufacturing, pub1 ic transpottation, and automobile driving. Simulated and real-life driving studies verify that these agents Carl impair performance significantly (87, 89, 90) . In one study, lane weaving by drivers given triprolidine 10 mg (emtamed release), was comparable to that ib perS6hS with a blood alcohol level of 0.05%; moreover. at 3-4 h after drug use, the drivers stopped feporting any sense of being impaired (87) (Fig. 4) . Another study found that the effects of a single 10-mg dose of cetirizine resembled those of alcohol (72 g/kg lean body mass), and that the impairment appeared to be greater when alcohol and cetirizine were taken together (91) (Fig. 5) . By contrast, no psychomotor deficits have been observed in drivers given loratadine (87, 91) , or in individuals tested while taking astemizole (92); nor does the use of alcohol with these agents produce an additive effect. Studies have also shown that terfenadine did not impait psychomotor performance or reaction time (65) , and that ebastine at 10, 20, or 30 mg given for 5 days did not impair driving performance compared to triprolidine 10 mg (93).",

Two nonsedating agentsterfenadine and astemizolehave been found to cause malignant ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes (103, 104), when patient factors or drug interactions result in greatly elevated serum drug levels (105, 106). Although rare, these phenomena can delay cardiac repolarization and prolong the QT interval through blockage of a K rectifier channel, resulting in possible sudden death. At least 11 case reports involving 20 patients have been published in which patients taking astemizole experienced torsades de pointes, QT prolongation, and sometimes other cardiac effects (67) . Eight such reports affecting 22 patients have appeared for terfenadine (67) . Acrivastine, cetirizine, fexofenadine and loratadine appear to be the least likely of the newer antihistamines to be arrhythmogenic (67) . The risk of cardiac arrhythmias can be minimized by reviewing the medical and pharmacologic risk factors for torsades de pointes before prescribing terfenadine or astemizole for any individual. Drug interactions associated with the potential for cardiotoxicity are a major concern of clinicians, as patients frequently fail to report all of the medications they are tdking. Concomitant administration of certain antifungal agents (especially ketoconazole and itraconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (patticularly erythromycin), along with terfenadine or astemizole, inhibit metabolism of these two antihistamines through competition for hepatic P450 enzymes. This results in increased plasma cohcentrations of these antihistamines. Coadministratiori of terfenadine or adtemiztde in users of such medications is thus sttictly contraindicated.

Current recommendations are to consider SIT for a broader range of patients (see Table 6 ). SIT, unlike pharmacotherapy, modifies the immune system and plays a preventive role in asthma development.

The efficacy of SIT for Table 6 Specific immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis 1142) grass pollen, ragweed pollen, and house-dust mites is very well established (141, 142) . Results are best when the patient has a single allergic sensitivity rather than allergies to multiple substances. It must be stressed, however, that SIT should be undertaken only by physicians working in facilities equipped to handle possible adverse reactions (urticaria, laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis). Although its safety under these conditions is good, a careful riskhenefit analysis is required for each patient before injections commence. Some experts believe that children may be especially responsive to SIT (142) .

Presence of dogs as household pets and serum IgE exceeding 100 IU/ml were significant risk factors for development of atopic (vs nonatopic) allergic rhinitis (1 1). Wheezing in infancy usually implies no increased risk of asthma or allergies, but for the minority (14%) of children in whom wheezing persists at age 6, this symptom may signal a predisposition to asthma (144) . A prospective study following 826 children from birth to age 6 years found that risk factors for persistent wheezing were elevated serum IgE at 9 months old and a maternal history of asthma (144) .
