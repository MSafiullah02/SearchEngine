By April 2014, he and his team had established an Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia, Liberia. In July 2014, he woke up feeling feverish and tired. He measured his temperature and found that he was slightly febrile with a temperature of 37.8 \u00b0C when measured through a thermometer placed in the mouth (the normal temperature is 37.4 \u00b0C). He informed his colleagues of his illness and stayed at his local residence in Liberia. Two rapid malaria tests were negative for identification of malaria infection. With the passage of time, his fever got worse, heightening to a body temperature of 38.6 \u00b0C. He also felt nauseated.",

This time, the test demonstrated that he had Ebola virus disease. It is not uncommon for initial tests to be negative in very early Ebola virus infection because the amount of virus is too small to be detected in the blood.1\n",

The communications between defending units remained sporadic and ineffective. When the defending armies responded with massive artillery barrage, but without clear targets, the damage inflicted upon their own comrades exceeded the damage suffered by the invaders.

Coagulation requires a combination of circulating proteins and adequately functioning blood cells called platelets. Platelets are specialized cells that function to prevent bleeding in the body. Ebola virus infection macrophages also produce some chemicals medically known as cytokines. Cytokines also induce production of tissue factors. Cytokines and tissue factors cause inappropriate and false activation of platelets and other proteins that are involved in blood clotting. This false activation leads to blood clotting that ultimately consumes a lot of platelets and other proteins. Due to depletion of platelets and proteins involved in normal clotting process, the body becomes prone to excessive bleeding and hemorrhages. As the disease progresses, liver injury may also cause a decrease in plasma levels of certain coagulation factors. This whole sequence is called disseminated intravascular coagulation.",

Patients who do not have symptoms of infection but are in their incubation period are not believed to transmit infection. However, there is clear evidence that virus can be communicated to other people from a symptomatic patient; therefore, precautions must be taken against exposure if a person is symptomatic with Ebola virus infection.6 The clinical manifestation of Ebola virus disease starts with nonspecific influenza-like symptoms and progresses into a life-threatening picture with the involvement of multiple bodily functions and organs. The most common signs and symptoms reported from West Africa during the 2014 outbreak included diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and anorexia or lack of appetite.2\n",
