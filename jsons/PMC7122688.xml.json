The characteristic cup-shaped structures on the surface of the virions are more prominent in some strains, particularly in sapoviruses, leading to the characteristic six-pointed \u201cstar of David\u201d appearance when viewed along the major two-, three- and fivefold axes of symmetry. Cloning and expression of norovirus proteins VP1 and VP2 in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system resulted in the self-assembly of the viral capsid and the production of recombinant virus-like particles (rVLPs) that were antigenically and structurally similar to native virions (Jiang et al. 1992; Green et al. 1997; Hale et al. 1999; Kobayashi et al. 2000).",

This analysis showed that the virus particles (38 nm in diameter by this technique) have a distinct architecture and exhibit T = 3 icosahedral symmetry (Fig. 3.2). The capsid contains 180 copies of the capsid protein assembled into 90 dimers with an arch-like structure. The arches are arranged in such a way that there are large hollows at the icosahedral five- and threefold positions; these hollows are seen as cuplike structures on the surface of caliciviruses (Prasad et al. 1994; Prasad et al. 1996a; Prasad et al. 1999). To form a T = 3 icosahedral structure, the capsid protein has to adapt to three quasi-equivalent positions; the subunits located at these positions are conventionally referred to as A, B and C. The high resolution (3.4 \u00c5) structure of the Norwalk virus capsid has been determined by X-ray crystallography (Prasad et al. 1999).\n",

The P2 subdomain is the most variable region of the capsid protein among NoVs (Hardy et al. 1996) and plays an important role in immune recognition and receptor interaction. It has been shown that isolated P domains form dimers and bind to histo-blood group antigens (HBGA) without requiring the formation of VLPs (Tan et al. 2004). In addition, a binding pocket in the P domain is responsible for viral HBGA-binding and the formation of this pocket involves only intramolecular interactions (Tan et al. 2003). Although the S domain has a canonical 8-stranded \u03b2-barrel structure, the P2 subdomain has a fold similar to that observed in domain 2 of the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), a structure never seen before in a viral capsid protein (Prasad et al. 1999). Moreover, the fold of the P1 subdomain is unlike any other polypeptide observed so far (Bertolotti-Ciarlet et al. 2003).",

            "text": "As mentioned above, all caliciviruses have a linear, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 7.5\u20137.7 kb (Green et al. 2001) (Fig. 3.1). The RNA genome of Norwalk virus, the prototype strain for the genus Norovirus, is 7654 nucleotides in length and is polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end (Jiang et al. 1993b). The lack of a cap structure typical of eukaryotic mRNA and the absence of an internal ribosomal entry site suggest that the VPg protein may function in translation initiation through unique protein-protein interactions with the cellular translation machinery (Daughenbaugh et al. 2003). The genomes of caliciviruses are organized into either two or three major ORFs with the exception of MNV, which has a fourth alternative ORF (McFadden et al. 2011). The nonstructural proteins encoded in the calicivirus ORF1 were first predicted based on sequence similarities with picornavirus nonstructural proteins (Neill 1990). Amino acid sequence motifs in common with the poliovirus 2C NTPase, 3C protease, and 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) were readily identified and provided templates for further characterization of the calicivirus nonstructural proteins. Proteolytic mapping and enzymatic studies of in vitro-translated polyprotein or recombinant protein expression has confirmed the presence of an NTPase (p41), a 3C-like protease (3CLpro), an RdRp, and the location in the polyprotein of the genome-linked protein VPg (Liu et al. 1996; Dunham et al. 1998; Pfister and Wimmer 2001). The proposed six nonstructural proteins encoded in the norovirus ORF1 defined so far proceed from N to C terminus, p48-NTPase-p22-VPg-3CLpro-RdRp (Ettayebi and Hardy 2003). It has been reported that the 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) inhibits host cell translation by cleavage of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which is a key protein involved in the translation of polyadenylated mRNAs (Kuyumcu-Martinez et al. 2004). Functional analysis of the protein produced from MNV ORF4 demonstrated that it antagonizes the innate immune response to infection by delaying the upregulation of a number of cellular genes activated by the innate pathway, including IFN-beta (McFadden et al. 2011).",

Viruses in the genera Sapovirus and Lagovirus have two major ORFs (ORF1 and ORF2). In the Sapovirus genera, the ORF1/2 junction consists of a one- or four-nucleotide overlap between the stop codon of ORF1 and the first AUG codon of ORF2. A third ORF has been described in certain strains that overlaps with the capsid protein gene in a +1 frameshift and is not found in the Norovirus genome (Liu et al. 1995; Clarke and Lambden 2000). The presence of a conserved translation initiation motif GCAAUGG at the 5\u2032 end of this overlapping ORF suggests that a biologically active protein may be encoded in this ORF (Schuffenecker et al. 2001).",

            "text": "Viruses in the genera Norovirus and Vesivirus have three major ORFs (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3). In the noroviruses the first and third ORFs are in the same reading frame. In Norwalk virus, ORF3 encodes a 212-amino-acid minor structural protein of the virion (Glass et al. 2000a). All calicivirus genomes begin with a 5\u2032-end terminal GU, which is repeated internally in the genome and most likely correspond to the beginning of a subgenomic-sized RNA transcript (2.2\u20132.4 kb) that is co-terminal with the 3\u2032 end of the genome. This has been observed in FCV- and RHDV-infected cells as well as in packaged virions (Herbert et al. 1996a). A comparison of the 5\u2032-end sequences of representative viruses within each of the four genera and the corresponding repeated internal sequence suggests this feature is characteristic of the caliciviruses. The synthesis of a subgenomic RNA in calicivirus-infected cells is a major difference between the replication strategy of caliciviruses and picornaviruses, although several of the replicative enzymes share distant homology (Green et al. 2001). Calicivirus structural proteins are expressed from a subgenomic mRNA with two overlapping cistrons. The first ORF of this RNA codes for the major capsid protein VP1, while the second codes for the minor capsid protein VP2. Translation of VP2 is mediated by a termination/reinitiation mechanism, which depends on an upstream sequence element of approximately 70 nucleotides denoted \u201ctermination upstream ribosomal binding site\u201d (TURBS). Two short sequence motifs within the TURBS were found to be essential for reinitiation (Luttermann and Meyers 2009).",

            "text": "By functional analysis of the 5\u2032 genomic sequence of Jena virus, a bovine norovirus, the N-terminal encoding genomic sequence was tested for IRES-like function in a bi-cistronic system but displayed no evidence of IRES-like activity (Salim et al. 2008). Alignment of the N-terminal protein sequences of various noroviruses showed little similarity between genogroups within the first 180 residues; however, towards the C-terminal end of the protein, similarity between the amino acid residues increased. Recent studies investigating the functions of the Norwalk virus N-terminal protein have successfully demonstrated its association with the Golgi apparatus in transfected cells (Fernandez-Vega et al. 2004). Other studies have suggested that the Norwalk virus N-terminal protein disrupts intracellular protein trafficking, including proteins destined for the host cell membrane (Ettayebi and Hardy 2003). A 3C protease-mediated cleavage event within the N-terminal protein (37 kDa) was described for Camberwell virus, a genogroup 2 norovirus, yielding proteins of 22 and 15 kDa (Seah et al. 2003). Based on these observations and location within the genome it was hypothesised that the N-terminal protein of noroviruses corresponds to the 2AB region in picornaviruses. After expression of the structural proteins from subgenomicRNA molecules, the capsid is assembled and viral RNA is encapsidated prior to progeny release. Some of these features have been confirmed using recombinant systems to express the native Norwalk virus genomes in mammalian cells using vaccinia virus expression systems (Asanaka et al. 2005; Katayama et al. 2006).",

            "text": "Early studies demonstrating variability in NoVs soon led to the notion that it was important to distinguish between strains to better understand their epidemiology. Since no antigenic analysis of norovirus strains was available due to the lack of immune reagents, genome characterization by sequence analysis has been used to provide an interim system of genotyping (Koopmans et al. 2003). As the genotypes ideally would correlate with serotypes, the amino acid sequence of the major structural protein was used as the basis for phylogenetic analyses (Ando et al. 2000; Koopmans et al. 2001). Noroviruses encompass six distinct genogroups (GI-GVI) with GI, GII and GIV infecting humans, which are further divided into >30 genotypes (Zheng et al. 2006; Vinj\u00e9 2015) (Table 3.1). Genogroups were defined on the basis of amino acid diversity of the 3 ORFs, the RdRp and VP1 encoding regions, or the VP1 encoding region alone. Current classification into six genogroups is based on the VP1 protein divergence (Green et al. 2000; Vinj\u00e9 et al. 2004; Zheng et al. 2006; Vinj\u00e9 2015). Genotypes are defined on the basis of either the polymerase or the capsid sequence, assuming that the genotype defined by one region of the genome would correspond to the whole genome because of the non-segmented nature of the norovirus genome (Vinj\u00e9 and Koopmans 1996; Kageyama et al. 2004; Vinj\u00e9 et al. 2004). New genotypes were assigned when VP1 amino acid sequence differed by more than 20 % with other known genotypes (Vinj\u00e9 et al. 2000). However, with the accumulation of more norovirus sequence data, this cutoff threshold has been changed to 14.1 % and a minimum of 15 % pairwise difference between the next-nearest genotype for the proposal of a new norovirus genotype (Zheng et al. 2006; Kroneman et al. 2013).\n",

            "text": "The recognition that recombination often occurs at the ORF1/ORF2 junction, has necessitated the determination of both polymerase and capsid gene sequences to fully describe the genotypic features of clinical strains (Buesa et al. 2002; Bull et al. 2007; Hoa Tran et al. 2013). Recombination is a potentially important means by which these viruses generate diversity (Bull et al. 2007; Eden et al. 2013). Dual genotyping based on the polymerase encoding region and the capsid amino acid sequence can be conducted by using a web-based tool: http://www.rivm.nl/mpf/norovirus/typingtool (Kroneman et al. 2011). The method employs percent pairwise similarities in reference to prototype strains. Thus, the polymerase genotype is defined with a cut-off value of \u226515 % for the polymerase nucleotide sequence (about 800 nt at the 3\u2032 end of ORF1), whereas the capsid genotype is defined with a cut-off value of \u226515 % for the major capsid protein (VP1) amino acid sequence (Vinj\u00e9 et al. 2004; Zheng et al. 2006). Thus far, 14 GI and 29 GII polymerase genotypes and 9 GI and 22 GII capsid genotypes have been described (RIVM-NoroNet) (Kroneman et al. 2013). Genotype GII.4 is further divided into variants (sub-genotypes) based on sequence diversity (Vinj\u00e9 et al. 2004; Siebenga et al. 2007; Buesa et al. 2008; Kroneman et al. 2011). New GII.4 variants are recognized only after evidence is provided that they have become epidemic lineages in at least two geographically diverse locations. Table 3.2 shows the new consensus nomenclature for epidemic norovirus GII.4 variants (Kroneman et al. 2013).\n",

In the major capsid protein VP1, human norovirus strains within the same genogroup share at least 60 % amino acid sequence identity, whereas most GI strains share less than 50 % amino acid identity with GII strains (Green et al. 2001; Koopmans et al. 2003).

If RNA recombination is a common phenomenon among caliciviruses, high diversity of the family might be expected, which would facilitate the emergence of new variants and make genotyping more difficult (Bull et al. 2012). Recombination may permit caliciviruses to escape host immunity, analogous to antigenic shifts by influenza viruses, but by a different molecular mechanism. It has also been reported that accumulation of mutations in the protruding P2 domain of the capsid protein may result in predicted structural changes, including disappearance of a helix structure of the protein, and thus a possible emergence of new phenotypes (Nilsson et al. 2003; Lindesmith et al. 2011).",

All published sapovirus strains except a human strain, London/92, and a porcine strain, PEC Cowden, contain an additional ORF predicted in +1 frame, overlapping the N terminus of the capsid encoding region (Guo et al. 1999b; Jiang et al. 1999; Clarke and Lambden 2001). By analogy with the classification of the noroviruses, the sapoviruses were previously divided into four genotypes, belonging to two genogroups (Liu et al. 1995; Noel et al. 1997; Clarke and Lambden 2000). More recently, human sapoviruses have been classified into five genogroups (Schuffenecker et al. 2001; Farkas et al. 2004) (Table 3.3). In addition, the porcine enteric calicivirus (Cowden strain) has been shown to be related to the Sapovirus genus but belongs to a differentiated cluster (Guo et al. 1999b). Further classification of sapovirus into genotypes has also been undertaken, though taxonomic assignment at the genotype level appears to be less well-defined than at the genogroup level (L\u2019Homme et al. 2010; Oka et al. 2012). Members of SaV GI, GII, GIV, and GV are found to infect humans and those of GIII are found in swine (Farkas et al. 2004). Each genogroup can be further subdivided into a number of genotypes or genetic clusters. Recent studies underscore the ambiguity in classification of animal SaVs beyond the species level and serves as a caution against proposing novel Sapovirus genogroups based only on short polymerase sequences (L\u2019Homme et al. 2009a).\n",

Analysis of individual recombinant proteins from these noncultivable caliciviruses allowed the identification of NTPase and 3C-like cysteine protease activities for RHDV and noroviruses (Liu et al. 1999) and a 3D-like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for RHDV (L\u00f3pez-Vazquez et al. 1998). Studies on the replication mechanisms of cultivatable caliciviruses, like feline calicivirus (FCV), have contributed to a better understanding of the basic features of calicivirus replication (Sosnovtsev and Green 2003). The FCV replicates by producing two major types of polyadenylated RNAs; a positive-sense genomic RNA of approximately 7.7 kb, and a subgenomic RNA of 2.4 kb (Herbert et al. 1996b). The genomic RNA serves as a template for synthesis of the nonstructural protein encoded by the ORF1, whereas the subgenomic RNA is a template for translation of structural proteins (Carter 1990).",

Prior treatment of RNA with proteinase K completely abolished RNA infectivity, suggesting a key role of a RNA-protein complex. However, a block to viral spread to other cells in the culture remained, indicating that the blockade exists at the stage of cell entry and/or uncoating (Guix et al. 2007). A number of host factors are important in norovirus life cycle as demonstrated by proteomics and reverse genetics (Bailey et al. 2010; Yunus et al. 2010). It has been shown that the norovirus VPg protein interacts with the host cell cap-binding proteins eIF4E and eIF4G (Chaudhry et al. 2007). The crystallographic structures of the VPg proteins from FCV and MNV have been recently determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Leen et al. 2013).",

For uncultivatable caliciviruses, such as human norovirus, replicon systems with either transient or stable expression of viral RNA have been developed. Transfection of a full-length cDNA clone of the Norwalk virusRNA under the control of T7 promoter into MVA-T7 infected cells allowed the expression of viral proteins and Norwalk virus RNA replication (Asanaka et al. 2005). A cell-based replicon was generated for Norwalk virus replication using a cloned cDNA consensus sequence of the Norwalk virus genome (Fernandez-Vega et al. 2004) engineered to encode the neomycin resistance gene as a selective marker within ORF2. However, only few transfected cells could apparently support virus replication, suggesting that severe growth restrictions were present in the cells (Chang et al. 2006; Chang et al. 2008).",

Experiments with recombinant Norwalk VLPs and human gastrointestinal biopsies showed that VLPs bind to epithelial cells of the pyloric region of the stomach and to enterocytes on duodenal villi. Attachment of the rVLPs occurred only on cells as well as to saliva from histo-blood group antigen (HBGA)-secreting individuals (Marionneau et al. 2002). It was previously determined that RHDV attaches to H type 2 HBGAs present on rabbit epithelial cells (Ruv\u00f6en-Clouet et al. 2000). Significant attachment of Norwalk rVLPs onto differentiated Caco-2 cells has been demonstrated (White et al. 1996). Differentiated Caco-2 cells, derived from an individual expressing the group O blood type, resemble mature enterocytes and express H-type HBGAs on their cell surfaces (Amano and Oshima 1999).",

            "text": "Although noroviruses are highly infectious (it has been estimated that as low as 18 and as high as 2800 virions are enough to infect an adult (Atmar et al. 2014; Teunis et al. 2008) studies in volunteers have shown that some subjects remain uninfected despite having been challenged with a high dose of virus (Matsui and Greenberg 2000). This could be due to the presence of innate resistance or pre-existing immunity to the virus (Lindesmith et al. 2003). An increased risk of Norwalk virus infection has been associated with blood group O; and Norwalk VLPs bind to gastroduodenal cells from individuals who are secretors (Se+) but not to those from non-secretors (Se-) (Hutson et al. 2002; Marionneau et al. 2002). The gene responsible for the secretor phenotype FUT2 encodes an \u03b1(1,2) fucosyltransferase that produces H type HBGAs found on the surface of gastrointestinal epithelial cells and in mucosal secretions (Lindesmith et al. 2003). Additional forms of HBGAs found on the gut mucosa and its secretions depend on additional glycosyltransferases, including those that produce the Lewis antigens and the A- and B-type antigens related to those present on red blood cells (Marionneau et al. 2001). The discovery that noroviruses attach to cells in the gut only if the individual expresses specific, genetically-determined HBGA carbohydrates is a breakthrough in understanding norovirus-host interactions and susceptibility to norovirus infections (Lindesmith et al. 2003; Hutson et al. 2004). Individuals with defects in the FUT2 gene are termed secretor-negative, do not express the appropriate HBGAs necessary for Norwalk virus binding, and are therefore resistant to Norwalk virus infection. These data argue that FUT2 and other genes encoding enzymes that regulate the processing of the HBGA carbohydrates function as susceptibility alleles. However, secretor-negative individuals can be infected with other norovirus strains (Le Pendu et al. 2006; Lindesmith et al. 2008).",

            "text": "To explore the process of norovirus attachment to cells, virus-like particles (VLPs), which mimic native virions morphologically and antigenically, have been used (White et al. 1996; Lindesmith et al. 2003; Allen et al. 2008). The C-terminal of the P-domain of NoVs has the ability to auto-assemble into subviral particles, termed P particles (Tan and Jiang 2005), which are potentially useful for broad applications including vaccine development (Tan et al. 2011). The C-terminal region (P domain) of the capsid protein is involved in HBGA attachment and, therefore, plays an essential role in cell infection (Marionneau et al. 2002; Hutson et al. 2003). The crystal structures of the HBGA-binding interfaces of Norwalk virus (GI.1) and VA387 (GII.4) have been elucidated, each representing one of the two major genogroups of human noroviruses (Cao et al. 2007; Choi et al. 2008). The HBGA-binding interfaces of the two strains differ significantly in their structures, precise locations of HBGA-binding locations and amino acid compositions, although both locate on the top of the arch-like P dimer of the viral capsids (Tan et al. 2009). Sequence alignment has shown that the key residues responsible for HBGA binding are highly conserved within but not between genogroups GI and GII and the remaining sequences of the P2 subdomain are highly variable (Tan et al. 2009; Tan and Jiang 2010). It has been suggested that noroviruses may use secondary or alternative receptors other than HBGAs when attaching to enterocytes. Hence HBGAs could play a role as co-receptors but blocking such interactions may not abolish attachment to these cells (Murakami et al. 2013).",

            "text": "The classical classification system for rotaviruses was derived from their genome composition and the immunological reactivity of three of their structural proteins VP6, VP7 and VP4. Rotaviruses are classified into at least eight groups (A to H) according to the immunological reactivity of the VP6 middle layer protein. Group A rotaviruses are commonly associated with infections in humans. Within group A, two major subgroups (I and II) exist (Iturriza Gomara et al. 2002). The two outer capsid proteins, VP7 and VP4, elicit neutralizing antibodies and are considered to be involved in protection against infection. Using these two proteins a traditional dual classification system of group A rotaviruses into G (depending on VP7 that is a Glycoprotein) and P (from the VP4 that is sensitive to Proteases) types was established (Estes and Kapikian 2007). At least 27 different G-serotypes and 37 P-types have been identified among human and animal rotaviruses, depending on VP7 and VP4, respectively. G serotypes correlate fully with G genotypes as determined by sequence analysis of their VP7 gene. However, many P genotypes do not correlate with P serotypes (Estes and Kapikian 2007). Because VP4 and VP7 are coded by different RNA segments (segment 4 and segments 7\u20139, respectively), various combinations of G- and P-types can be found in both humans and animals. Viruses carrying G1P[8], G2[P4], G3[P8] and G4[P8] represent over 90 % of human rotavirus strains co-circulating in most countries, although other G and P combinations are also being isolated in increasing numbers (Iturriza-Gomara et al. 2011). Besides this dual classification system, another system has been utilized including the genotype of the rotavirus enterotoxin, the NSP4 gene (Rodriguez-Diaz et al. 2008; Banyai et al. 2009).",

This classification system allows a better understanding of genomic and antigenic diversity of rotaviruses as well as the reassortment events present in the rotavirus strains. In this genomic classification, each of the 11 RNA segments has been given a tag that includes the traditional G for VP7, P for VP4 protein and E for the NSP4 protein (NSP4 is the viral enterotoxin). The completegenome classification code is as follows: Gx-P[x]-Ix-Rx-Cx-Mx-Ax-Nx-Tx-Ex-Hx correlating with the VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5/6 encoding genes, respectively (Matthijnssens et al. 2008b; Matthijnssens et al. 2011). Whole genome analysis of rotavirus strains is generating interest in their complete genetic constellations and complex genetic diversity (Matthijnssens and Van Ranst 2012). On the basis of complete group A rotavirus genome sequence comparisons, two major genotype constellations of the non-G, non-P genes; I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1 (Wa-like) and I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2 (DS-1-like), have been shown to circulate worldwide among humans. Human Wa-like rotavirus A (RVA) strains are believed to have a common ancestor with porcine RVA strains, whereas human DS-1-like strains are believed to have several gene segments which have a common ancestor with bovine RVA strains (Matthijnssens et al. 2008a). A third (minor) human genotype constellation, referred to as AU-1-like (I3-R3-C3-M3-A3-N3-T3-E3-H3), is believed to originate from cats or dogs (Nakagomi et al. 1990).",

Rotavirus particles are of icosahedral symmetry, consist of three concentric layers of protein and measure ~1000 \u00c5 in diameter including the spikes (Estes and Kapikian 2007). The core layer is formed by the VP2 protein entirely surrounding the 11 segments of double-stranded genomic RNA, and proteins VP1 and VP3, which are transcription enzymes attached as a heterodimeric complex to the inside surface of VP2 at the fivefold axis of symmetry (Prasad et al. 1996b) (Fig. 3.3). VP1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, interacts with VP3, the guanyltransferase and methylase protein (Liu et al. 1992). This inner core structure is composed of 120 copies of VP2, which is a RNA-binding protein (Labbe et al. 1991). The addition of VP6 to the VP2 layer produces double-layered particles (DLP). VP6 forms 260 trimers interrupted by 132 aqueous channels of three different kinds in relation to the capsid\u2019s symmetry. The outer capsid of the triple-layered particles (TLP) is composed of two proteins, VP7 and VP4. The smooth surface of the virus is made up of 260 trimers of VP7 and 60 spikes emerging from the viral surface consist of dimers of VP4 (Prasad et al. 1988; Yeager et al. 1990). Rotavirus DLP and TLP contain 132 porous channels which allow the exchange of compounds to the inside of the virus particle. There are 12 type I channels each of which is located at the icosahedral fivefold vertices of the TLP and DLP. Each of the type I channels is surrounded by five type II channels, and 60 type III channels are placed at the hexavalent positions immediately neighboring the icosahedral threefold axis (Prasad et al. 1988; Yeager et al. 1990).\n",

VP4 is a non-glycosylated protein of 776 amino acids and has essential functions in the virus cell cycle, including receptor binding, cell penetration, hemagglutinin activity, and permeability of cellular membranes (Estes and Kapikian 2007). VP4 is post-transcriptionally cleaved into the larger VP5* and the smaller VP8* subunits; the cleavage of VP4 enhances virus infectivity by several fold. It has been shown that trypsin cleavage confers icosahedrical ordering on the VP4 spikes, which is essential for the virus to enter the cell (Crawford et al. 2001). Moreover, biochemical studies on recombinant VP4 showed that proteolysis of monomeric VP4 yields dimeric VP5* (Dormitzer et al. 2001). VP7 is a calcium-binding glycoprotein of 326 amino acids with nine variable regions contributing to type-specificity (Nishikawa et al. 1989; Hoshino et al. 1994). In addition, VP7 interacts with integrins \u03b1x\u03b22 and \u03b14\u03b21 (Coulson et al. 1997a; Hewish et al. 2000) and induces polyclonal intestinal B-cell activation during rotavirus infection (Blutt et al. 2004).",

Cryo-EM studies have confirmed that DLPs maintain their structural integrity during the process of transcription. In a pseudo-atomic model of the T = 13 VP6 layer (Mathieu et al. 2001), a \u03b2-hairpin motif of VP6 with a highly conserved sequence that protrudes into the mRNA exit channel may play a functional role in the translocation of the nascent transcripts (Lawton et al. 2000).

            "text": "Cryo-EM analysis of rotavirus provided visualization of the structural organization of the viral genome (Prasad et al. 1996b). It was shown that the dsRNA forms a dodecahedral structure in which the RNA double helices, interacting closely with the VP2 inner layer, are packed around the transcription complexes located at the icosahedral vertices (Fig. 3.3d). VP2 has RNA binding properties and may be responsible for the icosahedral ordering and the closely interacting portions of the RNA. Pesavento et al. (2001) have demonstrated reversible condensation and expansion of the rotavirus genome within the capsid interior under various chemical conditions. This condensation is concentric with respect to the particle center and a dark mass of density is consistently seen in the center of each of the particles (Pesavento et al. 2001). At high pH in the presence of ammonium ions, the genome condenses to a radius of 180 \u00c5 from the original radius of 220 \u00c5, and when brought back to physiological pH the genome expands to its original radius (Pesavento et al. 2001). These studies suggest that VP2, through itsRNA-binding properties, plays an important role in maintaining the appropriate spacing between the RNA strands in the native expanded state. A plausible and elegant model for the structural organization of the genome that emerges from these studies is that each dsRNA segment is spooled around a transcription enzyme complex at the fivefold axes, inside the innermost capsid layer (Prasad et al. 1996b; Pesavento et al. 2001; Pesavento et al. 2003).",

            "text": "Rotaviruses, like many RNA viruses, display a great degree of diversity. In addition to different G and P types and a variety of combinations of these, there also exists intratypic variation. Three mechanisms, singularly or in combination, are important for the evolution and diversity of rotaviruses, although it is not clear what their relative contributions are to the burden of disease:\nAntigenic drift: The rate of mutation within rotavirus genes is relatively high because RNA replication is error-prone. The mutation rate has been calculated to be <5 \u00d7 10\u22125 per nucleotide per replication which implies that on average, a rotavirus genome differs from its parental genome by at least one mutation (Blackhall et al. 1996). Point mutations can accumulate and give rise to intratypic variation as identified by the existence of lineages within the VP7 and VP4 genes of particular G and P types. Point mutations can lead to antigenic changes, which may result in the emergence of escape mutants (Palombo et al. 1993; Cunliffe et al. 1997; Maunula and von Bonsdorff 1998; Iturriza Gomara et al. 2002; Estes and Kapikian 2007).\nAntigenic shift: Shuffling of gene segments throughreassortment can occur during dual infection of one cell. Reassortment can, therefore, contribute to the diversity of rotaviruses and there is increasing evidence that reassortment takes place in vivo (Ramig 2000). There is also evidence that reassortment, through alterations in protein-protein interactions possibly leading to changes in conformational epitopes, can contribute to the evolution of antigenic types (Chen et al. 1992; Lazdins et al. 1995). Interspecies transmission and the subsequent reassortment have the potential to enormously increase the diversity of co-circulating rotaviruses. In addition, human rotavirus genes encoding proteins to which the human population is immunologically na\u00efve may allow a rapid spread of the reassortant strain (Iturriza-Gomara et al. 2000). While antigenic drift has always been considered one of the main forces driving rotavirus evolution, extensive analysis of whole genome sequences seems to reveal there are restrictions to this evolution mechanism (Matthijnssens and Van Ranst 2012).\nGene rearrangements: The concatemerization or truncation of genome segments and their ORFs has the potential to contribute to the evolution of rotaviruses through the production of new proteins with altered functions (Desselberger 1996).\n",

            "text": "The RNA polymerase activity of DLPs catalyzes the synthesis of the 11 mRNAs of rotaviruses, which range in size from ~0.7 to 3.3 kb. With the exception of gene 11, they are monocistronic (Estes and Kapikian 2007). The nascent transcripts are extruded through channels present at the fivefold-axes of the DLPs (Lawton et al. 1997). The 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs) are 9\u201349 and 17\u2013182 nucleotides in length, respectively. The viral mRNAs serve as templates for the synthesis of minus-strand RNA, to form dsRNA molecules (Chen et al. 1994). The synthesis of dsRNA and the assembly of cores and DLPs occur in viroplasms in the cytoplasm (Estes and Kapikian 2007). There are three species of RNA-containing replication intermediates (RIs) in the infected cells: pre-core RIs, which contain the structural proteins VP1 and VP3; core-RIs with VP1, VP2 and VP3; and double layered RIs, which contain VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP6. The 11 genomic segments are produced and packaged in equimolar amounts in rotavirus-infected cells, which demonstrates that RNA packaging and replication are coordinated processes (Patton and Gallegos 1990). The absence of naked dsRNA in infected cells suggests that packaging takes place before replication (Patton et al. 2003).",

Since all 11 mRNAs are replicated by the same VP1-VP2-VP3 polymerase complex, the viral mRNAs almost certainly share common cis-acting signals recognized by the polymerase (Patton et al. 2003). The most remarkable feature of the 3\u2032 end of rotavirus mRNA, as well as that of other members of the Reoviridae family, is the absence of a poly(A) tail. Instead, all rotavirus genes and mRNAs end with the same short sequence, UGACC, which is conserved amongst all the segments in group A rotaviruses. Site-specific mutagenesis has revealed that it is the 3\u2032-CC of the 3\u2032 consensus sequence that is most critical for minus-strand synthesis (Chen et al. 2001). In addition, it has been demonstrated that the promoter for minus-strand synthesis is formed by base-pairing in cis of complementary sequences proximal to the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-ends of the viral mRNAs (Chen and Patton 1998). The 3\u2032-consensus sequence also contains a cis-acting signal that acts as a translation enhancer, whose activity is mediated by NSP3 that specifically recognizes the last four to five nucleotides of the 3\u2032-consensus sequence (Poncet et al. 1994). NSP3 also interacts with the initiation factor, eIF4GI, and facilitates the circularization of viral mRNAs in polysomes, hence increasing the efficiency of viral gene expression (Piron et al. 1998).",

Recently, two systems that allow partial reverse genetics on rotavirus have emerged. The first approach utilized a helper virus and neutralizing selection antibodies (Komoto et al. 2006; Komoto et al. 2008). However, in this approach only structural proteins that are able to elicit specific neutralizing antibodies could be modified. In the second approach, the combination of athermosensitive defect in the NSP2 protein with RNAi-mediated degradation of NSP2 mRNAs allowed the dual selection and recovery of recombinant viruses with modifications in a non-structural protein coding gene (Trask et al. 2010; Navarro et al. 2013).",

Some animal rotavirus strains interact with sialic acid (SA) residues to attach to the cell surface and hence their infectivity is diminished by the treatment of cells with neuraminidase (NA). In contrast, many animal and human strains are NA-resistant (Ciarlet and Estes 1999). The interaction of rotavirus with SA has been shown to depend on the VP4 genotype of the virus and not the species of origin (Ciarlet et al. 2002b). Ganglioside GM3 has been suggested to act as the SA-containing receptor for the porcine rotavirus strain OSU (Rahman et al. 2003) and ganglioside GM1 (NA-resistant) has been identified as the receptor for the NA-resistant human rotavirus strains KUN and MO (Guo et al. 1999a).",

The interaction of rotavirus with integrin \u03b12\u03b21 has been shown to be mediated by the DGE integrin-recognition motif, located at amino acids 308\u2013310 of VP4 within VP5* (Z\u00e1rate et al. 2000). VP4 also contains the tripeptide, IDA, at amino acids 538\u2013540, which is a ligand-binding motif for integrin \u03b14\u03b21 (Coulson et al. 1997); however, the functionality of this site has not been demonstrated. Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 has also been shown to be involved in the cell entry of several rotavirus strains at a post-attachment step (Graham et al. 2003). Besides, cell-surface heat shock cognate protein, hsc70, has also been implicated as a post-attachment receptor for both NA-sensitive and NA-resistant rotavirus strains (Guerrero et al. 2002). Studies with polarized epithelial cell lines show that the viral entry of SA-dependent strains is restricted to the apical membrane, whereas SA-independent strains enter either apically or basolaterally (Ciarlet et al. 2001). It has been suggested that lipid rafts might play a role in the cell entry of rotavirus (Isa et al. 2004), probably serving as platforms to allow an efficient interaction of cell receptors with the viral particle (Manes et al. 2003; Lopez and Arias 2004).",

It has been demonstrated that NSP4 binds intracellular DLPs, interacting with VP6 (Estes and Kapikian 2007). Many structural motifs or protein regions have been implicated in the NSP4 biological function. Amino acids 17\u201320 from the C-terminus are necessary and sufficient for inner capsid particle binding (O\u2019Brien et al. 2000) and the region involved in the retention of the NSP4 protein into the endoplasmic reticulum has been mapped to be between amino acids 85 and 123 at the cytoplasmic region of the protein (Mirazimi et al. 2003). Residues at positions 48\u201391, a region which includes a potential cationic amphipathic helix, are involved in membrane destabilization (Tian et al. 1996; Browne et al. 2000). Purified NSP4 or a peptide corresponding to NSP4 residues 114\u2013135 induce diarrhea in young mice after an increase in intracellular calcium levels, suggesting a role for NSP4 in rotavirus pathogenesis (Tian et al. 1994; Ball et al. 1996; Horie et al. 1999; Rodriguez-Diaz et al. 2003). In vitro studies have shown that following rotavirus replication in cells, a functional 7-KDa peptide of NSP4 (amino acids 112\u2013175) is released from virus-infected cells into the medium by a non-classic, Golgi-independent cellular secretory pathway (Zhang et al. 2000). This endogenously produced peptide binds to apical membrane receptors to mobilize intracellular calcium through phospholipase C signaling. Seo et al. (2008) reported that recombinant NSP4 can bind to the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) present on integrins \u03b11\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b21 and activates intracellular signalling pathways that regulate spreading between cells. Rotavirus and NSP4 alone induce age-dependent diarrhea and chloride permeability changes in mice lacking the cystic fibrosis transductance regulator (CFTR) (Morris et al. 1999). These results indicate that NSP4 is a novel secretory agonist, because the classical secretagogues carbachol and the diterpene forskolin that induce chloride changes by activating cyclic adenosine monophosphate, instead of by mobilizing [Ca2+]i as a secondary mediator, fail to cause disease in CFTR knockout mice (Morris et al. 1999).",

More recently it has been reported that NSP4 triggers the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophage-like THP-1 cells and nitric oxide from murine RAW 264.7 cells (Ge et al. 2013). Therefore, NSP4 acts as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) encoded by rotavirus and provides a mechanism for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with clinical symptoms of infection in humans and animals.",

More detailed ultrastructural analysis of human astrovirus serotype 2 grown in LLCMK2 cells in the presence of trypsin revealed particles with icosahedral symmetry and an array of spikes emanating from the surface (Risco et al. 1995). These particles had an external diameter on negatively stained preparations of 41 nm (including spikes). They did not display the star-like surface appearance characteristically found on fecally shed virus. The star-like morphology was inducible after alkaline treatment (pH 10), and further alkalinization (pH 10.5) led to particle disruption. Intact virions generally band at densities of 1.35\u20131.37 g/ml in CsCl (Caul and Appleton 1982), although banding at densities of 1.39\u20131.40 have also been reported (Konno et al. 1982; Midthun et al. 1993).

The organization of the genome includes three long ORFs, designated as ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2. The length of the three ORFs varies among different viral strains and the largest variation in ORF1a is due to common insertions and deletions (in/del regions) in its 3\u2032 end (Willcocks et al. 1994; Guix et al. 2005). ORF1a (~2700 nt) is located at the 5\u2032 end of the genome and contains transmembrane helices, a 3C-like serine protease motif, a putative protease-dependent cleavage site, and a nuclear localization signal (Jiang et al. 1993a; Willcocks et al. 1994).

The subgenomic RNA (approximately 2400 nucleotides) is translated as a 87 kDa capsid precursor protein that is believed to give rise to three to five smaller, mature capsid proteins in a process that involves trypsin and a putative cellular protease (Monroe et al. 1991; Bass and Qiu 2000; Mendez et al. 2002). The 87 kDa capsid protein is rapidly converted intracellularly to a 79 kDa form, which is found in smaller amounts in the cell supernatants. Bass and Qiu (2000) identified a trypsin cleavage site in a highly conserved region of the ORF2 product (Bass and Qiu 2000). Trypsin-free particles were minimally infectious in Caco-2 cells but became highly infectious after trypsin, but not chymotrypsin, treatment. This trypsin-enhanced infectivity correlated with conversion of the 79-kDa capsid protein into three smaller peptides of approximately 26, 29 and 34 kDa. However, the apparent molecular weight reported for the smaller mature proteins depends on the astrovirus serotype and whether the virus studied was derived from infected cultured cells or from stools (Matsui et al. 2001).",

Protein composition of these purified VLPs revealed no substantial difference from that of authentic astrovirus virions when analysed by Western blotting. Trypsin cleavage seemed to be necessary to process the capsid polyprotein into the mature structural proteins. The three virological features which altogether distinguish astroviruses from other positive ssRNA viruses are: thelocation of the ORF1a and ORF1b encoding regions for non-structural proteins at the 5\u2032 end of the genome and the presence of the ORF2 structural protein encoding region at the 3\u2032 end; the use of a RFS mechanism to translate the RdRp encoded in ORF1b; and the lack of a helicase domain, characteristic of the positive ssRNA viruses with genomes larger than 6 kb. The presence of a VPg protein linked to the 5\u2032-end of the astrovirus genome has also been speculated for many years but its existence has only recently been confirmed for human astroviruses (Fuentes et al. 2012).",

Enteroviruses, named after the site of replication, rarely cause gastroenteritis. In many cases the enterovirus isolated might merely have been a passenger virus unrelated to the disease (Melnick 2001). The capsids of enteroviruses (family Picornaviridae) are composed of four structural proteins (VP1-VP4) arranged in 60 repeating protomeric units with icosahedral symmetry. Among the family members, the capsid proteins are arranged similarly, but the surface architecture varies. These differences account for not only the different serotypes but also the different modes of interaction with cell receptors. The basic building block of the picornavirus capsid is the protomer, which contains one copy of each structural protein. The capsid is formed by VP1 to VP3, and VP4 lies on its inner surface. VP1, VP2, and VP3 have no sequence homology, yet all three proteins have the same topology: they form an eight-stranded antiparallel \u201c\u03b2-barrel\u201d core structure (Racaniello 2007). The external loops that connect the beta strands are responsible for differences in the antigenic diversity among the enteroviruses. Neutralization sites are more densely clustered on VP1.",

In contrast, cardioviruses and aphthoviruses do not have canyons (Racaniello 2007). Immediately beneath the canyon floor of each protomer is a hydrophobic pocket occupied by a lipid moiety. These molecules, termed pocket factors, have been shown to stabilize the capsid and their removal from the pocket is a necessary prerequisite to uncoating. The pocket factors have been proposed, from the electron densities and uncoating studies, to be short chain fatty acids (Smyth et al. 2003).",

The P2 and P3 regions encode the nonstructural proteins, essential for viral replication (2A-C and 3A-D). Translation of the ORF gives rise to a single large polyprotein that is post-translationally modified by virus-encoded proteases.

It was proposed by the ICTV that this virus be assigned to a new genus named Kobuvirus (King et al. 1999). \u201cKobu\u201d means knob in Japanese, which was suggested due to the characteristic morphology of the virion.

It contains a large ORF with 7299 nucleotides that encodes a polyprotein precursor of 2432 amino acids. The ORF is preceded by 744 nucleotides and followed by 237 nucleotides and a poly(A) tail. The precise secondary structure of the 5\u2032 non-translated region (5\u2032-NTR) has not been defined although an IRES similar to that of other members of the Picornaviridae family has been reported (Sasaki et al. 2001). The complete nucleotide sequence of Aichivirus (GenBank accession no. AB010145) has been determined (Yamashita et al. 1998).",

It has been demonstrated that the IRES is located between nucleotides 151 and 734, which is able to direct internal initiation of translation in a cap-independent manner (Brown et al. 1994). However, a cap-dependent message effectively competes with the IRES of HAV (Glass et al. 1993). Translational efficiency of this IRES may be dependent on the availability of intact cellular proteins such as the p220 subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-4 F, and requires the association between the cap-binding translation initiation factor (eIF4E) and eIF4G (Ali et al. 2001; Borman et al. 2001). The 5\u2032-NTR is the most highly conserved region in the HAV genome among all strains sequenced to date, with a 95 % nucleotide identity. By contrast, the 3\u2032-NTR region shows the highest (up to 20 %) degree of variability. The presence of a short cis-acting element has been described; it is 23 nucleotides long and specifically interacts with proteins involved in the establishment and maintenance of the persistent type of infection characteristic of most HAV isolates. Several unidentified cytoplasmic and ribosomal proteins in infected cells bind to the 3\u2032 end of HAV RNA, indicating an intimate and dynamic interaction between host proteins and viral RNA (Kusov et al. 1996). The poly(A) tail is also involved in the formation of RNA/protein complexes.",

The 2C gene carries a guanidine resistance marker and is assumed to play a role in viral RNA replication (Cohen et al. 1987b). The 3D region is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which shows the highest degree of homology (29 %) with the corresponding sequence in the poliovirus type 1 protein (Cohen et al. 1987b). A region of 18 amino acids considered to be essential for an active polymerase is present in the 3D region. This sequence contains a conserved motif of two aspartate residues flanked by hydrophobic amino acids that might function as a GTP-binding domain (Kamer and Argos 1984).

A consequence of this special codon bias is an increase in the number of rare codons used. The critical role of HAV codon usage, and particularly of these clusters of rare codons of the capsid-coding region, has been shown in functional genomic studies during the process of adaptation of HAV to conditions of artificially induced cellular shut-off (replication in the presence of actinomycin D) (Aragones et al. 2010). It has also been suggested that this codon usage contributes to the low antigenic variability observed within the HAV capsid (Aragones et al. 2008). A total of 15 % of the surface capsid residues are encoded by rare codons. These rare codons are highly conserved among the different HAV strains (Sanchez et al. 2003) and their substitution is negatively selected even under specific immune pressure (Aragones et al. 2008).",

            "text": "The genomes of all picornaviruses encode a single polyprotein which is co- and post-translationally cleaved by virus-encoded proteinase(s). In contrast to\nwell-characterized proteolytic events in the polyproteins of viruses within the genera Enterovirus and Rhinovirus, this processing has been difficult to characterize in the genus Hepatovirus. It has been shown that the primary cleavage of the HAV polyprotein occurs at the 2A/2B junction, which has been mapped by the N-terminal sequencing of 2B. This primary cleavage is mediated by the 3Cpro proteinase, the only proteinase known to be encoded by the virus (Martin et al. 1995; Gosert et al. 1996). The P1-2A capsid protein precursor is probably released from the nonstructural protein precursor (P3-2BC) as soon as 3Cpro is synthesized, as the full-length polyprotein has not been observed in these studies. A P1-2A precursor produced in a cell-free translation system has been shown to be cleaved in vitro by recombinant 3Cpro to generate VP0 (VP4-VP2), VP3 and VP1-2A (Malcolm et al. 1992). This VP1-2A polypeptide is unique to the hepatoviruses; it associates with VP0 and VP3 to form pentamers, intermediates in the morphogenesis of HAV particles (Borovec and Andersen 1993). The mature capsid protein VP1 is subsequently derived from the VP1-2A precursor later in the morphogenesis process. It has been hypothesized that the maturation of VP1 is dependent on 3Cpro processing of the VP1-2A precursor (Probst et al. 1998). However, it has also been shown, using recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing relevant HAV substrates, that 3Cpro is incapable of directing the cleavage of VP1 from the VP1-2A precursor. Therefore, maturation of VP1 could not depend on processing by 3Cpro proteinase (Martin et al. 1999).",

            "text": "The main target cells for HAV replication are hepatocytes, although HAV antigen has also been detected in crypt cells of the intestine and Kupffer cells of the liver (Asher et al. 1995). Two cellular receptors for HAV have been proposed: the HAV cell receptor 1 (HAVCR1), which belongs to the T-cell immunoglobulin mucin family (Kaplan et al. 1996) and the asialoglycoprotein receptor, which binds and internalizes IgA-coated HAV complexes (Dotzauer et al. 2000). The general scheme of the replicative cycle of HAV is very similar to that of other picornaviruses (Racaniello 2007). After interaction with the receptor(s), the uncoating of the positive-sense RNA viral genome takes place. This process is extremely slow in HAV (at least in vitro with cell-adapted strains) taking several hours compared with the 30-min period common to most picornaviruses (Bishop and Anderson 2000). The HAV typically has a protracted and non-cytolytic replication cycle in cell culture and fails to shut down host cell metabolism (Lemon and Robertson 1993). Even after successful adaptation to growth in cell cultures, replication of HAV is a slow process that terminates in a state of persistent infection (de Chastonay and Siegl 1987). Cytopathic HAV strains have been recovered only from persistently infected cell cultures. Maximal levels of viral RNA synthesis can be detected at 24 h after infection and exponential production of progeny virus continues up to day 4 post-infection. Lysis of infected cells may become apparent within 3\u20139 days post-infection and yield of progeny virus rarely exceeds 107 TCID50/ml (Siegl et al. 1984). Cap-independent translation of the viral genome takes place through the IRES within the 5\u2032 noncoding region. The polyprotein is co- and post-translationally processed by the viral protease and the newly synthesized RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, as well as several membrane-interacting proteins,\nassemble at the 3\u2032 end of the genomic RNA to start the synthesis of a negative-strand copy of the viral genome. Finally, after the structural proteins are assembled into capsid particles and the positive-strand RNA molecules are packaged, the newly synthesized virions are secreted across the apical membrane of the hepatocyte (Pinto et al. 2012).",

These structures and a sequence closer to the 3\u2032 end of ORF1, which has homology to the alphavirus junction region, are proposed to be important for RNA replication (Purdy et al. 1993).

Three RNA species of around 7.2, 3.7, and 2 kb, designated as the genomic and two subgenomic RNAs, respectively, were detected in the liver tissue of macaques experimentally infected with HEV (Tam et al. 1991). In this model, the 7.2 kb RNA was proposed to be translated into the ORF1 protein and the 3.7 and 2 kb subgenomic RNAs into ORF3 and ORF2 proteins, respectively (Ahmad et al. 2011). However, in stable Huh-7 cell lines made from functional HEV RNA replicons expressing the neomycin resistance gene from ORF2 and ORF3, only the genomic RNA and one subgenomic RNA were observed (Graff et al. 2006). This model was confirmed by intrahepatic inoculation of wild type and mutant genotype 3 swine HEV replicons into pigs (Huang et al. 2007). Mutation of AUG1 or the insertion of a T base, as in genotype 4, did not affect virus infectivity or rescue, but the mutation of AUG3 abolished virus infectivity.",

The viral negative-strand RNA is proposed to be a template for the synthesis of the positive-strand genomic and subgenomic RNAs, the latter from within the junction region in a primer-independent manner (Ahmad et al. 2011). The junction region of the negative-strand RNA is predicted to fold into a stable stem-loop structure and to play important roles in HEV replication (Cao et al. 2010).",

Besides these regions, two other regions designated X (and also called the macro domain) and Y, share significant homology with nonstructural proteins of other positive-strand RNA viruses. A polyproline region (PRP) or hypervariable region upstream of the macro domain may act as a flexible hinge. It is not entirely clear whether the ORF1 polyprotein is processed into biochemically distinct units, as is the case with other positive-strand RNA viruses.

It has also been suggested that the viral macro domains could have a role in the viral RNA replication and/or transcription.

A genotype 3 ORF2 protein expressed using recombinant vaccinia virus was also glycosylated and localized to the ER, Golgi, and surface of infected cells (Jimenez de Oya et al. 2012). A truncated protein of 56 kDa (amino acids 112\u2013607) can self-assemble in insect cells to form virus-like particles of 23\u201324 nm in diameter (Li et al. 1997). The ORF2 protein localizes to the ER, and some of the protein is retrotranslocated to the cytoplasm through an ER-associated degradation pathway (Surjit et al. 2007). It has also been demonstrated that ORF2 activates the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a), an increased expression of the ATF-4 transcription factor, and activation of the pro-apoptotic gene CHOP (John et al. 2011). An infectious cDNA clone of HEV has been constructed that propagates efficiently in cultured PLC/PRF/5 cells (Yamada et al. 2009). Using this model the intracellular expression and secretion of an 83 kDa ORF2 protein was shown. Though these authors did not directly test glycosylation of the ORF2 protein, a size significantly larger than the predicted size of \u223c72 kDa, suggests this possibility (Ahmad et al. 2011).",

It was reported that the enveloped virus is associated with the ORF3 protein and lipids, but the structure is largely unclear. Further studies are required to evaluate this subject (Ahmad et al. 2011). The ORF3 protein is a small, phosphorylated protein of 113 or 114 amino acids, whose function(s) has not been fully defined. It is dispensable for replication of HEV in vitro in cell lines (Emerson et al. 2006), but is required for infection in the macaque model of experimental infection (Graff et al. 2005). This suggests that the ORF3 protein functions as a viral accessory protein probably affecting the host response. The ability of the ORF3 protein to interactwith multiple cellular proteins suggests its potentialrole in optimizing the cellular environment for viral infection and replication. ORF3 is a versatile, multifunctional protein that activates the extracellular regulated kinase (Erk), a member of the MAPK family, and this depends upon its ability to bind and inactivate an Erk-specific MAPK phosphatase (Kar-Roy et al. 2004).",

However, non-hepatic cell lines such as A549 lung carcinoma cells or Caco-2 colon carcinoma cells also support in vitro replication of HEV. No cellular receptor for HEV has been identified yet. It has been suggested that HEV enters liver cells through receptor-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis, although other entry pathways are also feasible (Kapur et al. 2012). Hsp90 and tubulin appear to be involved in capsid protein intracellular trafficking (Zheng et al. 2010). The virus uncoats to release the viral RNA that is translated in the cytoplasm into nonstructural proteins including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that replicates the positive sense genomic RNA into negative sense transcripts. The latter then act as template for the synthesis of 2.2 kb subgenomic RNA as well as full-length positive viral genomes (Graff et al. 2006).",

The adenoviruses are species-specific and generally replicate only in cells derived from their native host. Human adenoviruses are associated with a variety of infectious diseases affecting the respiratory, urinary and the gastrointestinal tracts and the eyes (Horwitz 2001). To date, 51 serotypes of human adenoviruses have been recognized, which are classified into six subgroups (A to F) based on immunological properties, oncogenicity in rodents, DNA homologies, and morphological properties (Harrach et al. 2011). Adenoviruses have a buoyant density in cesium chloride of 1.33\u20131.34 g/cm3. The capsid is composed of 252 capsomeres, of which 240 are hexons and 12 are pentons. Inside the capsid is a single molecule of linear, double-stranded DNA (Shenk 2001).",

They share the adenovirus group antigen and are distinguished from each other and from other non-enteric serotypes by serology and DNA restriction patterns (Wadell 1984). The enteric serotypes are shed in large numbers from the gut of infected patients and were originally described as being noncultivable or \u2018fastidious\u2019 adenoviruses because they could not be cultivated in routine cell cultures that generally supported the propagation of other adenovirus types. However, it was found that these viruses could be propagated in Graham 293 cells, a cell line of human embryonic kidney (HEK) transformed with adenovirus 5 early (E) region 1 (Graham et al. 1977; Takiff et al. 1981), although at lower levels than other serotypes. This suggests that E1 functions are poorly expressed and therefore it was postulated that the inability of adenovirus types 40 and 41 to grow on cell lines normally supportive for other adenovirus types was due to the relative inability of the adenovirus 41 E1A gene to transactivate other adenovirus 41 genes (Takiff et al. 1984; Van Loon et al. 1985a). The Graham 293 cell retains the E1A and E1B regions of the adenovirus genome covalently linked to the host DNA. The mechanism of facilitation of the growth of the EAd40 in 293 cells seems to be a function of the E1B-55 kDa protein (Mautner et al. 1989). Grabow et al. (1992) reported another cell line (PLC/PRF/5 or primary liver carcinoma cells) also supported an efficient propagation of laboratory strains of adenovirus types 40 and 41. Efficient replication of adenovirus types 40 and 41 has also been achieved in other cell lines, like Hep-2 cells, Chang conjunctiva cells and Caco-2 cells (Perron-Henry et al. 1988; Pinto et al. 1994).",

The main differences between adenovirus 40 and the other human adenovirus serotypes are the presence of two distinct fibre genes, a single VA gene involved in late translation, and a highly divergent E3 region. The adenovirus 41 growth restrictions in cell cultures seem to be less severe than those of serotype 40, as a number of cell lines support the propagation of serotype 41 and not adenovirus 40 (de Jong et al. 1983; Uhnoo et al. 1983; van Loon et al. 1985b). The adenovirus 41 blockade in replication occurs within the early phase of the infectious cycle (Tiemessen et al. 1996). The ability of adenovirus 40 E1A encoded products (proteins 249R and 221R) for trans-activation has also been investigated, (van Loon et al. 1987; Ishino et al. 1988); it has been found that the adenovirus 40 E1A promoter does indeed contain transcription factor binding sites sufficient for trans-activation by the adenovirus 5 E1A 289R protein. It is possible that adenovirus 40 has evolved to use components of the RNA processing machinery that are unique to enterocytes (Stevenson and Mautner 2003).",

Experiments in conjunctival cells suggest that these viruses are defective in their ability to circumvent the antiviral actions induced by IFN (Tiemessen and Kidd 1993). Highly differentiated Caco2 cells were used as a model to determine whether HAdV-40 is sensitive to the effects of type I and type II IFNs. Infection counts showed that HAdV-40 infection rates were reduced significantly when the cells were pre-treated with IFN-\u03b1, compared with those either mock-treated or treated with IFN following infection. Species F adenoviruses may have adapted to tissues that are restricted in their ability to mount an inflammatory cytokine response (Sherwood et al. 2012). Hence, the use of intestinal cell cultures may lead to a better understanding of adenovirus 40 replication and pathogenicity.",

Other enteric viruses like kobuviruses, coronaviruses, toroviruses, and picobirnaviruses also may cause diarrhea, although the causative role for some of these viruses in humans is controversial. In addition, next-generation sequencing technologies have allowed the discovery of new enteric viruses (novel astroviruses, kobuviruses, saliviruses, etc.). Human caliciviruses have been recognized as the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks and sporadic cases in children and adults worldwide. Enteric caliciviruses belonging to the Norovirus and Sapovirus genera still remain refractory to routine cell culture propagation. This limitation has hampered our ability to investigate their biology, pathogenesis, and host immunity, although molecular approaches have provided new insights into these areas. The morphology, composition, and structure of several enteric viruses have been elucidated. Cryo-electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography have been crucial for this purpose. Biochemical and structural studies of virus-like particles produced by recombinant baculoviruses are contributing to a better understanding of the structure-function relationships of the capsid proteins. Viral genome organization is being clarified for all of these viruses, as well as their replication and gene expression strategies. Most of the proteins encoded by the viral genomes have been characterized and their functions identified. Sequence analyses of viral genes have been applied in molecular epidemiology and taxonomy studies. However, many questions still remain to be answered.",

The MNV constitutes an excellent model to analyze HuNoV replication cycle in the laboratory. Biochemical characterization of viral interactions with cells and analysis of the functional properties of the viral proteins are providing a better understanding of the pathogenesis of enteric viruses. Rotavirus NSP4 was the first viral enterotoxin to be characterized. Several cell membrane molecules have been identified recently as being receptors or attachment ligands for different enteric viruses (i.e., integrins and hsc70 for rotaviruses, HBGA carbohydrates for noroviruses). Studies on human susceptibility to norovirus infections have characterized some resistant, non-secretor (Se-) individuals in the population, which is a breakthrough in our knowledge of norovirus-host interactions. Similarly, molecular analyses of orally transmitted viruses causing hepatitis are clarifying the phylogenetic relationships between these viruses and other viral genera, as well as their pathophysiological mechanisms.",
