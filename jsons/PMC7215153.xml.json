Moreover, Italy quickly became one of the countries with the highest COVID-19 infection and victim rates. As of April 8th 2020, more than 139.442 Italians have been infected by COVID-19, and approximately 17.669 have died [2].",

Unpleasant experiences and their related psychological distress would strictly connect with the perception of constrained freedom as a consequence of the quarantine [3].

The survey took approximately 30 min to complete. A short questionnaire collected information on some demographic and COVID-19 related information. Standardized questionnaires to evaluate psychological dimensions were administered. To guarantee anonymity, no personal data, which could allow the identification of participants, was collected. Due to the aim of the current research, having at least 18 years was the only inclusion criterion adopted. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology, \u201cSapienza\u201d University of Rome (protocol number: 0000266). Participants could withdraw from the survey at any moment without providing any justification, and no data were saved. Only data from questionnaires that had a complete set of participant responses were considered. In sum, 98% of respondents (2.291 participants out of 2.332) that started the questionnaires completed the whole survey and were considered for the statistical analyses.",

Extensive research has documented the importance of sleep in restoring neurobehavioral functions and many psychological aspects, including emotion regulation, depression, and anxiety [22]. Moreover, other psychological conditions, such as PTSD and other stress-related disorders, are significantly associated with an impairment of sleep quality [7,22]. Reduced sleep quality negatively affects life satisfaction, health status, social, and emotional domains [23,24]. Additionally, studies have reported an association between poor sleep quality and high risk of falls, infections, or the cold virus as a consequence of a reduction of the immune response [25]. Therefore, investigating sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic became critical to estimate the psychological well-being of the Italian population.

            "text": "Considering other psychological variables, one out of three Italians showed higher generalized anxiety symptoms, and two out of five Italians perceived psychological distress and lower well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. As reported by studies on natural disasters, war crisis, and other epidemic emergencies [26,28], these situations are associated with high levels of anxiety and distress, which represent some of the precursors of the PTSD onset. In our sample, these results have been confirmed. Sleep quality, generalized anxiety, and psychological distress were associated with PTSD symptomatology. Our findings confirmed the results of previous studies on the priority role of disturbed sleep in contributing to the development of PTSD symptoms [29]. Moreover, we confirmed the results of preceding studies on the Chinese population who reported high concomitance of sleep disturbance, psychological distress, and anxiety in the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak, with an increased risk of PTSD occurrence [20,30]. Although further longitudinal studies are necessary, the present findings make us worry about the possible development of PTSD in the Italian population consequent to the COVID-19 emergency.",

Our results, as expected, indicated poor sleep quality, higher levels of generalized anxiety, and higher psychological distress in the Italian population involved in the COVID-19 emergency. Although these results should be considered with caution, given some characteristics of the samples considered, they further confirm the stressful impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of the Italian population. The uncertainty of the epidemic progression, together with the restrictive measures adopted by the Italian Government, is causing higher psychological pressure due to the fear that the epidemic is hard to control. In the first few weeks alone, the COVID-19 pandemic has already had dangerous effects on the Italian population. Our findings suggest that symptoms highlighted above can be a potent risk factor for the development of psychological diseases as previously reported for the Chinese population and accordingly with other studies on epidemic and quarantine conditions [3,31, 32, 33].",

These results are consistent with a study about the psychological impact of the SARS, which demonstrated that residents in the region with the high prevalence of SARS cases have shown higher psychological consequences and were prone to develop PTSD symptomology [34]. People living in high infection-prevalent locations perceive themselves to be at higher risk of infection, as confirmed by the low general health perception reported in the PGWB. Conversely, the lockdown of the transport hub and the overload of the public health system in most cities of North Italy could have led to a detrimental psychological impact on residents impacting on sleep quality and psychological symptomatology. Yet, this relationship has not been clarified. Some studies suggested that people who were repeatedly exposed to traumatic events were prone to suffering from many psychological problems [35]. Other researchers found no relationship between the prolonged exposure to critical events and the gravity of psychological symptoms [36] considering exposure to epidemics [37]. As stated previously, further studies are needed to explore the psychological distress associated with the exposure history of epidemics, considering the restrictive measures adopted to contain the contagion.",

First, the data and results were derived from a cross-sectional design, making causal inferences challenging. In addition, the adoption of the online survey limits the generalizability of the results, although it currently represents the best solution for data collection in times of social distancing. Accordingly, a recruitment bias emerged in our sample, which is characterized by a high number of young adults, mainly students, and women. This aspect should be considered in the interpretation of the results. Especially those variables that were compared with previous data collected on the general population, because these characteristics could be associated with an increased risk of psychopathological conditions. The risk factors analyses have also suggested it. Moreover, some aspects (eg, younger age or being female) could have affected the individual responses to the actual emergency. Considering the statistical comparisons with the general population data, the absence of percentage data on the considered dimensions in the general population did not allow us to compare our percentages in the investigated diseases with the prevalence of sleep disturbance, generalized anxiety, and psychological distress in the general population.",
