Using identical molecular detection methods, we tested 1174 Ghanaian and 539 German children with acute respiratory infections sampled over 12 months for the 15 most common respiratory viruses by PCR. A total 43.2% of the Ghanaian and 56.6% of the German children tested positive for at least one respiratory virus. The pneumoviruses respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus were most frequently detected, in 13.1% and 25.1% within the Ghanaian and German children, respectively. At both study sites, pneumoviruses were more often observed at younger ages (p <0.001). In the Ghanaian rainy season, enveloped viruses were detected twice as often as non-enveloped viruses (prevalence rate ratio (PR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.7-2.4). In contrast, non-enveloped viruses were more frequent during the Ghanaian dry season (PR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.8).

Because Flu A/B detection rates were similar between Germany and Ghana, climatic conditions may have favoured incidence in Germany to a similar extent to the increased contact in Ghana. Contact-mediated transmission in crowded households during the tropical rainy season may also cause a higher incidence of RSV [24] . This is in line with our observation that the detection rate of pneumoviruses in Ghana peaked only in the second of two rainy seasons, coinciding with a higher rainfall at that time compared with the first rainy season.
