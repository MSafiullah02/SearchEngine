These conditions are responsible for the flavor and color in toasted, fried, or baked starchy products. Acrylamide is known as a neurotoxin in humans, and it is classified as a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and its carcinogenic effect has been recently shown (Zhivagi et al. 2019) . Furthermore, it is classified as mutagen by the European Union and added to the list of substances of very high concern by the European Chemical Agency (Palermo et al. 2016) . It is formed mainly from free asparagine and reducing sugars during high-temperature processing of common foods. The main sources of dietary exposure are fried potato, bakery products, breakfast cereals, and coffee (Pedreschi et al. 2014) . A very effective way to substantially reduce acrylamide formation is to convert asparagine to aspartic acid using asparaginase. The use of asparaginase has been suggested as the best approach to reduce acrylamide in food products (Palermo et al. 2016) . Different commercial sources of asparaginase are approved for use in food processing by, e.g., the US FDA (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/ucm374534. pdf). Importantly, this approach effectively reduces the acrylamide contents ( Fig. 7 .1a) while maintaining the organoleptic properties of the different food products (Fig. 7 .1b) using a recombinant asparaginase manufactured using A. oryzae (Acrylaway \u00ae ).",

This results in oil of poor quality while also being problematic in terms of both safety and the environment. Current regulations prohibit manufacturers to use partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs) due to the trans-fat content. The World Health Organization launched a program to reduce PHOs and trans fats globally, as their intake is associated to risk for coronary heart disease (Shin et al. 2009 ). Trans fats are formed when manufacturers use a partial hydrogenation process to give margarines the correct melting properties and shelf stability. The same quality and avoidance of trans fats formation can be obtained using a different process, interesterification. Using enzymatic interesterification gives a more natural, better tasting product that contains healthier oils ( Fig. 7. 2; see below).

The most common chemical catalyst is still either sodium methylate (methoxide) or sodium ethylate (ethoxylate). These chemicals are both highly toxic and explosive. The chemical reaction causes by-product formation (including color, Fig. 7 .2). Therefore, the reaction is followed by washing, bleaching and deodorization. All these are unit operations, which result in yield loss during the process. By-products of chemical interesterification have been identified as dialkyl ketones (Santoro et al. 2018) . Differences between the result of interesterification of a fat blend by chemical and enzymatic interesterification are also partly due to the higher level of diglycerides produced in the chemical process and partly because the enzymatic process does not produce full randomization (Holm et al. 2018) .",

In contrast, gene editing patent numbers increased from 13 to 56 in the period 2013-2015 with a small decrease in 2016 ( Fig. 7.3 ).

A disruption in the endogenous pyrG gene encoding an orotidine-5 0 -phosphate decarboxylase results in the requirement of uridine for growth (Mattern et al. 1989 ).

Although S. cerevisiae has been the subject of extensive research and it Fig. 7 .4 Traditional (a) and modern (genome editing, b) methods for construction of improved host strains. (a) Traditional methods can be based on the use of homologous recombination using upstream and downstream sequences (\"HR\") of the target gene to be deleted (\"Target 1\", \"Target 2\") to flank a selective marker (\"marker\") as indicated. For each target gene, two consecutive steps (1 and 2) are required for integration of the target site (1) and loop out of the marker (2) before a new target gene can be modified using the same selection (3 and 4). (b) Using CRISPR (illustrated with use of the most used Cas9 nuclease, green box), it is feasible to target modification of two or more genes in a single step using gRNAs directed to each target and a plasmid containing suitable expression cassettes for the Cas9 gene and the gRNAs. If the Cas9 expression cassette is introduced on a plasmid containing, e.g., pyrG as the selective marker, subsequent growth of the resulting strains in medium with FOA results in plasmid (Cas9) loss and enables identification of the desired strains. In the depicted example, two target genes are modified in a single step is currently one of the hosts of choice for production of biologicals, the yields typically obtained preclude its use for production of bulk enzymes (Bao et al. 2017 ). Prediction of the most suitable host is still not possible, and rather a screening for multiple hosts is the standard approach whenever possible. As a rule of thumb, the host should be as taxonomically closely related to the donor organism (i.e., where the enzyme gene originates from) as possible. In this way, requirements for the cellular machinery (secretion, protein folding, etc.) should be somewhat similar in the recombinant host. Yields of 20-100 g/L have been published, but they are normally obtained for homologous or near-homologous enzymes (Meyer et al. 2015) . The longer taxonomic distance between the donor organism of the enzyme gene and the host, the lower the likelihood of expression at a feasible level (Singh et al. 2015) .",

A simple and robust process for submerged fermentation is typically used (Fig. 7 .5). Shortly, a cell bank vial (typically a working cell bank, WCB) is used to inoculate a solid medium to generate sufficient spores to inoculate a medium-size seed tank (seed fermenter). This step enables the generation of suitable fungal biomass optimally without induction of enzyme production. The biomass is used as inoculum for the main tank (5000 L or larger) where induction of enzyme production occurs. Growth of filamentous fungi in a fermenter presents a number of challenges in terms of the morphology, pellet vs. dispersed growth, high viscosity, and transfer of oxygen to the cells compared to, e.g., unicellular, round yeast cells or bacteria. High viscosity typically limits oxygen transfer and result in loss of productivity (enzyme yield). Mycelial morphology during fermentation has an important effect on aeration and productivity (Amanullah et al. 2002) . In submerged cultures, the observed macroscopic morphology of filamentous fungi varies from freely dispersed mycelium to dense pellets consisting of a more or less condensed and intertwined network of hyphae. Morphology and productivity are influenced by the environment and can be controlled by inoculum concentration and viability, pH value, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, medium composition, mechanical stress, or process mode as well as through the addition of inorganic salts (Walisko et al. 2015) .",

Two major approaches have been used for this purpose in the last decades to attempt yield increase. The first one is based on classical mutagenesis and screening. Here, the specific genetic modification is not pre-defined. The main requirement is a screening assay that has the sensitivity and range of detection to allow the identification of mutants producing higher enzyme titers. Classical mutagenesis and screening strategies have been used for decades to improve small molecule (Adrio and Demain 2006) and enzyme production. The original Penicillium notatum strain isolated by Fleming contained a single copy of the penicillin biosynthetic genes, and the published yield using optimized strains that contain multiple copies is 70 g/L (Adrio and Demain 2006) . Over several decades, a pedigree of A. niger strains with increased production of glucoamylase (GlaA) was developed by classical mutagenesis. Analysis of this pedigree identified both deletions and amplifications including repeated amplification of a 216 kb region that includes the glaA gene. The highest producing strain contained ten copies of glaA compared to two copies in the original parent strain (Cherry et al. 2010) . High-throughput screening enables large numbers of mutants to be screened in search for the desired phenotype, i.e., higher enzyme yields. The increase in copy number typically leads to an increase in product formation, but it also reaches a maximum when transcription is not limiting and other cellular processes like secretion become a bottleneck (Gressler et al. 2015) . Overview of a generic recovery process for enzyme production. The fermented broth undergoes different steps to remove the cellular debris (flocculation, filtration, or centrifugation). Subsequently the product can be concentrated by ultrafiltration. Product stabilizers are added prior to filter sterilization (bacterial filtration).

The stronger the promoter, the lower the requirement for copy number of the expression cassette to be inserted into the production strain to reach optimal enzyme titers. The advantages of using a regulated promoter include the possibility to design a fermentation process composed of a biomass production phase followed by induction of enzyme production. Strong and regulated promoters can be identified, e.g., looking at relatively abundant enzymes or mRNAs. The great majority of highly expressed genes include those encoding secreted enzymes that are an essential part of the life strategy of fungi, i.e., for degradation of polymers such as cellulose, starch, etc. Yoder and Lehmbeck 2004) . Examples of promoters that are used in industrial enzyme production include the Trichoderma reesei cbhI promoter (P cbhI ), the A. oryzae TAKA amylase (P TAKA ; Christensen et al. 1988 ) and the A. niger neutral amylase, and glucoamylase promoters (P amyB and P glaA ). All the above promoters are strong and regulated. Induction is obtained in medium containing cellulose-like substrates like sophorose (P cbhI ) or starch, maltose, and maltodextrin (P TAKA , P glaA , or P amyB ). They are all subjected to carbon catabolite repression (CCR), and their use may negatively affect productivity as glucose is produced during growth. Many industrial fungal hosts have therefore been mutated in functions regulating CCR. One example is the mutation identified in the cre1 gene in T. reesei strains that produce cellulase during growth in glucose. Cre1 is the major CCR transcription factor that binds to a specific motif present in promoter of genes involved in glucose repression. Introducing the mutation in a production strain increases the enzyme yield without affecting growth (Nakari-Set\u00e4l\u00e4 et al. 2009 ).",

Other promoters like the Aspergillus tet-on/tet-off system are useful for research purposes rather than for industrial production (Wanka et al. 2016; Kluge et al. 2018 ). As mentioned above, a source of novel promoters may be obtained investigating mRNA levels and choosing the promoter of the highest expressed genes under relevant growth conditions.

Since this publication, research has broadened the understanding of secretion in filamentous fungi; however, many reports on attempts to improve \"secretion\" of a protein have been published, and no broadly successful strategy to manipulate the secretion pathway exists. Therefore, secretion optimization is probably one of the most challenging tasks to increase enzyme yields. Fungi like A. niger and A. oryzae adapt the protein load in the secretory pathway, probably as an evolutionary advantage of their lifestyle in nature. In addition, we continue to learn unique aspects of secretion in fungi as exemplified by recent insights into protein trafficking in A. nidulans. A genetic dissection of the exocytic pathway in A. nidulans has been described. It reveals numerous and yet unexplored cellular functions like Rab1and Sed5 (early Golgi), Sec7 and Trs120 (trans Golgi network), and Rab5 (early endosome) among others (Hernandez-Gonzalez et al. 2018) .",

Screening of different known signal peptides to find the most suitable sequence can be performed as described for the yeast Pichia pastoris. Although some signal peptides (e.g., the sequence derived from the yeast mating factor) result in an overall higher yield in yeast, no secretion was obtained using this sequence for other proteins (Obst et al. 2017) . Suitable SPs may be obtained by identifying the secreted proteins of a fungal host and selecting the SP of the most abundant ones , although in vivo screening is needed as theoretical values generated by SignalP (a prediction software for SPs) are not associated with high levels of secretion in yeast (Mori et al. 2015) .",

Some SM display antimicrobial or antioxidant activity and are used as a defense mechanism in nature. These compounds are normally not produced during growth in the laboratory or in large-scale growth in a fermenter. Mycotoxins are a small group of SM representing a health risk for animal and humans. Mycotoxins are acutely or chronically toxic and pose health hazards or death in humans and other vertebrates when acquired in small amounts via a natural route, i.e., orally, by inhalation, or via the skin (Frisvad et al. 2018) . Genes responsible for mycotoxin biosynthesis are normally grouped in gene clusters. Although mycotoxin production is not normally associated to submerged growth of pure cultures, the potential for production of these compounds can be eliminated by deletion of the responsible gene cluster resulting in strains with a reduced toxigenic potential. To do this, the genes responsible for production of the mycotoxin need to be identified. In A. oryzae, two neighboring gene clusters involved in the synthesis of cyclopiazonic acid and aflatoxin, respectively, have been removed from the genome in production strains (Christensen et al. 1999; Olempska-Beer et al. 2006) . Similarly, genes responsible for production of most relevant fungal mycotoxins like fumonisin and ochratoxin (Khaldi and Wolfe 2011; Gill-Serna et al. 2018 ) are known, and strains lacking the potential to produce them can be engineered.",

Many of the industrial fungal host species produce one or more secreted enzymes at reasonable titers, i.e., amylase, cellulases, and glucoamylase by A. niger, A. oryzae, and T. reesei. This ability to produce high levels of a secreted enzyme(s) has been exploited both for production of these native enzymes as well as for heterologous enzymes. In strains producing a heterologous enzyme, genes coding for abundant native secreted enzymes are deleted or classical mutants that are unable to produce the native enzymes have been isolated. T. reesei produces a complex set of cellulases and hemicellulases that provides the capability to degrade lignocellulose. Deletion of the most abundant enzyme cellobiohydrolase I (cbh1) gene leads to an increase in production of cellobiohydrolase II (cbh2), whereas deletion of endoglucanase I or endoglucanase II increased levels of both cbh1 and cbh2 (Seiboth et al. 1997 ).",

RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease can be used to cleave any DNA sequence in a fungal host with high specificity, and repair of the double-strand breaks can be mediated by error-prone, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or by the introduction of specific changes via homologous recombination using donor DNA. In strains deficient in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), highly efficient marker-free gene targeting can be performed. Even singlestranded oligonucleotides work efficiently as repair templates for Cas9-induced DNA double-strand breaks in different Aspergillus species (N\u00f8dvig et al. 2018) . This indicates that this type of repair may be widespread in filamentous fungi. Using oligonucleotides for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing, it is now possible to introduce specific point mutations as well as gene deletions at efficiencies approaching 100%. In A. nidulans, up to three editing events can be achieved in one transformation (N\u00f8dvig et al. 2018) .",

In this way, strain construction can be accelerated and expression results from a large number of unique strains can be used to begin to develop machine learning models to predict optimal expression cassette elements and genome modifications. Systems biology provides rational approaches and analytical tools to understand complex biological processes like manufacture of industrial enzymes using fungal cell factories and to enable production of novel molecules (Martins-Santana et al. 2018; Hammer and Avalos 2017) . Mathematical modeling is central in systems biology to integrate information and quantitatively analyze phenotypes to enable predictions about the behavior of the organism or elucidating mechanisms underlying experimental observations. For this purpose, a genome model of the host species provides the \"scaffold\" for the integration of the large datasets that are generated and that enable computational predictions (Campbell et al. 2017) .

Using protein localization tags, beneficial modifications (by engineering the cellular location of the reaction) of the metabolic flux can be obtained (Martins-Santana et al. 2018) .

Thus, auxotrophic markers or markers that enable growth in specific nitrogen or carbon sources have been introduced, e.g., the amdS gene (Christensen et al. 1988) . Genetic stability issues have also resulted in the scarcity of strains constructed using free replicating plasmid based on, e.g., the Aspergillus AMA1 fragment (Aleksensko and Clutterbuck 1997) . Even though transformation frequencies are much lower than for free replicating plasmids, current production strains are therefore constructed using chromosomal integration. Because NHEJ is the dominant mechanism for DNA integration in industrial fungal strains, initially, production strains were the result of ectopic (nonhomologous) integration. The regulatory requirement-determination of the site of integration of the expression cassette-has driven the construction of strains through homologous recombination at one of more defined chromosomal locations. A suitable host strain should harbor multiple and reusable integration loci (i.e., a \"plug and play\" system) in such a way that newly identified yield improvements can be readily incorporated to produce different enzymes (Udagawa 2017) .",

The estimated savings if the world's textile industry implements the whole range of available enzymatic solutions in the production of cotton textiles include 28% of water consumption which is 1250 billion liters of water. Additionally, the use of textile enzymes will save 80% of chemical consumption-that is, 10 mn tons of chemicals-and up to 25% of the energy consumption.

Contrary to biopharmaceuticals, industrial enzymes are typically not purified products but rather derive from a concentrated fermentation broth where the production organism has been removed. This principle of \"contained use\" where the enzyme product does not contain material from the production organism is important for the classification of the product and requirements from regulatory authorities. Furthermore, the use of antibiotic resistance genes as selective markers for strain construction should be avoided due to concerns of its transferability and effect on the spread of resistance to antibiotics normally used to treat infections in humans.",

A regulatory authority (European Commission, Directorate General for Health and Consumers) and an advisory scientific body responsible for the risk assessment [EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)] participate in the approval process to ensure, e.g., the safety of GM food products for animal and human consumption (Aguilera et al. 2013 ). These regulations were introduced in 2009 and reached a key milestone on March 11, 2015, the first deadline for food enzyme manufacturers to submit dossiers on all food enzymes currently sold or used in Europe under the new regulation. More than 300 enzyme dossiers were submitted. These submissions are required to ensure compliance of the enzyme industry and its customers when FIAP gets fully implemented in 2021. An update of the requirements for the characterization of the production strain has recently been implemented (EFSA 2018). For enzymes manufactured using a recombinant strain, a comprehensive description of the genetic elements and methods used to construct the strain from a publicly available parental strain is required. One major aspect is the requirement to demonstrate the absence of the production organism and DNA in the final enzyme product to enable the approval as a Category 2 product (\"Complex products in which both GMMs and newly introduced genes are no longer present\") as opposed to the use of, e.g., a recombinant organism directly in the food. To issue an opinion on the safety of the enzyme, EFSA requires-among many other aspects relating to, e.g., the technical need or calculation of the margin of safety for intake-a description of each modification step from the parental to the actual production strain, in addition to data on the taxonomical identification, safety, pathogenicity, toxicological studies, history of safe use, genetic stability and the absence of vector or any other sequence used during construction steps that is not intended for insertion into the genome, etc. (Aguilera et al. 2013) .",

Requirements for strain description and characterization are not as comprehensive as in other geographies. The data included in the enzyme dossier can be accessed by third parties following the freedom of information act (FOIA, a federal law that allows for the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased information and documents controlled by agencies like FDA). This has direct consequences on the extent of the information that enzyme manufactures can disclose on, e.g., strain construction and gene expression technology in a GRAS notification.",

Currently, data on the absence of DNA in the enzyme product that has been a requirement in Europe and Japan for several years, are also requested in China. Although FIAP has created a comprehensive, high-level standard for the characterization of production strains, countries like China have additional requirements compared to, e.g., FIAP that include a comprehensive genetic and expression stability study that spans to five consecutive cultivations of the production strain. Similarly, a requirement to identify the chromosomal location of the inserted DNA exists in Japan. Although technically feasible with novel sequencing technology, this can be rather challenging if the production strain is constructed using ectopic integration in multiple copies at single or multiple locations, considering the relatively high level of repeated DNA sequences in a fungal genome. Finally, alignment of requirements between regulatory authorities would enable the characterization of the production strain and the submission of dossiers according to one standard. As an example, the modification of the host strain can be described with less detail in a GRAS notification than in a FIAP dossier where each step needs to be described in detail and supported with data confirming that the modification has happened as intended. Alignment of requirements for strain characterization in enzyme dossiers would represent a tremendous advantage for industrial biotechnology companies.",

Assigning functions to these genes using the appropriate method (transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.) will improve the knowledge about the biology and physiology of the host strains and contribute to our understanding of protein production and secretion in filamentous fungi.",
