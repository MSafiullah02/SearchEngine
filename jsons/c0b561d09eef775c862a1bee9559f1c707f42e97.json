First, we find that the impact of lockdown is stronger in municipalities with higher fiscal capacity. Second, we find a segregation effect, since mobility restrictions are stronger in municipalities for which inequality is higher and where individuals have lower income per capita.",

As shown in (2) , mobility trends have reduced in fact by more than 90% in Italy after the lockdown, both in the retail and tourism sectors and in the service one, and this disruption of the mobility toward the workplace supports the use of mobility flows as a proxy of economic damages. Furthermore, we want to investigate the geographic distribution of the shocks in order to identify the economic conditions of the most and least affected zones. Rather than a homogeneous distribution we find, on the one side, that mobility reduction induced by lockdown is stronger for municipalities with higher fiscal capacity. On another side, we find that the contraction in mobility is higher for municipalities with lower per capita income and for those with higher inequality. In the aftermath of the crisis, central governments need not only to sustain economic recovery, but also to compensate the loss of local fiscal capacity, while channeling resources to mitigate the impact of lockdown on poverty and inequality.",

We further assess the impact of mobility restrictions leveraging a network-based representation of mobility data and computing the network efficiency (Materials and Methods). Efficiency (19) is a good proxy of the system dynamics at play. Indeed, it is a global network measure that combines the information deriving from the network cohesiveness and the distance among the nodes and it measures how efficiently information/individuals may travel over the network (20) . Additionally, it is particularly suitable for treating graphs with multiple components that evolve over time (21) . As shown in Fig In the following, we use the variation in Nodal Efficiency (Material and Methods), that is the contribution of each node to the global network efficiency, as a proxy for the effects of mobility restrictions. We compute the percentage relative change induced by the lockdown, by constructing mobility networks in two windows, 15 days before and after the day of intervention.",

This allows us to concentrate on the dynamic at the tails of the distribution and to capture effects that with linear methods would otherwise seem insignificant (9) . Indeed our estimates at the top and bottom quantile of the distribution of the variation in Nodal Efficiency show a better fitting with respect to the OLS ones reported as reference in Table 1 We observe a significant and positive relation between change in mobility during the lock- Two seemingly opposite patterns emerge: individual indicators (average Income) show that the poorest are those more exposed to the economic consequences of the lockdown; on the contrary, aggregate indicators at the level of municipalities, i.e. Deprivation and Fiscal Capacity, reveal that richer municipality are those more hit by mobility contraction induced by the lockdown.",

Moreover, at the upper end of the distribution, the relation is reversed. This asymmetry of the joint distribution of mobility contraction and Income per Capita unravels the existence of a possible segregation effect: even though some of the richer urban centers have experienced greater casualty rates, low income individuals are more affected by the economic consequences of the lockdown.When we move to the analysis of municipal characteristics, measured through Deprivation and Fiscal Capacity, we find a different result: municipalities relatively richer in terms of social indicators and availability of own financial resources are those more hit by the loss in mobility efficiency in the aftermath of the lockdown. In other words, municipalities which experience the strongest effect of the lockdown are those with higher Fiscal Capacity and lower aggregate Deprivation.",
