This nucleoside analogue has been used topically to treat eye and skin infections caused by herpes simplex virus. There was slow progress in the discovery and development of new antiviral drugs for a number of years until the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections as a major threat to human health worldwide. Research in the HIV field has led to approval of more than 30 antiretroviral drugs in the last three decades. As a consequence of these advances HIV infection and AIDS have become a chronic rather than a fatal disease in many parts of the world.",

More recently (in December 2013), the HCV RNA polymerase inhibitor, sofosbuvir, received approval after showing that it could cure HCV infection in at least 90% of the treated patients, if properly combined with ribavirin or other more recently approved directly acting agents.",

There are important viral infections that lack effective treatments. For example, dengue virus infects millions of people in more than 100 countries, and causes a severe disease that claims around 25,000 lives every year. Effective antiviral drugs are also missing for other viruses that cause alarm and havoc because of their high mortality (e.g. Ebola virus or Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus). In addition, the periodic emergence of new (more pathogenic) strains of known viruses, or previously unknown viruses presents continuing concerns for public health and reminders of the need for effective treatments.",

About 15% of the approximately 300 million people infected with HCV worldwide will end up suffering serious complications of hepatitis C. For many years, the only approved therapies were combinations of interferon and ribavirin. However, only about 60% of treated patients showed substantial responses to treatment due to host and viral factors that limit their efficacy. Discontinuation of interferon treatment is not uncommon due to severe side effects including fatigue, headache, fever, myalgias, and depression. Failure with interferon has been observed in many patients, but interferon-resistance mutational patterns are rather complex and difficult to predict. In their review, Perales et al. [1] discuss amino acid replacements found in different HCV proteins upon passage of the virus in the presence or absence of interferon \u03b1. Interferon resistance in HCV is far more complex than resistance to directly acting antiviral agents such as boceprevir or telaprevir. Determinants of interferon resistance locate at specific residues of the HCV core protein, as well as the interferon sensitivity determining region (ISDR) and the interferon and ribavirin resistance determining region (IRRDR), both located within the viral NS5A protein. However, there are coincidences and discrepancies in the literature related to specific mutations and amino acid substitutions conferring resistance, and it is clear that environmental conditions have a major impact on the mutational patterns observed.",

In their review, Beaucourt and Vignuzzi [2] describe ribavirin resistant and susceptible variants in different RNA viruses (e.g. poliovirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, Chikungunya virus and HCV). Some of these variants result in viruses having polymerases with higher or lower fidelity. These variants could be helpful to improve the efficacy of current mutagenic compounds and identify new drugs with previously unknown antiviral mutagenic activity.",

In his review, G\u00f6tte [4] describes mutational patterns associated with resistance to sofosbuvir and other nucleoside inhibitors in clinical development. A key amino acid substitution involved in resistance to many of these drugs is S282T. However, it is only transiently observed in clinical cases. Alternative resistance pathways probably involving polymorphic sites could be relevant for the acquisition of resistance to these drugs.

The review by Lim and Gallay [5] focuses on drugs in advanced clinical trials acting on this protein whose role in HCV replication and propagation has not been completely elucidated. NS5A has three domains, and drugs such as daclatasvir or ledipasvir select for mutations in domain I, while resistance to alisporivir maps in domain II. Daclatasvir and ledipasvir are directly acting antiviral agents with a low genetic barrier that block RNA replication and virion assembly. Alisporivir binds cyclophilin A and disrupts its interaction with NS5A. In contrast to directly acting antiviral agents, alisporivir has a higher barrier of resistance. However, its efficiency has to be further validated in clinical studies.",

HBV and HIV reverse transcriptases share important biochemical and structural properties and drugs designed to inhibit the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase were found to be successful inhibitors of the HBV polymerase. Men\u00e9ndez-Arias et al. [6] provide an overview of the mechanisms of action of approved nucleos(t)ide inhibitors of HBV polymerase, the development of resistance to those drugs and some insight into the development of novel compounds targeting HBV genome replication. Significant advances in these lines of research have allowed the use of drugs with a very slow rate of development of drug resistance (e.g. entecavir and tenofovir). As in the case of the HIV infection, future challenges in the treatment of HBV infection include the eradication of the virus.",

The huge death toll of the 1918 influenza pandemic and the rapid global spread of the virus are major factors contributing to this perception. Effective antiviral drugs will be required whenever the situation becomes alarming. However, there are not many effective drugs and the quick development of resistance is major drawback of available therapies. In his review, Hurt [8] notes how resistance to M2 ion channel inhibitors (e.g. amantadine and rimantadine) was quickly selected after their extensive usage, and provides a detailed review on the emergence and quick propagation of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A (H1N1) viruses. This is attributed to the relatively low impact on viral fitness of the resistance-associated substitution H275Y, in the influenza virus neuraminidase. A few studies also suggest that development of resistance to related drugs such as zanamivir or laninamivir is likely to occur at a slower pace, but in the absence of large clinical trials this is still an unsolved question. As pointed out for oseltamivir, the development of resistance could be also dependent on the specific serotype.",
