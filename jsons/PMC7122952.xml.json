The ORF1 encodes a polyprotein with approximately 200 kDa that is cleaved by the cysteine proteinase, encoded by the virus genome. The cleaved polyprotein gives origin to six nonstructural proteins, including the 2C helicase, 3C protease, and 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The ORF2 and ORF3 encode two structural proteins that are, respectively, the VP1, which is the major capsid protein, and the VP2, a minor structural protein that is responsible for the virus genome packaging. The VP1 is functionally divided into shell (S) and protrusion (P) domains. The last is divided into P1, which is formed by two noncontiguous regions, and the hypervariable P2 that is inserted between the P1 subregions (Fig. 6.3) (Jiang et al. 1993; Ettayebi and Hardy 2003). A fourth ORF, tentatively named virulence factor 1 (VF1), which encodes a protein involved in the regulation of innate immune response has been described in the murine NoV genome (McFadden et al. 2011).\n",

Since the porcine NoV strains have grouped only into these three genotypes, it was suggested that these strains have been adapted and its occurrence is restricted to pigs (L\u2019Homme et al. 2009). However, the porcine NoV GII.18 was shown to be genetically and antigenically most closely related to human GII NoV, raising questions of whether pigs may be reservoirs for emergence of new human NoV strains (Wang et al. 2005).

Since the bovine NoV GIII.1 causes severe villus atrophy and loss of mature enterocytes, it was suggested that these facts may limit the infection duration due to the reduction in the number of susceptible cells to the virus infection (Otto et al. 2011). On the other hand, the bovine NoV GIII.2 experimental studies showed that calves shed the NoV in faeces for at least 30 days after inoculation, regardless of the faecal consistency (diarrhoeic or not) and the duration of the clinical signs (Jor et al. 2010; Jung et al. 2014). Diarrhoea and prolonged faecal shedding of bovine NoV GIII.2 were observed even in calves that were not presented with major histological changes in the intestine, including no necrosis of intestinal epithelium, villous atrophy, or inflammatory lesions (Jung et al. 2014).",

The murine NoV-1 infection in knockout mice for recombination-activating gene 2 (RAG2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1) genes, RAG2/STAT-1, showed tropism for haematopoietic cell (macrophages and dendritic cells) and development of systemic disease. Clinical signs include pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, and vasculitis in brain capillaries and can be observed even in inoculation in serial passages (Karst et al. 2003; Wobus et al. 2006; Scipioni et al. 2008b). It was also demonstrated that the murine NoV can naturally infect wild and immunodeficient mice. The infection also occurs following oral or intranasal inoculation. However, although other strains of murine NoV have already been isolated from faecal samples of infected mice, it is not yet clear whether this virus is an effective enteric pathogen in this animal species (Hsu et al. 2005).",

The ELISA is the most frequently EIA used for animal NoV infection diagnosis. Hyperimmune polyclonal serum obtained after animal (mice, rabbits, guinea pigs) immunisation with VLPs is used as capture antibody for the ELISA-based detection of viral antigen (Scipioni et al. 2008b). The large amounts of viral soluble proteins in stool are likely responsible for the sensitivity of antigen ELISA similar to that of conventional RT-PCR. However, the hyperimmune anti-VLP serum is often highly specific with the homologous strains or viruses within the same genotype, which make the technique highly specific (Wang et al. 2007). This fact limits the use of the technique in diagnostic laboratories, since there are highly diverse NoV strains in circulation (Wang et al. 2007; Scipioni et al. 2008b). Despite this, antigen ELISA is useful for screening large number of samples since it is a rapid and simple test (Scipioni et al. 2008b) and can be used for epidemiological-based studies from host species in which larger antigenic and/or molecular NoV genomic variations were not identified.",

The fluid and electrolyte therapies are easier to be implemented for calves relative to piglets. For piglets, oral products intended to re-establish the hydroelectrolytic balance can be used. In cases in which severe diarrhoea is present, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is recommended to avoid/control secondary infections. It is likely that maternal antibodies in colostrum and milk limit infection and damage in the gut of nursing piglets. Even not preventing infection, the colostrum intake may have some impact in the bovine NoV infection by limiting the infection dissemination and reducing the severity and duration of diarrhoea (Otto et al. 2011).
