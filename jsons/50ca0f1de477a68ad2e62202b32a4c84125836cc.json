We prospectively compared the performance of Cobas Liat Influenza A/B and RSV assay (LIAT) with our routine multiplexNAT-1 (xTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel; Luminex) and multiplexNAT-2 (ePlex-RPP; GenMark Diagnostics) using 194 consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with influenza-like illness during winter 2017/2018.

LIAT was positive for influenza virus-A, -B, and RSV in 18 (9.3%), 13 (6.7%), and 55 (28.4%) samples, and negative in 108 samples. Other CARVs were detected by multiplexNAT in 66 (34.0%) samples.

DAD is rapid, but had been shown to be of limited sensitivity compared to VIC. 3, 4 In the past, VIC has been the gold standard for sensitive and specific identification of community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARVs) including influenza viruse and RSV. However, VIC requires skilled technicians, dedicated cell culture equipments, and a TAT of several days, which limits the use of this technique to specialized laboratories. 5 By contrast, NAT has the advantage of a shorter TAT of approximately 6 to 8 hours, and the detection of multiple pathogens by parallel testing in a semiquantitative format and as multiplexNAT. More recently, NAT platforms became available for detecting influenza viruse as point-ofcare tests (POCTs). 3, 6, 7 Besides short TAT of less than 2 hours, cartridge-based POCTs are simple to operate, which permit their use in near-patient settings without extensive laboratory training.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 172, "end": 174, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 175, "end": 176, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 446, "end": 448, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 449, "end": 450, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 796, "end": 797, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1101, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1102, "end": 1104, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1106, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "However, negative results are difficult to interpret since POCT J Med Virol. 2019;91:582-587. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jmv may have a limited sensitivity or the influenza-like illnesses in question may be due to other CARVs not covered by the POCT.

The LIAT and the multiplexNAT results were directly entered into the laboratory information system for electronic documentation and validation. The detection limit of the LIAT was evaluated using twofold serial dilutions of patient samples containing influenza virus-A, -B, or RSV. For influenza virus-A, the LIAT detected a dilution corresponding to 5000 copies/mL, for influenza virus-B a dilution of 1250 copies/mL, and for RSV a dilution containing 2500 copies/mL. The prospective study consisted of 194 respiratory samples consecutively submitted for routine testing of 194 patients presenting with influenza-like illness between November 2017 and January 2018 (Figure 1). The majority of patients was 16 years or younger (167; 86.1%) and approximately half of them were male (104; 53.1%). The median age of the patients was 1 year (25th percentile [Q1], 2 months; 75 th percentile [Q3], 7 years; range, 2 weeks to 87 years) (Table 1). By LIAT, 86 of 194 (44.3%) samples were positive consisting of influenza virus-A in 18 (9.3%), influenza virus-B in 13 (6.7%), and RSV in 55 (28.4%) cases.

The LIAT showed a sensitivity of 100% for all three pathogens. The specificity reached 100% for influenza virus-A, 99.5% for influenza virus-B, and 100% for RSV when compared with multiplexNAT and QNAT.
