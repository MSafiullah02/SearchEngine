            "text": "Human exposure to contaminated water environment for drinking, recreational as well as agricultural purposes such as crop irrigation and food processing can result in water-related disease. Waterborne pathogens and related diseases are a major public health concern. In addition to mortality related to waterborne diseases due to pathogens, their prevention and treatment cause a considerable cost to the community. Despite state-of-art technologies in water treatment processes, waterborne outbreaks are still a critical challenge globally. Therefore, proper detection of pathogens in water bodies and appropriate monitoring of water quality play key roles in decision-making regarding water supply, water treatment processes, and distribution systems' infrastructure. Although most bacterial species are nonpathogen and even beneficial to environmental processes, there are about hundred bacterial species that cause infectious diseases in human. Pathogenic bacteria are capable of causing disease when enter into the body and can spread through water, air, soil, and physical contact. Although many bacterial pathogens causing diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, cholera, and dysentery have been controlled, many new bacterial pathogens have been recognized and many multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been reemerged. Waterborne bacterial pathogens of primary concern include species of Salmonella, Shigella, Clostridium, Legionella, Yersinia, and Mycobacterium families. Viruses are also a major cause of water-related diseases. The most common viral pathogens causing gastrointestinal illnesses are rotavirus and norovirus (Scallan et ANNUAL LITERATURE REVIEW al., 2011) . However, a wide variety of viruses may be found in human sewage. They can be categorized into single-strand RNA (ssRNA) such as enterovirus, hepatovirus, norovirus, sapovirus, and coronavirus; single-strand DNA (ssDNA) such as parvovirus and circovirus; and double-strand DNA (dsDNA) such as mastadenovirus and polyomavirus.",

            "text": "Moreover, World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized somatic coliphages, male-specific RNA coliphages (F-RNA phages), and Bacteroides' phages as indicators of water quality. Somatic phage group contains a big family of lytic phages with single or double-stranded DNA genomes (Hodgson, Torok, & Turnbull, 2017) . These bacteriophages attach the coliform cell wall as the specific host, which may infect warm-blooded animals and duplicate in the gastrointestinal tract. Similar to the somatic coliphages, both F-RNA and Bacteroides phages replicate in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals. However, Bacteroides only survive and reproduce under anaerobic condition with specific nutritional requirements in the gastrointestinal tract. Besides, F-RNA and Bacteroides have other different features. For instance, F-RNA phages are single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), while Bacteroides phages contain double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes with long contractile tails. In general, F-RNA phages, also known as F-specific phages, are considered as effective indicators of enteric virus in most environments and treatment processes. Comparing somatic coliphage with F-specific coliphage, Jofre, Lucena, Blanch, and Muniesa (2016) studied various perspectives, including their population in different pollution sources, treatment methods, and persistence in different environments. Under most of the circumstances, somatic phages outnumbered the F-specific phages. Jofre and colleagues detected about 5 \u00d7 10 6 to 10 7 plaque-forming units (PFUs) per 100 ml of somatic phages in the raw municipal wastewater, while F-specific phages were significantly lower with 10 4 to 10 6 PFUs per 100 ml. Furthermore, somatic phages were reported predominate in both surface water and groundwater. Besides, after the secondary treatment, both bacteriophages could be eliminated by 50%-99.9%, with 10 3 to 10 5 PFUs per 100 ml of somatic phages and 10 2 to 5 \u00d7 10 4 PFUs per 100 ml of F-specific phages remained in secondary effluent.",

Some researchers (Jofre et al., 2016) (2017) considered Enterococci phages as potential fecal indicators, surviving in both fresh and marine water in tropical and subtropical regions. Except for Enterococci phages, both somatic phages and F-specific phages were detected in freshwater and marine water. Notably, somatic phages significantly outnumbered the F-specific phages. However, further investigation is essential to define Enterococci phages as indicator of fecal pollution due to the limited studied regions. They also indicated that somatic phages and F-specific phages had the highest concentrations than any other bacteriophages, such as Bacteroides and Enterococci phages. Moreover, they determined the removal rate in the wastewater treatment process and showed somatic phages, F-specific coliphages, and Bacteroides phages had similar reduction, while fecal coliform and E. coli as fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) showed significantly higher reduction than bacteriophages. Therefore, it is concluded that bacteriophages can act as a robust surrogate for evaluating human viral pathogen removal via wastewater treatment. Dias, Ebdon, and Taylor (2018) detected FIB, bacteriophages (somatic, F-RNA, and B. fragilis), and viral pathogens in activated sludge and trickling filter systems, and they also concluded that FIB was removed more efficiently than phages but noticed that FIB was less effective to indicate the removal of viral pathogens in the systems than phages. However, no correlation was found between indicator organisms and viral pathogens.",

Comparing with Enterococcus population, F + coliphage was discovered to be better associated with gastrointestinal illness. Further, it was shown that F + RNA coliphage Genotype II was significantly related to gastrointestinal illness in one of the water bodies. Yamahara, Sassoubre, Goodwin, and Boehm (2012) evaluated the decay rate of F + coliphage, which indicated relatively higher than FIB or other pathogen indicators. They investigated the occurrence and persistence of FIB and pathogens from 53 California beaches by using qPCR as a culture-independent method. From the collections of dry sand samples, F + coliphages showed a first-order decay rate of 0.42/day, while other FIB and pathogens indicator resulted in much lower decay rate. Vijayavel et al. (2014) focused on monitoring the quality of recreation water and wastewater in Great Lakes region by comparing new Enterococcus host strains with F + coliphage and concluded that their new designed Enterococcus host strains (ENT-49 and ENT-55) have similar detection level compared to F + coliphage. In general, F + coliphage and Enterococcus were present at higher concentrations in wastewater, while low at rivers and harbors.",

In the last few years, some of the research studies have focused on microbial quality characterization and detection of pathogens in reclaimed water. Zhu et al. (2019) investigated the fecal indicators and pathogenic bacteria in both reclaimed water and return flow (i.e., surface and subsurface water that leaves the field following the application of irrigation water) and detected E. coli, total coliform and enterococci as the fecal indicator in the reclaimed water. On the other hand, irrigation return flows contained a significant amount of bacterial indicators, which were significantly higher than EPA criteria measured at 126 colony-forming unit (CFU)/100 ml. In addition, Salmonella as the pathogenic bacteria was found in the return flows with the highest 4.6 most probable number (MPN)/L. However, they did not find a significant relationship between the fecal indicator and Salmonella concentration. Garner et al. (2018) detected and compared five opportunistic pathogens including Acanthamoeba spp., Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Naegleria fowleri, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in both reclaimed (nonpotable ANNUAL LITERATURE REVIEW reuse) and potable water system. They used qPCR to quantify specific 16s rRNA gene markers representing their microbial community structure. It was discovered that Legionella spp., Mycobacterium spp., and their 16s rRNA genes were more abundant in reclaimed water (3.4-4.4 log gene copies/ml) than potable water (1.7 log gene copies/ml). In addition, there were 2.5-3.7 log gene copies/ml of Mycobacterium spp. in the reclaimed water.

According to a survey of 40 cooling towers in Japan, 73% of the towers contained Legionella spp. while fewer abundance of Legionella spp. was reported to survive at 70\u00b0C in the water heaters. Furthermore, Kulkarni et al. (2017) analyzed water samples by exploring total bacterial community from conventional wastewater treatment plants, spray irrigation site with UV and open-air storage treatment. This study concluded that opportunistic pathogens such as Legionella and Mycobacterium were not able to be removed and regrew in reclaimed water systems. In fact, the cluster of Legionella spp. was observed an increasing population in the effluent, comparing with their concentrations in the influent, while UV disinfection could not inhibit the growth of Legionella spp. as well as Mycobacterium spp.",

Therefore, in this review, we have only discussed culture-independent methods which are increasingly developing in the last few years. The culture-independent methods are typically based on the detection and quantification of specific segments of the DNA or RNA in the waterborne pathogen's genome.

In addition to detection of waterborne pathogens with the microarray, it was shown that the microarray correlated with qPCR and culturebased methods.

Total 82 Salmonella Paratyphi and 21 Salmonella Heidelberg patterns ANNUAL LITERATURE REVIEW were isolated, and both species resulted in over 85% similarity by comparing genotypes. However, they noticed that the capability of PFGE was decreasing to some serotypes such as Salmonella enteritidis. Hence, they suggested using other techniques including multilocus sequence typing (MLST), multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analyses (MLVA), and repetitive element palindromic PCR (rep-PCR), along with PFGE can result in more reliable outcome. In two recent studies, PFGE technique has been combined with MLST (Kleta et al., 2017) and MLVA (Sharapov et al., 2016) to detect Listeria monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7, respectively.",

Mitochondrial DNA appears in multiple copies in the cell, and therefore, it is relatively easy to amplify and quantify. He et al. (2016) evaluated five microbial DNA (mDNA) and four mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers from human and pig via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. In this study, sensitivities, specificities, concentrations, and decay rates of mDNA and mtDNA were evaluated and it showed that majority of mDNA had lower sensitivities than mtDNA. In addition, mtDNA was shown to have relatively higher specificities (98%) compared to mDNA specificities (92%). Furthermore, the decay rate of DNA markers was evaluated in various temperatures, which showed a significant increase in the decay rate in higher temperature. In another study, Villemur, Imbeau, Vuong, Masson, and Payment (2015) extracted DNA from surface water samples of 82 watersheds to evaluate human, bovine and porcine mtDNA markers as well as Bacteroidales HF183 marker via PCR method. Based on their results, it was suggested that mitoHu (human mitochondrial DNA marker) and HF183 can be applied in source tracking. In another study, Pasha et al. (2018) also concluded that HF183 was correlated with coliforms with correlation coefficient of 0.79. They obtained water samples from a wastewater treatment plant in South Texas, and used BacHum and E. coli as fecal source tracking, along with human mtDNA as a direct marker. It was indicated that BacHum had correlations with coliforms at a correlation coefficient of 0.76. In addition to application of mtDNA as microbial source tracking marker in surface water and wastewater, mtDNA has indicated a potential as a microbial marker to detect fecal contaminations in stormwater or heavy rainfalls. Waso, Khan, and Khan (2018) successfully designed a novel mtDNA to target mtDNA Cytochrome b gene via mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA) with PCR that detected pigeon fecal contamination in the harvested rainfalls. The high host sensitivity (100%) and host specificity (96%) was obtained after screening all the fecal samples, which had an excellent performance based on the criteria of EPA. For newly designed MST markers, the standard established by EPA for host sensitivity and host specificity ise 80%. In addition, they analyzed the concurrence of pigeon mtDNA marker with other indicator organisms, including heterotrophic bacteria, E. coli, total coliforms, and fecal coliforms. Their results demonstrated that pigeon mtDNA marker in this study could be applied as a supplemental tool along with other indicators due to relatively high concurrence frequency.",

In a study by McLellan and Eren (2014) , HF183 primer and ruminant markers indicated that Bacteroidales are present in ruminant hosts and other species. However, comparing Bacteroidales host genetic markers illustrated that humanspecific markers were less stable than ruminant markers. In another study conducted by Kirs et al. (2016) , Bacteroidales spp. (HF183 TaqMan) markers as the indicators were used to determine sewage contamination in Hawaii. They concluded that concentration of HF183 in human fecal samples was 1,000-fold more than the animal fecal samples. Also, Kirs and colleague compared the decay rate of HF183 with enterococci under sunlight and dark conditions and showed that the decay rate of HF183 was significantly lower than enterococci in sunlight, while the decay rate was very similar in the dark. Moreover, the sensitivity (80%) and specificity (78%) were detected relatively high for human samples, and therefore, Bacteroides can be applied to identify the origin of fecal pollution and waterborne pathogens. Marti et al. (2013) studied the relations among MST marker (Bacteroides), fecal bacteria indicators (FIB), and pathogens. They concluded that presence and absence of the Bacteroides marker were not correlated to FIB, but positively related to pathogens such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia. In another study conducted by Newton, VandeWalle, Borchardt, Gorelick, and McLellan (2011) , Bacteroides as MST marker was used to evaluate chronic human sewage contamination in urban harbor. Their experimental results indicated that total Bacteroidales spp. were abundant in human fecal samples, which illustrated strong correlations with human fecal contamination.

Close relationship between Bacteroides and Lachno2 confirmed the feasibility of using this indicator as an excellent candidate for host-associated fecal indicator alternative to Bacteroides for determining human fecal pollution in surface water. In a recent study by Feng, Bootsma, and McLellan (2018) , designated genetic markers, termed as Lachno3 and Lachno12, which dominate in V6 region, were evaluated to detect human and animal fecal pollution in urban water. These assays were assessed with fecal samples of cat, dog, pig, cow, and deer. Although both Lachno3 and Lachno12 markers were primary human-associated, Lachno12 marker was detected at low levels in samples from dogs and cows, while Lachno3 marker was detected only in human fecal contamination or sewage.

Therefore, detection and quantification of these pathogens in water bodies have become critical portions of water quality assessment. Microbial indicators have shown correlation with pathogens, and hence, they can be used as a surrogate to evaluate microbial quality in water bodies. However, many pathogens may not behave like fecal microbial indicators and no indicator has been developed for their presence. As database for these pathogens grows in future years, we may find microbial indicators specific to those pathogens of public health importance. Until then, combining various microbial indicators from different taxonomic groups may be required for better quantification and detecting co-occurrence of the pathogens.",
