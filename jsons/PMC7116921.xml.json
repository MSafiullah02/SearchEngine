            "text": "CDC communications and broadcast transcripts issued between July 24 and December 29, 2014 were selected for analysis. This time period was chosen because CDC released its first communication related to the Ebola outbreak on July 31, 2014 and its last communication on December 22, 2014. A week was added onto the start and end dates to ensure completeness. \u201cCDC communications\u201d was defined as all official telebriefing transcripts, press releases and media statements related to Ebola. A total of 45 official communications materials related to the Ebola outbreak were issued within the designated time period and downloaded from the CDC website. AdWeek ratings from the week of July 28, 2014 were used to determine the top three United States (U.S.) broadcast networks by primetime viewership: Fox News, CNN and MSNBC (\u201cThe Scoreboard: July 28, 2014\u201d). Primetime is traditionally defined as 8pm to 11pm. Nielsen, a global company that manages the Nielsen television rating measurement system, states that more Americans watch television from 9:15pm to 9:30pm than any other period during primetime and that the end of the primetime period (10:45 to 11:00pm) is when the fewest number of viewers are watching (Nielsen, 2011). As a result, this study chose to include only primetime broadcast news shows airing from 8pm to 9pm and 9pm\u201310pm on each network; they included The O'Reilly Factor (Fox News), The Kelly File (Fox News), Anderson Cooper 360 (CNN), All In with Chris Hayes (MSNBC), and The Rachel Maddow Show (MSNBC). Using LexisNexis, transcripts from shows that aired during the designated time period were identified (n = 592) and then reviewed for the search term \u201cEbola.\u201d Transcripts that only mentioned Ebola in preview clips for shows airing at a later time were excluded. A total of 164 transcripts were identified for coding.",

Categories represent either explicit or inferred communication, and as there is no contact with the source being studied, is classified as a more unobtrusive method (Hsieh and Shannon, 2005). The authors first randomly selected 25 articles (of 209 total articles, or 12%). Both authors reviewed all 25 articles using a content analysis approach and an initial coding key was developed collaboratively based on relevant frames used in this set of articles. The first author then coded this set of 25 articles. The second author reviewed the 25 articles coded by the first author to discuss and decide upon changes to the coding key. Both authors then coded a random selection of five of the 25 articles using the refined coding key. When disagreements arose, the authors referred to the code list definitions to come to an agreement and the code list was revised in an iterative fashion, and an additional randomly selected five articles of the original set of 25 articles were coded by both authors to finalize the coding key. Both authors then coded the entire set of 25 articles with the agreed upon final coding key. Inter-rater reliability of these 25 articles was satisfactory (\u03ba = 0.85). After this step, the first author then coded the remaining articles. After coding by the first author was complete, the second author reviewed a selected random sample of coded articles (approximately 10% of the articles) to verify themes. At this point in the analysis, as disagreements were few, articles were not recoded. Coded articles were recorded using Microsoft Excel (2013).",

Thematic news frames deliver information through a general content or environmental lens, while episodic news frames highlight discrete or individual events (Iyengar, 1991). News coverage during the designated time period was both thematic and episodic; while coverage included discrete or individual events (e.g., individual cases of Ebola or human interest stories), CDC and primetime broadcast news communications frequently featured commentary that provided contextual background or an environmental lens; additionally, coverage of individual cases universally included contextual background. The thematic frame was therefore chosen for this study's analysis.",

The human interest frame included communications with profiles of Ebola patients or individuals touched by Ebola. The socio-political context frame included communications about travel bans, quarantine, or U.S. military assistance and communications that referenced the respective scale of the outbreak to others. Finally, the unconfirmed information frame included communications with speculative or unconfirmed information.

Additionally, framing is influenced by a variety of externalities, which this study was not able to account for in its analysis. Finally, it is unknown how the public interpreted CDC or media messaging, and future research should address this gap.
