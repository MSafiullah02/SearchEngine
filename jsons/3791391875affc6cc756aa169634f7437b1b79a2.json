This, however, is a dangerous myth, sidelining the increased vulnerability of those most socially and economically deprived. In response to the pandemic, UK policymakers imposed lockdown on its 66 million citizens, an act without parallel since WWII. Though enacted for the public's wellbeing, these policies have shown disregard towards those most economically disadvantaged. To date, policymakers have targeted people with multiple comorbidities after identifying them as the most vulnerable. However, this medical model of disease risks ignoring social factors, which can increase exposure to and mortality from COVID-19.",

First, economically disadvantaged people are more likely to live in overcrowded accommodation -7% of people from the poorest 20% of UK households live in overcrowded housing, a risk factor for lower respiratory tract infections (1,2). Poor housing conditions, limited access to personal outdoor space and overcrowding will reduce compliance with social distancing. Second, financially poorer people are often employed in occupations which do not provide opportunities to work from home (3). This includes but is not limited to supermarket and warehouse workers, those in certain forms of public transport and bus drivers, whose tragic deaths we have already witnessed.",

This will likely lead to poorer health outcomes from COVID-19 for economically disadvantaged people. Fifth, access to healthcare is also determined by a person's ability to use health services \"with ease, and having confidence that you will be treated with respect\" (8) . This can be hindered by language barriers, patients' attitudes towards healthcare providers and the behaviour and attitudes of healthcare professionals towards minority patients (8) . Healthcare does not exist in isolation, so discrimination in wider society influences healthcare professionals' practice and patient expectations, such as the anticipation of being dismissed, ridiculed or humiliated which may deter minority groups from accessing healthcare. These factors may also reduce access to healthcare for COVID-19 for patients of low SES.",

Possible causal mechanisms include an increased exposure to the virus, the stress and comorbidities associated with poverty and reduced access to healthcare. UK policymakers rapidly identified people with multiple comorbidities as particularly vulnerable. However, they must expand their definition of vulnerability to include social factors as risks for COVID-19. The pandemic has highlighted the stark inequalities within society, and it will likely exacerbate them. To address the vulnerabilities of the most economically disadvantaged within society, policymakers must introduce long-term legislation to improve social welfare.",
