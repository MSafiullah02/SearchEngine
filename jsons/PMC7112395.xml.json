Of the three types of influenza viruses\u2014A, B, and C\u2014only types A and B cause widespread outbreaks. Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on antigenic differences between their two surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. 15 haemagglutinin subtypes (H1\u2013H15) and nine neuraminidase subtypes (N1\u2013N9) have been identified for influenza A viruses (figure 1\n). Viruses of all haemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes have been recovered from aquatic birds, but only three haemagglutinin subtypes (H1, H2, and H3) and two neuraminidase subtypes (N1 and N2) have established stable lineages in the human population since 1918. Only one subtype of haemagglutinin and one of neuraminidase are recognised for influenza B viruses.",

It is the major antigenic determinant of type A and B viruses to which neutralising antibodies are directed and the crucial component of current influenza vaccines. An important function of neuraminidase, the second major antigenic determinant, is to catalyse the cleavage of glycosidic linkages to sialic acid, thereby assisting in the release of progeny virions from infected cells. Accordingly, neuraminidase has become an important target for antiviral activity. The M2 ion channel of influenza A, which is blocked by the antiviral drug amantadine, regulates the internal pH of the virus, which is crucial during early viral replication.",

During antigenic drift, new strains of virus evolve by accumulation of point mutations in the surface glycoproteins. The new strains are antigenic variants but are related to those circulating during preceding epidemics. This feature enables the virus to evade immune recognition, leading to repeated outbreaks during interpandemic years. Antigenic shift occurs with the emergence of a \u201cnew\u201d, potentially pandemic, influenza A virus that possesses a novel haemagglutinin alone or with a novel neuraminidase. The new virus is antigenically distinct from earlier human viruses and could not have arisen from them by mutation (figure 2\n).",

Consequently, the morbidity and mortality from influenza are probably greatly underestimated in these regions. During summer, 2002, an epidemic of respiratory illness with 22 646 cases and 3% case-mortality affected Madagascar; it was attributable to influenza A/Panama/ 2007/97-like (H3N2) virus. The loss of life was greatest in young children and was ascribed to malnutrition and poor access to health care.16 Another outbreak attributable to influenza A/Panama/2007/97-like (H3N2) virus occurred during November and December, 2002, in the district of Bosobolo, Democratic Republic of Congo. The case-fatality rate was 3\u00b75% in children younger than 5 years and 3\u00b72% in people over 65. These rates illustrate the seriousness of such outbreaks and are one of the reasons why improved linkage of morbidity and mortality analysis with virological surveillance is one of the key objectives of the WHO Global Agenda on Influenza, formulated in 2002.",

This outbreak, which followed serious outbreaks of avian H5N1 influenza in chicken farms, signalled the possibility of an incipient pandemic. The human influenza isolates were of avian origin and were not derived by reassortment.19 The high mortality (six of 18 patients died from acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organ failure, most previously healthy young adults20) suggested an unusually aggressive clinical course. Deterioration was rapid, with pneumonia necessitating ventilatory support developing within a few days of illness onset. Striking features of severe cases were the early onset of lymphopenia and high concentrations of serum transaminases. Fortunately, there were few if any secondary infections, and the H5N1 outbreak ceased when all chickens in Hong Kong (about 1\u00b75 million) were slaughtered. The territory's poultry stocks were again depopulated when highly pathogenic A/Hong Kong/97 (H5N1) virus re-emerged in flocks in May, 2001, and February and April, 2002. However, no further human cases of H5N1 influenza were identified until February, 2003, when two cases were confirmed in a family of Hong Kong residents.",

The illness in both was mild and self-limited.22 No serological evidence of H9N2 infection was found in family members or health-care workers who had close contact with the children; thus, H9N2 viruses, like H5N1 viruses, seem not to be easily transmitted from person to person.23 Three lineages of H9 virus have been defined, with the prototype viruses being Gl, G9, and Y439.24 The Gl \u201cavian\u201d H9N2 viruses isolated from human beings have some receptor properties similar to those of other human viruses\u2014ie, binding to a2,6 sialic acid linkages, in contrast to the binding preference to the a2,3 linkages normally found with avian influenza viruses. In Hong Kong, antibody to H9 viruses was found in about 4% of blood donors,22 which suggests that human infection with H9N2 may occur in this locality. Surveillance of pigs in southern China has shown that H9N2 viruses are cocirculating with human A/Sydney/97-like H3N2 viruses and other porcine H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Together, these observations indicate that all the precursors of potentially pandemic H9 human-avian reassortants are in place.",

Within their licensed indications, zanamivir and oseltamivir are both recommended for the treatment of at-risk adults, and oseltamivir for the treatment of at-risk children, who present with influenza-like illness and can start therapy within 48 h of the onset of symptoms, when it is known that influenza A or B is circulating in the community. NICE guidance on the use of antiviral drugs for the prevention of influenza was also issued lately.135 Oseltamivir is recommended for postexposure prophylaxis of influenza in at-risk people aged 13 years and older, who can begin prophylaxis within 48 h, if they live in a residential care establishment, whether or not they have been vaccinated, and a resident or staff member has influenza-like illness; or if they are not effectively protected by vaccination and can begin prophylaxis within 48 h of exposure. Oseltamivir is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis of healthy people up to age 65 years or for seasonal prophylaxis. Amantadine is not recommended for either postexposure or seasonal prophylaxis. This guidance does not cover the circumstances of a pandemic.",

The problems encountered in 1997 were due mainly to the dangers of working with the chicken H5N1 virus and the need to produce a safe vaccine strain. Conventional technology was unable to produce a safe productive vaccine strain. However Li and colleagues136 were able to modify the haemagglutinin gene of the A/Hong Kong/97 virus. They deleted the series of basic aminoacid residues at the cleavage site associated with virulence, then by use of reverse genetics rescued the modified haemagglutinin gene and the neuraminidase gene from the wild-type A/Hong Kong/97 virus into ca A/Ann Arbor/6/60 virus. The resultant ca virus was non-pathogenic in animal models of infection, grew well in eggs, and protected chickens from challenge with lethal virus; it could be a suitable candidate vaccine strain. These experiments show the potential for using reverse genetics technology to develop live and inactivated vaccines for both pandemic and interpandemic use.",

Clinical trials of conventional inactivated-surface-antigen vaccine produced from an H5N3 virus showed that extremely poor antibody responses were stimulated, even after two doses, whereas an H5N3 subunit vaccine with MF59 adjuvant was much more immunogenic.138 The benefit of adjuvants for use in na\u00efve populations has also been shown with a whole-virus H2N2 vaccine with aluminium salts adjuvant.139 Thus, like MF59, aluminium salts have promise in increasing vaccine coverage in response to pandemic influenza by allowing scarce antigen to be used more efficiently.",
